I’m now 20 but still feel 17. ### It genuinely feels like I have not changed over the course of the last three years whatsoever. High school feels like it just happened yesterday and I think I look nearly identical now as I did when I thought I was getting a “two week spring break” back in 2020. Suddenly life has happened. I don’t even remember how I got here. I’m just 20 all of the sudden but I see myself still stuck at 17. I’m having a really hard time digesting where my life went and what has happened the last three years. I don’t really know what this means or what to do. I’m just a really lost 20 year old.

It’s really hard for me to clean my room because of my depression. My dad always gets super annoyed with me every time I don’t. I was asking my parents what chores I could do to make some money and my mom said I could clean my room. My dad immediately said, “No. she should be able to do that on her own.” In defense I said that it’s hard for me because I have depression. My mom asked me if I was self diagnosing myself. I had got diagnosed by my therapist a year earlier and they had been told this. I told them this and they said they don’t remember. I was close to tears when my dad told me that I’m just being lazy. I ran back to my room and now I’m crying. I can’t believe my parents don’t remember.", "upvotes": 227, "date": "2023-03-13 04:17:21", "emotions": ["brain dysfunction (forget)", "anger", "sadness", "hopelessness", "worthlessness"], "label_id": 11010101}
