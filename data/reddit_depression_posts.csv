post,pandemic_period
im going to be a bit harsh here because i see this expressed so often around here but a lot of you complain about never finding someone who likes you yet as more info comes out it becomes clear that you dont like any of the people who like you because theyre ugly or whatever so why do you think youre entitled to the decent beautiful people not to say you dont deserve someone youre attracted to but a lot of people here want someone usually someone who is well above average in the looks department ignoring all the people who do like you because they are just average or maybe a bit overweight or arent tall enough or has an ugly hairstyle or whatever and then say ugh no one likes me and i cant get a relationshipor get a fwb or whatever i mean seriously do you not see anything hilarious about that someone does like you you just dont like them and how do you think that feels to them probably the same way youre feeling right now but at least they tried and let their feelings be known unlike someone of you that get upset because the cashier at the grocery store only talks to you when you buy something and you hate that she just wont notice youre deeply in love with her looks because if youve barely spoken to her you know nothing about her i know a lot of us get blind to others feelings when youre depressed but look outside yourself sometimes you are not entitled to a beauty queen just because you like them then you seem incredibly focused on getting a relationship and having sex those are wonderful things but shouldnt be your focus the best advice someone ever gave me was to look at everyone as a friend first if something develops thats just icing on the cake otherwise youve made a friend and thats just as important too many of you are too focused on only getting to know someone if you want to have sex with them then wonder why you dont have friends and cant find love its ridiculous,pre-pandemic
i tried i really tried i tried to love them i tried to help my family but i never knew this would kill me inside im tired i didnt know where else to turn i thought maybe if i posted this someone would probably relate and maybe not feel that lonely because loneliness is the thing thats mostly killing me and i dont want anyone else to feel that,post-pandemic
probably sounds stupid but the only thing i look forward to everyday is laying in bed after doing nothing all day and just sleeping for 15 hours i like dreaming i wish i could sleep longer,pre-pandemic
this is truly how i feel when people ask me why im not textingcalling them back,pre-pandemic
venting my teen years were hell on earth from physical and mental hell problems which led to becoming a man of inaction in my 20s i rallied and really got my life started last year im 30 now im damn good at what i do and have huge potential but i feel like im wasting so much of my time i work hard at my 95 and i enjoy it but i could have my own business by now i dont have much but my bills are covered i just spent the weekend surfing the web and going for a walk everyday is just ups and downs i have no friends or gf i can barely drag myself out of the house except to get groceries im socially awkward so i cant network people my age or younger than me work much harder than me,post-pandemic
i am female 21 i dont have the energy to explain what is going on it was my birthday on 14 february and i have been crying since then i am just exhausted and i really dont want to live anymore i want to die quickly and painlessly because ive attempted so many times but was never successful if anyone has any suggestions pls tell me i have 50 pills for anxiety and sleep so if anyone knows if i can overdose on that pls let me know,post-pandemic

my husband and i recently bought our first home together due to cost of living being so expensive where we were we chose to look out of state dont get me wrong i am in love with my new home but im feeling so depressed lately i have chronic depression so its something that i am always going to struggle with i am lacking motivation to unpack our boxes i want to get excited about putting our furniture together and getting our new washer and dryer but instead i feel depressed,post-pandemic

it may seem hard or you might say maybe for him but not me you are not an exception you make the rules you can chose to say no no i wont let my circumstances control the outlook and my future no i wont let someone that mistreated me to make me feel like i dont deserve to live please dont give up please know that it will change i promise you things sometimes seem hopeless but they are not i came from the bottom i was beaten and broken and people turned their back on me and made me feel like i did not matter but i knew that i could not let that change what could be my hopes and dreams just keep pushing and fighting,pre-pandemic
obviously the title of the video caught my eye and he even called me out in the video i was angry and i was planning on leaving a nasty comment saying he didnt know me saying he doesnt understand the imbalance of chemicals in my brain my doctors said im depressed and im struggling so how dare he but that wasnt what hes saying hes saying my name isnt depression my name is dillon ive always said im depressed and i use my diagnosis and my meds to make it make sense in my head i always get pissed off when someone tells me its in my head or i just need to think better or even the back handed i hope you feel better and i dont think theyre made maliciously at all but ive always identified as depressed because thats how i felt and thats what my doctor said i am after i watched this video it gave me a better point of view im not depressed im dillon i deal with depression more than most people less than others but im not depression im dillon i drum i play video games i loved taking and editing pictures i love taking my dog out for walks i put a lot of effort into looking into tech blogs and wished i drew more to be a better artist but i feel depression sometimes and it fights me in my head it looks like a scene from dragon ball z but i keep going because im dillon im not depression this isnt something i have to live with for the rest of my life this is my biggest challenge yet but its not me maybe i stay medicated maybe i dont but happiness is a choice one i need to make more often i personally need to stop comparing my making of to other peoples highlight reel i wasnt born as lucky as others so what my future is my doing dillons doing not depressions doing i can do anything i want to one way or another harder than some easier than others this too shall pass im dillon not depressed,pre-pandemic
bc fuck no im too anxious and selfconscious to be the one to initiate the conversation yes i need someone but im anxious to talk to strangers let alone confide in them i know they mean well and are just trying to help but i cant do it bc im too anxious to initiate the pm dammit and then i just hope someone initiates it instead but it never happens am i the only one,pre-pandemic
it makes me feel safe it makes me feel at home it will never laugh at me i will never feel insecure or exposed or watched while at bed i can cry in my bed for hours on end and never will it say mean things to me or make me feel bad i wont bother it and i wont disappoint or fail it nor does it i can sleep on it which is the best part of the day and it makes me feel cozy and warm my bed is my best friend and i love it to death,pre-pandemic
people who come here are not here for the karma additionally depressedanxious people tend to be sensitive to things that may seem insignificant to others a down vote may reinforce feelings of inadequacy and it just seems to me to be completely unnecessary,pre-pandemic
i hate my body i want to change it so bad im trans 18yo and i cant really afford surgeries i dont even give a fuck what happens i want it gone,post-pandemic
been battling depression for years the last 2 years have been the worse i stopped drinking last year and it helped a bit but not much have been adjusting my medication which tend to help but just a little recently i took leave from work and joined an iop program and with this had to stop smoking weed currently 11 days with no weed however despite doing all this taking break from work joining a program sobriety healthy eating and ensuring longer sleep i have hit a low over the last 2 days why does nothing help seems i can drink and stay up late or do all of the above and both give me good and horrible days but one isnt better than the other am i wasting time in iop it feels like a joke is no weed dumb i dont plan on quitting forever just want moderation im just rambling because im loss and trying to be better for myself my wife and my 2 boys thanks for taking the time to read my rambling,post-pandemic
thank you for anyone taking the time to read this right now im very confused i feel lonelysad and apathetic about everything and i dont understand why im trying to think of what genuinely makes me happy but other that rotting in my room playing on my console i honestly cant think of anything else that gives me happiness i have a few friends but even at times i cant even tell if they actually like me or not i hope i dont sound too dramatic and i dont know if im dealing with depression but i feel teary and i dont know why i just wish i was back to being a child again sorry if i sounded cringe but i really need to know why i feel this way,post-pandemic
happens to me a lot cooking walking to class brushing my teethsometimes i just stop for like a minute feel a tremendous sense of selfhatred and suicidal ideation and then continue on as if nothing ever happened,pre-pandemic
most days i find it hard to brush my teeth and its taking its toll anybody else have problem brushing their teeth everyday,post-pandemic
for normal people with healthy brains honestly do those even exist anymore whenever things in their life are going wrong they do what they can to fix it and get better for those of us who are depressed and do not have that luxury weve lost interest in caring for ourselves theres no clear path on how to fix our lives and the chances of actually succeeding are minimal at best the amount of effort required is too great and we find life and especially our own lives to be meaningless so why bother trying ive grown more apathetic towards life and i really can be bothered to care much about myself i see my mental state getting worse and life passing me by bit really i just dont care i find myself unable to relate to others when they talk about their futures because i genuinely dont see one for myself and im not interested in trying to build one especially when i have no building materials and no way of obtaining them this has to be the worst part about being depressed its an illness that makes you not care enough to get help and better yourself leading to a slow decline with endless sadness and misery while your physical health worsens if that isnt the scariest illness then i dont know what else is,post-pandemic
recently i think ive been okay not super happy but not completely down in the dumps but ever since about a week ago ive been getting passive suicidal thoughts if you dont know what that is its when you think about suicide but have no actual plan or motive to do it this has happened every day even this morning my first thought when getting out of bed was i should just die these thoughts get annoying as it demotivates me from what i have to do during the day which makes me feel useless which makes me think about suicide its an endless fucking cycle and i hate it,pre-pandemic
ive never hugged anyone before i just want to know what the warmth of another person feels likeim so tired of being alone im so pathetic im laying here trying to sleep and i just cant stop crying like a dumbass hugging a blanket,pre-pandemic
i dont deserve this life,post-pandemic
to all those who struggle with depression im very new to this illness but it has changed me entirely in the short amount of time it has been a part of my life im happy to say im finally starting to feel better and without any counseling medication anything just some talks with lifelong friends and a lot of looking inward even though the past 7 months of my life has been hell i have still found the tiniest nugget of positivity out of it all this is the cheesiest thing i could say but goddamnit its been proven to be true what doesnt kill you makes you stronger yes youve heard it 10000 times in songs in movies in books and it probably has lost its meaning to you at this point but i have realized that the trials and tribulations i have gone through these past few months have made me different yes but i can honestly say for the better i have done so much thinking obsessive thinking about my depression and this new me that was formed by the hot coals of my afflictions is so much wiser so much stronger than the naive stoner kid i used to be so while i still do have problems most days the one thing that always gets me through it is knowing that no matter what happens i will come out the other end a stronger soul i really hope this helped somebody it feels absolutely amazing getting this all out one love,pre-pandemic
wanted to wait until im 21 but fuck it itll probably be just a few days until i get the courage but if its anything like my last attempts ill just survive anyway hope i dont this time lol,post-pandemic
so i made a new account because i dont want to talk about this on my normal reddit account so when i was growing up a friend and i both dudes used to watch softcore porn during sleep overs nothing sexual would happen we would just check out the late night cinemax well one night after a particularly steamy skinamax my friend was asleep and i was still quite awake and horny so since i was pretty sure he was asleep i went to the other side of the room hopped on the computer and fapped to some internet porn afterwards i think i felt pretty weird about fapping in the same room as my sleeping friend but i shrugged it off and went to sleep six years later im in college and doing quite well for myself i have a girlfriend im studying biology and im getting 40s most semesters then one day out of the blue the memory of that night six years ago pops into my headand i cant stop thinking about it i felt like a total pervert or freak or something for masterbating while my friend was in the room i went to some counseling sessions the university offers but it didnt really help the counselor told me it wasnt a big deal and theres no need to freak about it and he suggested calling the friend about it so on a fateful afternoon i give this guy a call and tell him what was bothering me and he freaks out he tells me its a weird phone call and hangs up after that i became super anxious that he was going to tell my friends or that it was going to ruin my life somehow that intense anxiety soon turned into depression ive went on multiple antidepressants to no avail the following year and did talk therapy the year after the talk therapy helped but its still on my mind and it still makes me super anxious the whole story makes me feel like a creep and that i ruined my life any advice for how to deal with these obsessive thoughts about this am i right to think im a creep how the hell do i move on with my life i just want to be happy again edit so getting some feedback has really helped me out i think i just needed some perspective on all of this i blocked this guy on facebook a few months after the phone call i think i just felt really threatened by him and didnt like the idea of him having access to my facebook profilelife now though that seems pretty stupid i feel bad about that i guess i worry that i pissed him off by blocking him on facebook and it would make everything even worse if i ever saw him again that happened a year and a half ago though thoughts,pre-pandemic
how are you good thanks how are you im good thank you i hate that shit im tired of peoples fake care and concern so now when im asked how are you i tell it straight up how i am and it catches people off guard and they dont know how to react why should i hold back the truth why should i lie so that its not awkward yesterday i had to go to jb hi fi to but some headphones and this girl at the desk served me and she was probably late teens or early 20s incredibly good looking easily a 910 and the kind of girl that would rather drink 1l of horse cum than talk to me for 5 seconds so whatever shes too good for me i know so im just wanting my stuff so i can leave then i get the dreaded company protocol how are you argh this crap again im tired of it no more what do you care was my response she hit back with some crap about wanting to know how i was no you dont youre just saying it because its company and youve just opened this new store here plus i could be a mystery shopper and youll get in trouble for not saying it but ok ill call your bluff then you really want to know how i am i might go home and hang myself i told her and thats the truth she didnt know what to say and didnt even say goodbye haha but fuck it you asked and i told the truth im sick of lying about how im feeling because fake people pretend to give a shit usually when people ask me how i am now i just say that im shit and we move on,pre-pandemic

my mom and i have a better relationship now but i would sometimes get flashbacks from my childhood of her abuse and it would bring me extreme sadnessesp that if i confront about it she denies all of it a few examples are 1 blamed me for not having my menses before my younger cousin who is 1 year younger than me insinuating that my younger cousin had her menses before me bec i was immature and she being younger was more mature 2 sent me to sleep without eating as punishmentwoke up with very painful stomachache 3 sent me to use the bathroom for the helpers intead of the family bathroom while my brothers used water heaters of the family bathrooms 4 shamed me for my bed wetting i know others have it worse than me but still i had it bad i am torn between showing her the treatment she deserves vs being the better person however whenever i try to be the better person be good to her give her money have concern and care i am ridden with guilt and regret knowing she does not deserve it i have moved out of our home bec i cannot stand her any longer and go home 1x a week for my son who i allowed to live with them as my dad has cancer and has limited time what to do i want to be a good person but it is hard,post-pandemic
i picked her out today 400hr sexy as fuck going to give her the time of her life wish me luck rdepression im going to beat this depression and ascend,pre-pandemic
at least to me that is i recover every few months wont bore you with the details but i basically fix everything then i relapse it gets worse every time everything bad returns and i cant must er the energy to do anything anymore then about half a year later everything is sunshine and rainbow again four months passes and the cycle starts again honestly its barely worth it to push through when you know the progressll just collapse and dissapear anyways,post-pandemic

for context im a person who loves sleep its been my coping mechanism for as long as i can remember so tonight i slept as per usual but i randomly woke up in the middle of the night with a feeling thats pretty hard to put into words but ill try it was like an overwhelming and crushing sense of claustrophobia but kind of for life itself not even any physical situation i had a mini existential crisis then and i couldnt close my eyes i watched some youtube videos to get my mind off of it but now every time i try to go to sleep i get this crushing closingin feeling deep in my chest and it makes me panic a significant amount just want to know if anyone has experienced something similar and if so how you were able to stop it,post-pandemic

i dont think i see the world the way others do the way i perceive reality and always have is a fantasy some creation in my own mind my mind is clouded and always changing erratic and impulsive it is rare that i can actually write out my thoughts as i am right now i am more writing this to myself than anyone else when i am not in control others have always just thought i was weird add random and i just play it off as such i live my life in my memories never in the present sometimes i tell people that my past has made me who i am that things that could have broken me made me stronger its complete bullshit my past has fractured me into an unstable and dysfunctional human being my entire life revolves around being charming interesting funny sociable likable but this persona ive created has cracks and i cant always hold it together the next topic tonight is my obsession with psychopaths and sociopaths in the media i play videogames for the wrong reasons its best to explain that when i was 14 i was completely insane and thought of nothing but murdering a particular individual i channeled it through watching and delving into the darkness of the fictional serial killer dexter i now watch every episode of every season once a year for the rest of the year i try to keep my thoughts in healthy places but as time goes on i find myself searching for psychological thrillers and anything else with an evil main protagonist im also a drug addict pot head turned alcoholic turned adderallic ive been trying to get sober off adderall which im prescribed but ive given up the battle my thoughts get to dark without it im also completely void of emotion i have redeeming qualities i am like two people the good side of me you would like i promise i want to learn i want to achieve well i cant really write about the good in me because thats just not where my mind is right now my mind is not one i want to delve into to deeply right now as i have a thousand times before but suffice to say it is unlike any other i am like a nikola tesla and others know it i have never met anyone with a mind as unique huge creative and gifted as mine i know it sounds like ego but im being blunt i try to stay away from psychology i dont know why i say that my body is always aching but im ok with it as long as no one else is around and i dont have to hide it i just cant handle this anymore if i were to analyze myself from someone elses perspective who saw what was going on inside id say i was very close to the edge of my sanity not necessarily to hurting other people because i dont want to do that i want to cry so badly i think i want to cry more than i want anything else besides death what does it mean to be someone who cant cry half of what i write is a fucking lie likeable ha maybe but i dont like other people anymore im not surrounded in glamour i spend most of my time alone the only place i want to be alone to spiral down in some way i feel pain a lot of pain scratch that thats just the feeling of my lungs wanting a cigarette though perhaps some emotion is manifested in that i dont know ive closed off almost every relationship i have its like my heart is a clock running out until it hits zero and is shut i had closed it off to all but my best friend which i imagined it was still open to i hadnt seen or talked to him in months i just got back from visiting him last weekend it made me realize that i had shut him out too there is no one left and i dont care i almost want to write about my bdsm thoughts but i wont go there not tonight i need to die i have lived a short life and it has been far to long i need to die im an old man waiting to die alone did i really just quote inception dont bother telling me i need treatment i forgot to mention that i should no longer be around people ive been having outbursts cracks ive been assaulting the kids at school in fits of blind rage i cant control myself i need to die or just go away far far away far far far far hmm hmm hmm hmmh mhmm why does the music never fucking stop why it never fucking stops there is always music in my head always from the minute i wake to the second before i sleep music plays one line over and over and over and over and over piano from a soundtrack generally at least tonight the song is beautiful but it hurts it hurts it hurts it hurts edit goodnight i need sleep and there is a loud ringing in my head pressure maybe time stampped 313 am,pre-pandemic

i would say i am as depressed as anyone else who would call themselves extremely depressed however one thing that annoys me are the people who say theyre depressed that have it all im short ugly dark overweight and have a small penis and besides one of those i cant change any of it ill never have a girlfriend because of it mostly the inadequate height and i sometimes get super depressed for being lonely im not very picky but there are certain girls i wont date like lesbians transwomen shallow women mean and rude women etc i just want someone nice and sweet but my genetic shortcomings will make that a near impossibility as women do not like short inferior men so it seems like my depression makes sense what i dont get however are the people who seem to have it all and are still depressed like attractive women how can beautiful gorgeous women possibly be depressed they are loved by everyone and tall people the world treats you like gods i would fucking kill to be tall how can the social elites in society be depressed and rich and famous people how can an early 20something from a wealthy family be so depressed or someone with millions of fans worldwide and people with two loving parents i never even had one loving parent so how can people with a loving family be so depressed and people in relationships i really dont get this one you are depressed yet you are able to get a boyfriend or girlfriend somehow usually being depressed would make someone so negative theyd repel others away from them yet here these people are with a loving partner and getting laid wheneve they want yet still depressed i have no sympathy for these people at all i still dont even get how someone who is depressed can even be positive enough to even get a partner unless they are tallattractive that is and like i said i dont understand that either the recent december 2017 death of adult film star august ames really got to me though she was tall gorgeous really attractive and had a successful adult film career yet some sjw assholes on twitter bullying her for not wanting to risk getting an std from a male film star was enough to drive her to suicide i normally dont feel sad for deaths but suicides usually get to me especially those of people who seem to have it all i would think i wouldnt care about those people at all but i just do as a former suicide attempter i just feel bad about successful suicides even from tall attractive wealthy women with legions of fans maybe im just jealous i fucking hate being short as being under six feet is the main reason i cant get a girlfriend so i deeply envy men over 60 and women over 59 im ugly so i deeply envy people so attractive they get people flocking to their feet to want to be with them im old 31 so i hate seeing these 19 year olds who complain about being forever alone just barely out of puberty while i have 12 years more experience than them in the same field and yes i am a forever alone as i cant even find any straight escorts around here theyre all either lesbians or traps there are tall gorgeous women in a relationship with a steady job who are depressed and im sorry but i just dont have any sympathy for you maybe if a loved one of theirs suddenly died or something but not over petty first world problems like your boobs being too big or having too much positive attention from others or having too much money to spend at once and i know everyones problems are valid to them some would argue i shouldnt complain about being short when they dont even have legs to walk on so i get it but i still cant feel any sympathy for these people i dont know maybe you can help make me understand the tall the attractive the rich the extroverted the successful the loved the nonsingle especially i just dont sympathize with your depression you have it all so i just dont get it,pre-pandemic

just like the title says i am 58 m i visit rdepression every day and start by clicking new while reading the posts i am always looking for those in my age bracket which is few and far between my depression has its roots in 2001 but it really took hold during the financial collapse starting in 2008 when i first visited my therapist about 6 weeks ago i typed a one page summary of my life from 2001 to current it wasnt pretty went from a financially secure entrepreneur business owner great father decent husband community volunteer coach etc to lost house broke in debt irs issues depressed mother fer the issues were caused by me putting my head in the sand and not being proactive before i always took the initiative and created opportunity slowly but surely i lost that ability and piece by piece my world came crumbling down so my story is different than a young person facing depression as a sophomore in college or a 16 year old afraid to tell their parents about their depression i care about what they write because i have 2 children 30 25 and i hope they never experience what we are going through but i still read every new post because i hope to find the answer to my condition ok time to go and look at the pile of important things to do and decide if i am going to take the initiative or go into my typical depressive state have a good day,pre-pandemic

have any of you guys had experience with healing crystals so last night i had an emotional purge last night crying and letting go of all the negative emotions i had in the past attached to people among cleaning up my room i came across a 250 beaded freshwater pearl necklace my grandma gave to me when i was younger i wrapped it around my arms and felt lighter curiously i googled the benefits of pearls and i immediately felt the emotional burden wash away gaining a stronger ground and understanding of the past i was dwelling so heavily on for months not sure if its the law of attraction in place but reading benefits of crystals and allowing them to do their thing on you while you wear them seems to really be helping me please share your experiences,pre-pandemic
lately ive been neglecting sleep because i cant overcome the anxiety of having to wake up and think about all the things im behind on whether its school or even socially it feels like when im awake a long period of time i can just manage my stress unfortunately as ive been neglecting sleep its gotten me in trouble with my parents and its mostly because i have a hard time telling them the truth as to why im not sleeping idk just feels like im trapped edit i find it hard talking to my parents or a therapist because i hate when people feel bad for me ive seen one therapist in the past and it sort of worked but i always feel awkward and embarrassed telling them my problems,pre-pandemic

im 16 and i have literally no friends but 2 online friends who live across the country i havent talked to people who arent my family in so long that i genuinely forgot what its like to have a conversation i dropped out of school basically in the 8th grade so my academic knowledge is nonexistent the main reason i eventually dropped out was extreme social anxiety i was going to kill myself once in 7th grade but my mom came back from her car and stopped me im addicted to porn and in the past 4 months its been very difficult to go a week without it and in the past month very difficult to go a day without it ive never had a girlfriend never kissed a girl never even held hands with a girl romantically or at all really and i cant even begin to imagine doing so my appearance is awful i hate my face im slightly overweight for my height i hate my voice im the definition of unathletic im not good at anything the amount of video games ive played in my life time compared to how good i am at them is laughable i dont know how to drive and i dont know how to talk to people its extremely difficult to do anything thats even slightly out of my comfort zone which is basically anything thats not playing games rotting in bed on my phone eating way too much and unhealthy as shit or watching porn and masturbating when i am able to attempt something out of my comfort zone i give up immediately i dont know whats wrong with me sometimes i kind of want my life to get worse because then ill have an excuse to be depressed my living conditions are good apart from my parents never getting married and showing little love to each other over the years and my dad being possibly physically abusive a long time ago i dont remember for sure but even then he has still done nothing but yell at me and my family my entire life and only recently has it gotten better i mean he does love us he just has issues i also literally dont say i love you to my parents brother or sister like i genuinely dont think ive said it out loud once and if i did it was when i was very young ive said it like once over text and thats it not to mention ive barely even talk to my sister like at all in the past 3ish years both of my online friends have girlfriends and are obviously still in school every time they talk about school or their girlfriends i just go silent and wanna cry because i know ill never have those experiences ever i mean even just talking to them at all recently makes me more suicidal because yes im happy for them but i just wish i could have their lives i had a dream a few nights ago about a girl who loved me so much it was such a long dream and when i woke up i wanted to cry but i just couldnt the past like 5 months ive had 2 moments where i kinda broke down and long story short both times my dad had a long talk with me on ways to improve my life i really dont know what to do like whats wrong with me ive really been considering cutting myself to see how it feels people online always say it gets better and i will say when and they say something like when you make an effort to improve your life like i dont wanna do that i dont even want it to get better at this point because i dont even deserve it i just dont see a point anymore,post-pandemic

update we are aware this person has been pming everyone whos participated in this thread with claims that we are lying about their actions i hope it goes without saying that were not one of the people who let us know what theyre up to used the phrase persecution complex and the behaviour unfortunately does seem to be consistent with that after warnings and explanations they said they would cooperate then persisted in doing exactly what we told them was against the rules after we resorted to banning the account something we very rarely do here they announced that they were going to escalate their rulebreaking behaviour the sort of person who claims to want to help but ignores a communitys rules while claiming to want to follow them is in our regretful opinion exactly the sort of person that our vulnerable ops need to be protected from if you received any pms as followup to a comment you made on this post please click report on all of them as this brings this persons behaviour to the attention of the reddit admins thanks weve had reports of pming behaviour from a serial religious proselytiser whom weve had to take action against for persistently trying to save people in this sub their favourite tactic appears to be encouraging people to join a church because its a way to find a community this is a notorious evangelical recruitment tactic dont fall for it edit i should have worded that last sentence better were not saying that all religion is notorious or anything were saying that this particular person is being deceptive and manipulative and misrepresenting themselves and their intentions in a way thats representative of the worst types of cultish religion so our issue is fundamentally not with religion but the misuse of it,pre-pandemic

all kinds of warnings do not read unless you want to read about my childhood and trauma why i am a waste of space on this dying planet and why i havent done anything about it for a long time now i have been what would be medically referred to as depressed i have my moments of joy but they quickly fade into the monotony of everything else i have no friends my parents and grandparents say they love me and care for me but i just cant accept it and im certain that my sister doesnt really like me besides that my life is better than most people dream of i have quite a bit of money my college is paid for i have all the latest technology i get good grades im not severely disabled im a whiteish male you couldnt even tell that im not straight without knowing me etc etc etc unfortunately i did experience some mild childhood trauma i was repeatedly punished never physically for small things like leaving shoes too far into the hallway or teasing my sister too much i guess i was technically hit once when the tv remote was thrown at me because my parent was having a bad day and they couldnt get the remote to work and i couldnt describe to them how to make it work i was also told a lot that i was doing things for the attention and my mother would rephrase it like maybe somewhere subconsciously you did want a little bit of attention and so i avoid attention as much as i can but i also now desperately crave the attention of my peers and when i dont get it i feel like im being lunched in the gut i have trouble accepting that anybody could like me if they dont give me constant attention being ignored is like being trapped in a white void and even screaming wouldnt get me out i believe that being told i was doing things for attention made me believe that and so i started doing things for attention another side effect of my childhood is that i lie constantly my mother might ask how are you doing and i would respond great or ok or pretty well even if i was miserable i tell them that i always take my meds on time and every day and i have even poured them down the toilet to avoid their disappointment at me not taking them i once was two months on my schoolwork and the only way they found out was because one of my teachers mentioned that i hadnt been online in quite some time that was the second time in the same year i completely fabricate stories to tell my peers but i also struggle with the actual details of my life so it all kind of blends together i like to myself when i take a picture of myself and say that it looks good i do not look good i am overweight chubby weak dirty and my parents constantly lie to me i try not to eat in hopes that i might lose weight but then i go drink a soda to distract from my thoughts i spend way too much time watching youtube it is a great way for me to get out of my own head as i can just sit back and watch another person do things that i am incapable of my reaction time is bad so i cant play many video games im not talented enough to write games so i watch dev logs im not capable of using tools so i watch people build stuff and then i watch people getting into car accidents because at least i am not that unlucky i watch a lot of fail videos street fights police chases just straight up deaths and other such things because it makes me feel like an asshole for thinking that my life was ever bad i am now on the lgbtqia floor and everyone on it had to come out to their parent or parents and i didnt it wasnt a big thing at all some of my peers were literally kicked out i shouldnt have picked this hall because someone else more deserving of it couldve used the room in a lecture today we were supposed to think of the last time we were supported validated or heard i have never been heard because i have nothing special to say i havent been validated because i have nothing to validate and support feels uncomfortable stressful and undeserved that is what inspired me to spew this garbage out now onto the other part of the title because of my twisted need for people to be happy another side effect of tiptoeing around an angry parent i will not harm myself if only to keep my family from suffering through the grief of losing a child i can imagine that my grandparents would not last much past my death as they have told me multiple times that they are only really around for myself and my sister also my parent not my mother but my father who transitioned has tried so hard to make up for my childhood and i think that if i died she would follow suit my mother would never be happy again and my sister would be even more depressed and secluded there is also the very much spoken responsibility that has been thrust onto me to save the world when i was four yes four my aunt was writing a book my sister wanted to turn bad guys into dandelions and i needed a thing one of the elements of her book was that people could take a pill to live forever i attached myself to that idea and so did my family over the years i have developed an affinity for using computers and that strengthened this idea that i was somehow smart enough to design some kind of device to cure all aging and disease in first grade i did my first ever research project on dna i went to a university and asked a professor a few questions about the state of aging research i was six years old i was placed into the highly gifted program and i skipped a grade all of that convinced my family that i was going to do something great now the current plan is to develop some form of nanobot cluster that is capable of navigating cells and repairingmodifying dna every time i question my ability to do this my parents get upset and tell me that i am super smart also every time i bring up my parents getting older they always snap back with stuff like well hopefully i wont ever have to have gray hair or im not planning on dying any time soon they have told me that there is zero pressure to do anything and that they only want me to do what i feel is best for myself but they have a vision for me and telling them that i am not as special as they think i am and that im okay with not being special would hurt them therefore i keep my mouth shut i want so badly to just be able to flip a light switch and have my existence erased from history with nobody knowing i ever existed but that is not possible haha i used to bang my head against the wall to further punish myself when i would do something wrong and i started seeing my first therapist because of that i think and no it did not feel good to write this all down i still feel like shit oh i went to the after party or my senior prom where i barely knew anyone and i took a huge hit off of a bong very bad idea i was crying on the couch for a while i never want to experience that total lack of control again but there was a point after the awfulness dissipated where i didnt care about anything and that was the last and only time i didnt go over every possible scenario in my head or worry about how annoying i was or have some song constantly rattling through my brain like some noisy neighbor yes it was illegal but that was the way of the high school i went to i guess oh that reminds me i constantly have to fight my thoughts because theyre often times awful yes this is the right time to die right over that railing it would be so fast and then youd stop worrying or occasionally it will be super fucking racist and ill feel like a piece of shit for that voice even saying the shit it does i actively have to maintain order within my brain but luckily i have a really good ability to mask everything im thinking or feeling people see what i want them to when i want them to that comes from having to mask my own thoughts so damn much i guess im like a chameleon i change my personality to somewhat match the person im taking to and i say idk to everyone i dont know in fear of having dissonant opinions i do have my own moral compass and beliefs but they sometimes take the back burner to the beliefs of the person im talking to i have even noticed that my accent changes depending on the person im talking to i guess the term for that is a people pleaser oh and when i do something that makes people look at me for whatever reason i dont just feel embarrassment i feel shame remorse and fear that theyll remember my error ok im done for now sat august 27,post-pandemic
anyone else feel like this you dont want to end your own life you dont have the urge to do it you just hate life you wish you didnt have it you wish you didnt exist its a strange thing numb,post-pandemic

hey everyone im a us veteran and ive been going through a tough time since leaving the service three years ago recently ive mustered up the courage to start utilizing my benefits and seeking help from doctors i visited a psychiatrist a couple of weeks ago and was diagnosed with major depressive disorder the doctor prescribed lexapro and recommended therapy which ill be starting soon its been a difficult journey managing my mental health while juggling school and work which eventually led me to quit my job even focusing on school has become overwhelming on top of that ive lost touch with most of my friends and my roommates see me as a liability the trauma from my military service has been weighing heavily on me and ive struggled to process it until now with everything going on in the world and my financial struggles i often feel lost and alone the only solace i find is with my boyfriend but im hesitant to burden him with my issues while ive shared my diagnosis with him i havent started my medication out of fear of how it might affect our relationship im reaching out here for advice and support because i know i cant go through this alone any tips on managing medication side effects or navigating relationships while dealing with mental health issues would be greatly appreciated thank you for listening,post-pandemic
the last thing i want to do is get ahead of myself with the possibility of getting depressed over a negative response but i cant hold bad the joy in all of this ive been jobless for 3 months and the money situation has been killing me working with 170 a week from unemployment while viciously looking for another job stacked with a bunch of other things my depression has been plummeting and recently i made a post about hitting rock bottom but if things go through i could look at all of that turning around this morning i received a voice mail from a company i sent a rsum in with and had a long phone call with a very nice lady this job seems to use everything that ive learned from my previous jobs and i nailed the preinterview with style this job pays 430 more per hour than any job ive ever had and its a full time position id finally be able to afford the necessities in life and actually continue on with my head held high i have another phone interview tomorrow morning and she said if i nailed that then i pretty much have the job im so excited,pre-pandemic
yeah ill just admit it right now ive never been in a relationship im not some angsty virgin with rage i just dont feel like relationships are as enjoyable as people consider them to be if youre feeling empty youll blame it on not having a girlfriend because all of your friends have them and everyone in movies has them dont try to date every thot that looks at you while youre at starbucks wait to see someone that you could actually imagine a relationship with and make some moves you dont need to be a super alpha male who uses axe body spray to ask someone out no one is gonna judge you if you get rejected relationships arent as satisfying as you think friends are just as good and you dont need the chemical satisfaction of kissing or sex to be happy girls arent magic youll still feel empty even with a girlfriend do what feels right not what your friends or society makes you think is normal you know whats best for you dont give into the pressure of needing a girlfriend just wait until you see someone you actually have a chance with comes along there is a difference between a girlfriend you got for the sake of having a girlfriend and someone you actually like as a person no one is going to read this p,pre-pandemic
no one has empathy no one cares about people like me in fact as a young man who is white and christian this world would cheer for my death and stomp on my corpse while laughing at me i stopped eating im done fuck humanity,post-pandemic
yup this is what one of my closest friends said to me when i opened up about my struggle with suicide and how the previous year i actually tried to kill myself after years of selfharm i dont think i have ever had someone invalidate my feelings so quickly it just makes me laugh now when i hear some peoples ignorance and dismissive attitude when it comes to depression like damn lol anyway have you guys ever gotten a response like this if so share it im sure we could all use a chuckle or two,pre-pandemic
i just dont even have any idea what to do anymore ive already been struggling so much with mental problems i was experiencing some relationship problems because of this which was my initial reason for seeking help she left me on valentines day after 3 years weve lived together and been together every day for 3 fucking years and its just gone now i feel like ive been shot in the chest i dont know how to work through this i feel fucking dead i just wish she couldve given me just a little time because i hadnt even had the chance to see a psych or therapist yet to look for solutions i understand her being fed up but of all times why give up on me when im getting help im just so ready to be done she was my only person i didnt have any other social relationships for the last 3 years i was just working on us my fucking mistake i just want to curl up and die i still have my appointments but i dont even care to go anymore i was trying so so hard for her and it wasnt enough that is fucking eating away at me,post-pandemic
if you google reasons to live they pretty much all say that they carry on living because they dont want to cause pain to their loved ones i have very little loved ones and i cant express enough how little i give a shit about how sad theyre gonna be when i kill myself there is no way they will feel as terrible as i do everyday at least have the ability to get over it whereas i am condemned to this suffering until i die some other way i think about how my girlfriend will feel if she finds out ive killed myself and i just do not care i love more than anything even more than myself but i want death so badly that there is nothing that convince not to do it now my mum dad brother grandad grandma and literally everybody in my family will be devastated beyond words and i am fine with that because i will have victory for once i will fixed it at the greatest possible cost and im glad their sadness is of no concern of mine when im fucking dead i do not enjoy living as i have stated in other posts i dont care about the little things in life the smell of freshly cut grass isnt a valid reason to fucking live you jackass i may laugh at things that are funny and may enjoy making others laugh and enjoy the company and love of my girlfriend but it just isnt enough i need some other way of relief of my problems if not suicide i am not fucking willing to put in any hard work because i could just kill myself lol i need a giant stroke of luck or a huge incredibly forgiving second chance that will just make everything go away i wish all my problems could just be fixed by some miracle solution and they all say its just hard work that will fix it but no pal its suicide and its a legitimate solution it ends my problems and thats all i want im quite frankly sur people arent just okay with people suicide and that it doesnt happen even more than it does its just such an absolute and perfect solution for everything the only reason people stop is because they feel obligated to others but i just dont have that filter i feel oddly free in the solace that suicide gives me whenever a new problem arises it doesnt affect me anymore because i know that one day i wont have to deal with this shit because ill be dead and buried,post-pandemic

f18 here and i want to share something i wrote last night i havent been in this dark of a place in a while so here goes but what about my cat i thought i was her person turns out i am not a person at all just an amalgamation of beautiful thoughts and ambitious dreams wrapped up in a being plagued with a curse oh a curse yes that she was never able to accomplish any of them a soul stained with the ark of a dreamer a being cursed to see horrific sights often forgetting what is rea and what is not as she gazes into her hand mirror all she sees is a vision of her death this is something that is not new she sees herself laying in a morgue cold from the inside out they pull the sheets below her shoulders to find the very face she gazed upon within the mirror less adorned with her jewelry but just as she was when she wrote this she inspects further as there is trauma on the left side of head and face with bruises and abrasions far too cold to bleed and blister any longer she lightly caresses that side of her head and says rest well michelle as a woman seemingly standing across from her is hysterically sobbing and this was all within a moment just a small glimpse into the immense psychological torment she faces but a short glance in the mirror she reflects should i just lay about and wait for the rot and rust to get me shall i flee from the life that i know and tell my family that i jumped into the sea jump in front of a moving train walk into oncoming traffic ill die as nothing more than ambition potential just had a vision of jumping off my off my old apartment building god its hard not to succumb 22024,post-pandemic

ill admit that even years ago i wasnt very happy and had problems but i still miss the way i was back then i still had things that made me happy hobbies i enjoyed and i actually had the motivation to do them i could spend hours of my day doing something and completely forgetting the real world for a while now i cant find the motivation to do anything but i think most of all i miss how hopeful i was despite everything i fully believed that itll get better that the future will be a good one for me and ive lost that completely i dont have any hope anymore i dont have any motivation i dont have anything to look forward to and i just really fucking miss that part of me,pre-pandemic

if your a transphobe dont even bother commenting ive been closeted for a year now and i finally realized that no one accepts me everyone still thinks im a boy so they make fun about my girly appearance and my lack of interest in manly stuff and when i look out into the world and not my personal life i see so many people that hate that i exist that try to take away who i am and on top of that i was already extremely depressed but i was never suicidal at this point its becoming a chore to wake up and to look at myself in the mirror and to tell myself that i love myself there used to be days where i could and some where i couldnt but now it seems like i dont even want to wake up anymore its not even like an active thought like i used to think it would be its just a tiredness from living its sounds stupid but i literally just want to sleep forever but i dont want to die like if i could put my life on pause and just stop for a minute im assuming im gonna get some dickhead in the comments saying that trans people should be killed or some shit because they always say that and just know that i dont care anymore transphobia at this point only annoys me slightly im not gonna let some random reddit comment try to invalidate me when i can barely get the energy to smile i feel truly alone i know that im not i have many friends and family members and a girlfriend but they wont and will never understand what its like to be me or to be trans ive been battling addiction for like 3 years now and at this point i dont see an end im not planning on doing any harmful drugs but my moto when i was a kidno joke was that if im gonna end my life i would try harder drugs before i do that what the fuck am i typing i hate how casual this sounds to me i was 12 when i first thought that im to poor to afford a therapist and when i was going to get one my parents never followed through so now i look for comfort through the support of people online and drugs since no one cares about my feelings and no one can know im trans i dont think i am going to end my life at all but this tiredness of living is so degrading idek what this post was about originally but i needed to say all of that hopefully i dont get to scared and delete this i think its important to see how homophobia and transphobia affect us and the youth,post-pandemic
i dont have a lot to add im depressed i guess this has been going on for decades i dont know anymore am i really depressed anymore or has it turned into something else i hate being awake i wake up every day in a state of shock overcome with dread i sleep as much as possible but i have always had insomnia so i only get a good nights sleep every 23 weeks i snap awake as soon as i start falling asleep ive tried medication therapy and jesus but nothing has helped i recently realized that living with my father is a huge source of stress and anxiety for me hes emotionally and mentally abusive to me every day i am moving out soon which is great i hope but i am not expecting all my problems to magically disappear despite it all i am working hard to get a good education and build a better life for myself why i honestly dont know because its expected of me i guess what do i want out of life to be happy of course but we all know that happy isnt realistically achievable life is never perfect so i guess i am aiming for something more modest like contentment to me contentment would be a quiet simple life with very little stress not a lazy life per se but one where there is little or no pressure on me to do things i simply dont want and dont need to do x200b at this point of my life i have spent so much time in my head that i feel ive become unrelatable to regular folks,post-pandemic

hi my older brother 26m has had severe depression and anxiety as long as i can remember hes been seeing a psychiatrist probably since he was 18 and has been through countless medications and trials to try to make it more manageable on top of that he always has health issues whether it be a kidney stone needing to get surgery problems with his knees theyre is always something wrong at one point is was bearable but i feel he is ruining my parents and the home they live in he still lives at home barely speaks only comes out of his room for food or is complaining to my parents about a different problem he has he is disgusting doesnt clean up after himself leaves crap everywhere like a kid he always quits his job due to a new medical problem and still has my parents paying for his car and other things such as phone he doesnt have friends no partner and little to no hobbies he has no plans to move out and still mooches off my parents groceries and money i know im coming off as rude and impatient but i have been dealing with this for years and at my wits end my parents feel like prisoners in there own home i luckily am in college and able to come and go but every time im back on break i want to leave the house is so depressing no one speaks to each other there is a constant negative aura and its because of him we have a hard time speaking to him about this as its like walking on egg shells and we are afraid he will do something as he has attempted suicide before he has a psychiatrist he sees regularly i just feel helpless being a plane ride away i used to be close with him but not anymore and dont even know how to talk to him because i resent him so much i just dont understand how he doesnt get how hes ruining my parents lives and he acts like he doesnt care my parents have extremely stressful jobs and lives and hes one of the leading causes we did have an intervention with him about 5 years ago which worked for about a year before he became like this again any advice is needed i told my mom to kick him out but she refuses and is scared what will happen to him,post-pandemic

i genuinely dont want to be an older age the idea of saying 26 or 27 when someone asks how old i am sounds fucking horrible to me im just about coping with the fact that im 25 now not because going into your late 20s is an objectively bad experience its more so because of how society especially the college age and below vilify and basically makes fun of being around those ages its the your pushing 30 and youre still doing this or that that i constantly see its the whole age gap conversation that i feel like i see every other day on social media the idea that ill soon be seen as a creep for being attracted to a 20 yo is so deeply depressing to me especially cause i feel like i was just 192021 myself and i blew that whole period of my life living like a hermit just letting the weeks months and birthdays just come and go i feel like my youth is gone and more than anything i want a second chance at it i just feel like people my age are already parents in seriouslong term relationships and a few are even engagedmarried life truly is moving too fast and a large part of me wants out,post-pandemic

i have recently come to the observation that i ruined my entire life because i was chasing what i cant have instead of working on myself this applies to girls jobs material things and other aspects of my social life but i want to talk about my dating life as nothing better shows what a loser i am this is the timeline for my entire dating life 12 16 chased and pretty much stalked a girl i was in love with almost got suspended from school because of my actions 16 got a girlfriend for 2 months that liked me because someone told me and i kissed her at some point pretty much ruined it by being a pussy 16 18 chased the same girl from before again completely obsessed police got involved and pretty much ended it 18 fresh out of school met a beautiful girl she liked me for some reason kissed her got into a relationship i thought this was the one first time i kissed someone i loved 2 months later she started crying while were making out and talked about her ex i obviously ruined it again by being a pussy 18 19 obsessed over the previous relationship and started stalking her go me 19 20 met new girl got obsessed and never told her but also didnt even try to find another girl tried to abstain from stalking her but it ended in tragedy as my best friend banged her in the bathroom on my birthday 20 22 felt empty inside every time a girl spoke to me i instantly fell in love too bad my acne blew up and i didnt even try to get anyone because of it 22 24 caved in and started a longdistance relationship with someone i didnt even meet because i thought i would never find one otherwise it sucked i met her once had sex went home and she broke up 24 27 met new girl again got obsessed and this is where i am right now she has a boyfriend ironically the same one that banged the other girl on my birthday and doesnt realize i like her in the meantime there were 5 girls that liked me i invited one to a date so we went but i didnt even try to start anything with her as i wanted the other one the other 4 i pretty much ignored they made it really clear they liked me but i didnt care in the slightest now still obsessed with the same girl dont care about anyone else she recently wanted to set me up with some other girl that finds me attractive i didnt care and i still dont i dont even want to try i want her i have absolutely no motivation to try and get with anyone else so now most days im just sitting around at home asking myself why i cant find love ironic isnt it there were multiple women who i easily couldve started something with but it just feels so wrong as i always want someone else at the time and throughout the entire time i feel depressed and dont really do anything nothing really motivates me everything feels empty especially conversations i have with anyone but the girls im obsessed with feel empty i also never felt like doing anything with anyone but those girls nothing feels like it matters if i dont do it with them i dont know how to get out of this mindset it feels like i would have to settle for something less if i took one of the girls that liked me instead and i dont want that i want the one im in love with and noone else this is just an example of one aspect of my life its pretty much the same with everything else i dont want to do the things im good at but i want to do the things i cant do or have but i also dont have the motivation to change that so im just rotting away at home while theres so much i could do i just cant for some reason,pre-pandemic
growing up i had never really been depressed and always tried to look at the positives but 2 days ago i watched my girlfriend die she was my soul mate we connected instantly when we met at work i had currently been in a toxic relationship when we met so we didnt date until a year later but we instantly became friends and after a little bit of drama we started dating but i knew by then that she was the one she understood me like nobody else and i understood her she was good at everything i struggled with and i was good at everything she struggled with we never really fought we only slightly bickered from time to time but it was never anything seriouswe were planning on finishing college and then we were gonna get married but we decided to go visit my familys cabin in the mountains with some friends and on the way home my truck broke down we called a tow and as he arrived we all stood in the ditch waiting for him to tow it then a speeding car came rushing in and slid on the ice and hit me and my beautiful girlfriend once i woke up i immediately rushed to her but she was covered in blood and she wasnt breathing i tried to give her cpr but she was already gone and i cant stop seeing her cold lifeless face in those few seconds i lost my future and my other half i feel so alone and dont really want to live anymore i cant see a future without her in it the thought never even once occurred to mebecause i know she was truly my soul mate and i will never find anyone like her i miss her smile and her goofy songs she would sing i miss the way she would put her feet in between my legs before bed i miss how she would force me to brush my teeth at night because i was being lazy i just miss her so much and dont know what to do and i want to believe that she is in heaven looking down on me but why would god take such a beautiful and loving girl away from me i wish i had saved her i wish i had jumped in front of her so i was gone and she could still be here,post-pandemic
idk if theirs just something wrong with me but ive never been able to make any friends i thought thing would get better as an adult when i moved to different states have moved twice anytime i do talk to ppl im just the extra friend or no one shows up i try to talk about how im feel doesnt really matter i have 6 siblings only one of them talks to me shes only 16 so kinda feels like im just the annoying older sister none of my brother reply with more then one worded answer im no contact with my mom no grandparents so i have no family im married kinda obvious my husband get annoyed of me kinda feel stupid for even trying to make friends i have a fairly big social media following but it really like whats the point in saying anything for the fake ru okay or im here comments i thought ppl genuinely cared about other ppl but the older i get the more u realize ppl only care about themselves i loved my family and friends but its never once reciprocated truly r alone in this world at the end of the day,post-pandemic
this is gonna sound like a whole load of complaining but i have to vent this happens every day i dread getting on the bus at the end of the day just because i have to watch them kissing ill be doing fine and then it just spirals me back down into depression again i just dont know what to do about it,pre-pandemic
ever since ive had anxiety and depression it feels like my intelligence has just slipped away i used to be sharp in many ways i was above average even nowadays my grades are failing i have a hard time keeping up with conversation and new ideas are difficult today i tried to read a book and the words just felt so meaningless to me like i just couldnt get the full idea what has happened to me is this common with the other people on this subreddit,pre-pandemic
i have no hope i see no future and cant push myself to do the most basic of acts eg brushing my teeth how do you break through that feeling of the uselessness of your deeds how do you find the motivation to do the things you wantneed to do,pre-pandemic
this has been really scaring me lately since becoming depressed ive noticed more and more an inability to maintain thoughtful conversations with people severely reduced attention span short term memory loss severely reduced motivation i think it largely has to do with my partaking in escapism as i spend much more time browsing reddityoutube and getting high since when i actually try to focus on work i usually end up crying the result seems to be a feeling like ive been living in a haze like im never really fully aware of whats going on im just passively going through the motions of life getting out of this rut is going to be so much harder than i thought i literally feel stupider now that ive been depressed for months i can barely even talk to people in my classes now they seem so competent and on top of things while im just an embarrassment who can barely form a coherent sentence,pre-pandemic
i know that the fact that i can brush my teeth and shower each day and show up to work each day is a blessing with my depression but im also sick of constantly feeling like im about to break i hate nearly downing my pills each night only to wake up the next day to plaster a fake as smile on my face and go to work each night i think to myself i cant go on like this and each day i do part of me just somehow wishes i completely gave up and just hit rock bottom i dont know anyone else feel the same,pre-pandemic
hello there my name is daniel but you can call me dan well i just joined reddit the reason being is that you reminded me of crona from soul eater man that guygirlthe author was being a dick so he didnt give him a sex was so depressed he even said the line i wish i had never been born i laughed when he even got a zombie to say i wish i had never been brought back to life well man would you like to talk about anything really from politics to chocolate talking with another person is fun and since this is on the internet you dont have to worry about pissing me off,pre-pandemic

im sorry if i sound mad and this is a rant im fucking furious so after 3 months of waiting many years of putting all of this off i finally get to see a psychiatrist i drove 2 hours to get here spent 20 bucks on parking and i was told to fuck off this guy could barely speak english but all he talked about was how cannabis is bad and all my problems are from cannabis ive been smoking daily for 2 years now and ill admit it is a problem but ive literally been dealing with mental health issues my whole life he wouldnt even let me speak and when i did he was just drawing on his notepad he would just tell me that its cannabis and i need to go to rehab and once i stop smoking ill be fine bitch im not fucking fine there were so many things i needed to talk about i literally think i have autism and when i brought it up he didnt even acknowledge it i wanted to talk about anxiety issues and adhd and ptsd but apparently i have none of those and its just cannabis my favourite part of the whole meeting was when he told me i just need a mom i literally responded with well no shit but my mom literally just died a few months ago so thats not really an option im so fucking pissed my life is literally going to go no where and im never going to get help so this is fucking fun edit thanks for all the support guys ive got another doctors appointment set up to see a new psychiatrist so thats cool please stop upvoting and commenting haha i never wanted to get this much attention and only wanted the 3 people that usually respond lol,post-pandemic
im 14 my mom doesnt take my mental health seriously and ignores what ive tried to tell her and the reason why i want to commit suicide because of my life my family school my mom says everyday that im useless dumb why cant i be like my brother she says im a disappointment why didnt see listen to the dreams from jesus about me being a horrible daughter how she wished she could abort me when she got the chance my dad doesnt even do anything to stop my mom my mom earlier this year pushed me on the floor and choked me because she was really angry i feel worthless and pathetic i have no friends at school everyone ignores me and i have zero social skills how fun my extended family doesnt even like me my mom tells them heavily exaggerated stories about me that makes me look like a bad person im failing math because i dont get any of the material i tried seeking help but my dad gets fed up with me not keeping up at his learning pace im ugly and skinny my cousins make fun of my body saying how i look like a flat stick and on top of that i cant even think straight anymore suicidal thoughts and urges have basically took over my life i feel like the odd person always i feel disgusted with myself like i cant even look at myself without all these negative thoughts flooding in im lonely 0 social life ive been dealing with this for 5 years i cant take it anymore im burned out i have no motivation to keep going and before you say your family will be sad i do not care i am done maybe when i die i can finally seek the revenge i deserve i just want to die im still surprised that i lived to my 14th birthday my mom says to pray that i get better or that im not reading enough of the bible im sick of it she says a demon has probably took over me because i feel the way i feel she knows that im deppressed and wont let me see a therapist i hope that she can stop my brother from having the same fate as me im sorry,post-pandemic
hi ive been contemplating suicide for the last 6 months or so and i always kind of shrugged it off always telling myself i would do it when i was about to leave college around my 18th birthday well its my 18th birthday today and i have a month and a few days until college is done im feeling really shitty as of right now i just woke up hoping none of my family want to talk to me on my birthday because im ashamed of myself for getting in the state im in at the moment my dad wants to talk to me on the phone but im really afraid of the disappointment im going to get when he asks me what im doing for my 18th birthday and i say nothing 90 of people just go out and get dunk and high and have sex ive done none of these things before the first 2 out of choice i have a friend in college more of an acquaintance really who gets high almost every night does mdma and has done cocaine too but im not really interested in feeling really shit the next day im feeling the same anxiety i do when i go to the hairdressers my mum wants me to go out to dinner somewhere but i dont want to talk about why i have no friends coming over or anything i told her i would much rather just have the money that would be spent on me for dinner than go out to eat of course she sounded disappointed but said ok tldr this is supposedly one of the best days of my life and i hate it,pre-pandemic
im 19 and the loneliness is eating me up im so alone just existing for the sake of it the loneliness is eating me up touch starved they call it hating everything about me ive spent years feeling this way hoping for a better tomorrow and im still in the same position i was in college with the stress seeing others talking having fun socialising while im stuck in my head ive took a lot of thought of myself these past days and i think ending it is not so bad after all family are distant with me except for my mother but i just doesnt feel enough i dont even know what i want from life or what im even aiming for its like im just along for this miserable ride to i eventually die i just dont know anymore i brought a noose and i look at it as away out of this feels like the times i enjoyed living when i was a kid has just dried up and i feel like a old man like my life is just ended what does it mean to be happy satisfied,post-pandemic
my friend just got out of the hospital after a failed attempt to take his own life hes starting to feel better and he has offered to go grab a bite to eat and talk we are both stoners who toke up together a lot and i am wondering if it would be a bad time to smoke considering his current circumstance,post-pandemic
i dont enjoy anything anymore the hobbies i used to do just no longer interest me the older i get the less i enjoy talking to people i havent talked to the people i used to call friends in several months all i want is to go to sleep tonight and not wake up in the morming so i can just be done pretending to be a happy normal person i dont want to kill myself because my parents and people would be sad but i hate that the only thing i keep going for is so other people dont have to bury me i wish i could get sick and die or get hit by a car or anything that would let me just be done,pre-pandemic
i was having a panic attack and therapist suddenly asked if im going to hurt myself day after that really bothered me because it was so unwarranted so out of place and it felt like she was just checking off some liability box in the middle of my panic attack later i talked to the therapist about it she said shes required by her college to ask me that question otherwise she will lose her license i told her what she did made me more distressed it was unnecessary out of place and caused more harm she said she still has to ask me that question even if it causes me more distress so i asked are you saying the college comes before the patient she said yes she basically said her covering her ass is more important than her causing me distress wtf am i supposed to do with this,post-pandemic
as a teenager i thought about it a lot came close once or twice but i chickened out now i regret it so much if i had done it then only my family would have been affected and its partially their fault so maybe it would have served as a teachable moment for them now i have friends and a partner that would be absolutely destroyed if i did it they dont deserve it i wish i had done it when i still had so few attachments when there was so little harm to be done now i am condemned to exist to avoid hurting those i love fuck edit thanks to everyone that replied and for the awards i am reading every answer even if i dont reply to all its interesting to find out that so many other people feel the same way i wish us all patience perseverance strength and healing,post-pandemic

ive been depressed my whole life and recently turned 19 these past 2 months have been the most free of depression in 3 years and yet the news of robin williams suicide is really upsetting to know someone like that commits suicide and for it to upset me so much how will i ever survive someone close to me a family member or friend dying my uncle died when i was around 5 and my grandparents at a similar time aside from that ive never experienced loss i barely survived 3 years of severe depression triggered by sress at school and a relationship going badly,pre-pandemic

me17 and my gf are together now for just over 1 month everything is going great we can be ourselves around each other i love her very much but i dont know if i should tell her that im depressed i think that telling her would chance things but on the other hand i think not telling her might have some influence on the relationshipim not sure if it does so im going to give an example we cuddle alot and talk alot but when it comes to kissing her i dont know what it is but something holds me back when she kisses me it isnt a problem but i cant bring myself to make the move it is very frustrating for me but also for her she told me that she feels like everything is coming from her side she is understanding tough so she said that we will take our timeit isnt like i dont want to kiss her but i just cant make the move id like some advice on both parts even tho she is very considering and told me that it is fine i dont want to lose her over this,post-pandemic

after decades of different types of friendship theres no one that can hold you up everyday if someone were to offer help and you let it spill a bit they either look at you differently forever or go on with their lives and leave you feeling empty since you said too much if they stick around theyll eventually leave when you go on a downwards spiral maintaining optimal friendship means enduring it on your own this post is my promise to keep my daily suicidal thoughts and crying to myself until i die one day,post-pandemic

this is me dont get me wrong its better than dontleavemybedforaweek depression i am grateful i can be an independent person but there is something uniquely horrible about being able to go to work every day occasionally clean up after yourself pay your bills generally put yourself together enough to look like a human being but thats it nothing else no social life no hobbies constantly battling your mind and being absolutely fucking exhausted all the time,pre-pandemic
this is just a dumb vent ive had depersonalization for almost 2 years due to a traumatic event i dropped out of school lost all of my friends i stay at home nearly everyday and going out causes me anxiety i feel like i have no purpose i feel stupid i just lay in bed all day and isolate im always fucking depressed and the fact that my parents blame me for my trauma is making it worse for context i was pressured into having sex with an old friend of mine said friend got me dependant on wees and i theres not a day i havent consumed weed in one way or another to forgetthis friend had also went around saying that i had sexually assaulted them when in fact i didnt want to have sex with them i lost everyone i had and my fear of abandonment made it worse my mom brings up constantly when i say im hurting a situation that happened when i was younger than 10 my cousin had taught me about sex i didnt know what it was at the time and she had made me do some things that were uncomfortable and i dont want to remember her and i still talk and we were kids when this happened so it is past us and we are good friends however when i was young i had told my parents that she had assaulted me because my young self didnt have the vocabulary to explain what was happening therefore my mom always compares me to the person who ruined my fucking life and it hurts me so much it hurts so much that i just dont know what to do anymore my life seems pointless and im scared that i might hurt myself soon everyday i try so hard not to self harm ive been clean for 9 months but theres not a day where i dont think about my old friend and its tempting to relapse despite my mom having a psychology degree she lacks empathy for me in any way she and my father have always pushed me away as a child and made me feel unloved ever since i can remember i was depressed and life doesnt feel worth it anymore yet i have a boyfriend who cares my grandma cares online friends i just dont know what to doim trying to get my ged but every time i study i break down because i feel stupid and dumb im stupid and the only smart thing i can ever do is killing myself,post-pandemic
i used to be a conspiracy user not of the crazy kind of stuff but normal news and stuff that everyone questioned i was grouped into a herd that was made fun of and eventually my real name came out this got me fired from my job thanks topmindsofreddit ive been homeless bc i questioned the vaccine spam one time on that forum ruined my life,pre-pandemic

ive been in a loving relationship for almost 2 months she loves me and everything about me despite me being a depressed sad sack all the time she sees a way different me last night i had a dream about someone i dated super briefly back in january someone i was more physically attracted to in this dream we were making out and doing other stuff that brief relationship was more physical less talking and more physical stuff this new one is actually deep and meaningful its hard for me to handle for years ive been a serialdating scumbag hopping from girlfriend to girlfriend my current girlfriend is aware of this and still accepts and loves me so why oh why am i still thinking about past girlfriends i feel like such a jerk the ones from the past still lingering in my mind and the voice in my head telling me how those were better times what the hell is wrong with me,post-pandemic
tw im 20f at around 5 years of age i was raped by a close relative of mines i was also pressured to do sexual acts by others when youre that young you usually dont realise how wrong these things are it wasnt until i was a bit older that i learnt how messed up it all was unfortunately that wasnt the end of it at age 12ish i was also molested by a family friend ive never told anyone until now due to the fact that theres no one out there that i know who would truly understand im too ashamed to share during my school years i had extreme body issues i still do i was overweight and never liked how i looked i was constantly picked on by boys i never was pretty or skinny like all the other girls i would laugh along when jokes were thrown at me but deep inside i was hurt unfortunately the jokes didnt stop at school my looks were also criticised at home too my parents were abusive verbally and physically towards me especially during my adolescence i would get bad beatings sometimes thrown on the ground until my nose bled hair pulled slapped scratched and punched you name it and then a few minutes later i would be hit with the we only do it because we love you this cycle of torment really messes your head up ive been critically depressed from as young as i can remember a few years back a close cousin of mine unalived herself i remember my mother was on the phone with my auntie comforting her and then she said to me you can always open up to me how ironic considering the fact that i did open up to her a few years before that when i first opened up to my parents and told them how i was suffering from severe depression instead of comfort i was ridiculed and yelled at all because i was feeling the way i was feeling i got into an argument with my parents yesterday and as per usual i was yelled at and beaten i am currently laying on my bed ive been in my room since the altercation and i havent eaten at all its 1134pm here and im thinking about my life i feel hopeless im tired mentally emotionally physically even spiritually i just dont have anymore strength in me ive been wronged so many times in my life im so close to ending it but truthfully im too scared ive been crying nonstop theres nothing else for me in this world i wished i was loved genuinely,post-pandemic
ive been scouring the internet just go find someone to hang out with i may not be the prettiest in the bunch but i can hold a good conversation and i have lots of stories to tell my life has been hard like a lot my cup is already overflowing i know i shouldnt be getting into strangers car but if they will help me escape my life even for just a few seconds i will be so happy im honestly just waiting for a moment to just be gone completely im so tired already,post-pandemic
decided to post this as i believe you all deserve to get better this can help you if you put in the effort no matter how hard it gets little background lost my dad grandpa and uncle all in 3 months turned to alcohol to feel better started isolating myself cut everyone off even family didnt leave the house dropped out of college and wanted to kill myself as life wasnt worth living for me anymore at the time got stuck in a dark hole of suicidal thoughts substance abuse rage and severe social anxiety how i got better first things first the alcohol had to go any substance including caffeine weed and cigarettes have to go i quit caffeine and alcohol cold turkey do not recommend tapering down is easier and has a higher rate of success however i was kinda still am an all or nothing person i was either gonna give 110 or kill myself when i grew the balls to do so decided to try one last time to get better i signed up at my local gym now you dont have to go 4 times a week but id recommend a minimum of 3 times a week lifting cardio lift for 45 minutes do cardio for 45 minutes for me personally cardio helps the most i hated it but started to love it after i found out how it made me feel i love lifting so that was the easy part i followed an upperbodylowerbody split 4 times a week made it myself with great results bodyfat went from 17 to 10 in those 6 months was cutting calories on a small deficit if you are overweight make that your number 1 priority lose the excess weight you have no excuse not to most importantly just move walking riding your bike swimming it doesnt matter humans are designed to move selfcare take care of your facial body hair get a fresh haircut as often as you need get rid of old baggy clothes who dont do you any good get a nice deodorant shampoo and bodywash brush your teeth morning and night cut your nails both hands and feet learn how to pluck your eyebrows mostly the area between your two eyebrows dont touch the rest pluck your nosehairs just take care of yourself man look your best i know its hard and you dont want to do it but still force yourself in my head i felt like i wanted to do all of this but it was still extremely hard to actually do it but when i did it i felt better about myself workget a job if you dont have one get a job any kind of job that forces you to get out there and communicate with other people it will be hard at first you might want to cry and just not go whats the point but you have to make yourself do it family reach out to familymembers who 1 you know love you 2 who have always been there for you 3 who have never judged you no matter how bad you were talk to them about anything get out of your head and put it out there it is a relieve the same applies to friends reach out to friends who you know will support you sleep schedule sleep before midnight wake up before 10 am and get out of bed this is crucial force yourself to get out of your bed take a walk shower drink a cup of coffee with a familymember it doesnt matter what you do just get out of your bed and out of your room diet 1 word keto amazing first week maybe 2 are a little hard but after that you feel great your energy levels are stable you feel more motivated to do things and youll lose weight if you track your calories and eat in a deficit hobbys find something you love and start doing it for me it was fitness i loved it and started spending 2 hours at the gym 4 times a week also walked my dogs a lot started reading and played videogames with my brother most importantly remember that you only get once chance at life you can decide to dwell in self pity and live the rest of your life feeling like shit goodluck if thats what you are gonna do because life is long might as well try and make it a fun experience it wont be easy but it will be worth it being happy is worth it you just have to decide if you want to do everything in your power to feel happy again remember that you wake up every single day deciding either to hate yourself and not do anything about it or hate yourself but working on a better you it will pay off in the end you just gotta have the balls to do it and not everyone can be strong live for yourself stop feeling sorry for yourself and start doing something break that mental barrier,pre-pandemic

am i only one that feels this way along with all the symptoms of depression the one that i find the least common is the lack of willingness and ability to do anything i hate it when i know i have uni work i hate it when i have to do with the family somewhere i hate it when i have to iron clothes i cant study i can never do my laundry in time etc its not coming from a standpoint of oh i preferrr not to do workkkk today just work in general is painful to me it can ruin my day just hearing that i have any task to complete many depressed people are still having fun going to work doing chores etc but it feels like death to me,post-pandemic

around 13 months ago after a few attempts and a two year struggle i sought help and from there i was put on medication this helped me dramatically and i strongly recommend anyone suffering from depression to seek help through medicine or therapy i got through my final high school exams quite nicely and after exams i had a four month break until i got into my university and there i naively thought i was cured university kicked in and i was reminded that despite improving i wasnt cured as i thought i was i was probably deluding myself avoiding the topic of depression or suicide and i even felt strangely about listening to music which i listened to before my treatment and i stopped listening to those artists i had basically just removed myself as far away as possible from the topic of depression and the only reminder of it for me was the monthly visits to the doctor for my medicine over the two months i had come to the realisation im not cured nor am i not depressed i am still very much the same person and i currently find myself battling the same struggles as before albeit at a lesser intensity there isnt a great point about what ive said above but its just something i think was important for me to acknowledge naively avoiding my mental health problems under the guise of being cured wasnt healthy i am now taking steps to improve myself please enjoy your day reader itll work out,post-pandemic
actually i didnt just realize it its been all 20 of my hellish years on earth the worst part is that i have all the makings of a fulfilled happy person im incredibly smart get good grades at my university am decent looking and kind to others religious and i come from a good family yet the choices i have made have rendered my life a disaster i chose to go to a school in a different state and have almost no friends the friends i did have stopped caring about me and i dont blame them theres a cloud of sadness that follows me that makes me suck to be around i jack off to an incredibly addicting and degrading genre of porn even after going clean for 90 days on rnofap yesterday a pretty girl in my apartment knocked on my door asking if i wanted to hang out but i sent her away because i didnt want her to know how big of a loser i was i always act like a bitch never able to ignore negative thoughts my internship fucking sucks and it doesnt utilize my intellectual capacity but i stick it out because i am lazy and unmotivated so i just get shit on by all the douche bag people there my brother who looks and sounds like me has a great job hot girlfriend and all the confidence in the world yet here i am wanting to kill myself im constantly irritated lonely and tired of dragging myself through every shitty fucking day,pre-pandemic
let me just say that i dont want to commit suicide i just dont understand why people even want to live a long lifelets say beyond 40 or sth and why they want to have familiesdate or even why they want to have friends i have friendsnever dated and never will and i have hobbies that are only consuming art from various mediums but its not like i want anything else but i just dont get why people want to live for example if i died aside from the pain most likely i wouldnt care and i dont care about others dying eitherhell if my parents die i wouldnt feel anything obviously i would keep those thoughts to myself if someone close to someone dies because i dont see any point in being an asshole either but i just wouldnt understand it is it that i am depressed or anything else the reason that i dont understand it,post-pandemic
valentines day is like herpes just when you think its gone for good it rears its ugly head once more no wonder some people prefer to call it vd yes its that special time of year when chocolate manufacturers and greetings card companies encourage you to demonstrate the extent of your fondness in cold hard cash or the satincovered equivalent on february 14th fuck that this year celebrate or commiserate by sending an antivalentine stick two fingers or one if youre that way culturally inclined at any organisation with a vested interest which prescribes how and when to show your feelings this year dont say it with flowers say it with bile,pre-pandemic

i dont have anyone to talk about my feelings with so here i am sorry if there are mistakes in my writing english is not my first language i feel like my faith is to be an extension of someone else and to be unhappy the past few years ive been living life by doing things for others ive been setting myself aside just to make others happy disregarding myself completely being considerate and helpful to others is a good thing ofcourse but i completely lost myself in the process it has been eating me up ill first talk about my childhood i have asian parents that had an arranged marriage i realised that they had children just because of societal expectations they dont love each other my childhood wasnt great my parents were fighting a lot as we had a lot of problems with money my mom was usually at home to take care of me and my sibling however it still felt like she wasnt present she also physically abused us growing up i wasnt allowed to do activities that i genuinely liked it had to be something that my mom approved of these were usually things that she could show off to her friends i always wanted to take care of my others because of our financial situation i felt like it was my responsibility to make their life more comfortable i rarely saw my dad because of work he was my dad but he wasnt present i always felt bad for him because of how many hours he had to work he didnt have a high paying job during middle school we found out that my little brother has autism this was extremely hard for my mom as its something that was rarely talked about in our culture id say that its a taboo she felt extremely shameful and kept it a secret from everybody my parents and sister dont really care about him i promised myself to take care of him for the rest of my life even if i have to give up on my own happiness in high school i tried to make my parents proud by getting good grades i was an overachiever it felt good to get compliments and validation from my mother as years passed i started to struggle more with school my grades started to drop and i was comparing myself to my classmates this was also the time that i started to get social anxiety it was overall a bad period during my life im now an young adult struggling with uni and life im forced to help my parents with work and barely have free time i hate the fact that i wasted my teenage years i have never had a boyfriend im jealous of people that never have to worry about money im jealous of people that have regular parents im jealous of people without insecurities im jealous of people that have a loving environment im jealous of people that have no worries im jealous of people that can live their life ive simply lost hope for myself i try to tell myself that it isnt that bad but its not working anymore im not okay and have been living in survival mode for all these years the reason that im still alive is simply because of my brother therapy hasnt been working as im too self aware ive set a deadline for myself if i cant get better by then i will end this misfortune for good will it be okay to be selfish for once,post-pandemic

in my hardest moments of depression the thought monster convinces me that im worthless but that other people still have worth i also happen to be convinced that people are either lucky or unlucky and that theres really nothing we have any real control over because of this i can even see the people who do the most atrocious things as forgivable but with myself nothing is good enough every decision i make seems to be not good enough not worth enough to justify ongoing existence are there any things you do that work to remind yourself that thoughts do not necessarily equal truth,pre-pandemic

why is this subreddit such a horrid and negative place instead of a support group for each other i get if youre here you are depressed but every single post is extremely negative and frankly thats not supporting each other and especially not yourself in a positive way i understand it is important to express how you really feel but all i ever see any time i come here are post about how somebody will kill themselves tomorrow or how shit things are for them i know i initially came to this subreddit looking for support and being able to relate with others on a shared struggle and im sure many other do the same this subreddit could be a great place for the world and instead its just a pit of self despair and cynicism,pre-pandemic

hi rdepression my 39f spouse has battled depression for most of her life and it has slowly gotten worse over time shes been in weekly therapy her entire life and has been seeing a therapist that she likes and trusts weekly or sometimes twiceweekly for the past 4 years she went a long time unmedicated and only a few years ago went on a popular ssri for the first time that was prescribed by her pcm its worked pretty well to stabilize her and give her that buffer to make the lows less low but over time shes still getting worse what she wants and i agree is to see a psychiatrist to get onto an actual medically endorsed path to improve her situation and control her ssri while were grateful we got her on an ssri and it has made a difference i think its kind of crazy that we can mess with her brain chemistry by just getting a script from someone completely unqualified and without an actual medical program or systematic profile to give her an onramp to improvement here just take these pills youll feel better is kind of how it seems to be treated heres the issue our pcm retired and its not a 6mo wait to see a new pcm just for an introductory meeting we need the intro meeting in order to get a referral to a psychiatrist what are our options to shortcircuit this process a little bit should we just offer to pay cash out of pocket just to get an initial consult with a psychiatrist i feel like her situation has gotten a lot worse recently and dont want to wait another 6mo just to see a pcm just to get a referral to go onto another waitlist for a psychiatrist for 612mo from nowit could literally be years before she sees someone granted part of this is our fault we should have tried to get the referral in while we still had a pcm for her previously looking for advice on getting her to a psychiatrist as quickly as possible tia,post-pandemic

so my therapist that ive only seen two times thinks im not a good candidate for therapy she thinks that im too depressed for it despite being on heavy medications that im going to see a doctor about and reevaluate in a few weeks she didnt think that a combination of psychotherapy and medications combined would work for me instead she suggested ect treatment after only talking for 80 minutes total after doing extensive research this is only offered after you have tried a combination of both therapy and meds and have psychotic symptoms and have a high risk for suicide all of which i dont have i am severely depressed but my life is incredibly stable for the first time in my life i know how to handle my depression and my anxiety and do so very well which she agreed on mind you but she still thinks im too depressed and shes afraid therapy might make it worse ive done cbt before only for my anxiety so i am well aware it might get much worse before it gets better yet the cbt was very successful and no matter how hard it got and how badly i wanted to quit i still showed up for every single appointment and did every homework i got i am not a quitter nor will i ever be all i want is some help to get better without frying my brain is that too much to ask for am i unreasonable for thinking that psychotherapy and trauma therapy might be a good place to start just needed to rant and vent a little so if anyone actually read this far thank you,post-pandemic

im 35 deaf and have been struggling with depression for a long time i find it really difficult to muster up motivation to clean my house sometimes living alone i convince myself that i dont really need to keep it tidy but deep down i know thats not true however i just cant seem to get myself to do it every time i make a bit of progress the house gets dirty again so quickly i never learned to be organized or clean growing up as my dad and older sister took care of everything around the house i feel like i missed out on that education and have become lazy as a result ive tried using scheduling apps with notifications for tasks but nothing seems to work im starting to lose hope does anyone have any advice or tips on how to get motivated to clean and maintain a tidy living space especially when struggling with depression,post-pandemic
ive been suffering from depression for more than 15 years and recently for many reasons it gets worse in the year of 2017 my parents asked me to get a masters degree since my previous education was too bad i successfully got enrolled but due to my mental health condition and my social phobia i feel its really hard for me to keep going especially when i compare myself to other rich and happy schoolmates i feel no motivation and no willing to focus on my study i like it but its all because of my family wanted it not me i then realized that i havent done anything for my own good i just fulfill other peoples wish all the time this realization makes me frustrated and feeling hopeless and meaningless so im being suicidal for some months i talked to my mom last month i said if i could quit because i want to restart my own life and try to enjoy i know i mess up my 31 year long life already since i dont have a goal i am just being alive as my parents best obedient kid i see no future no meaning in my life so i want to give up i feel so excited when thinking about death a relief and a method to solve all the pains i talked about these feelings with my mom and dad i hope they can be understanding and supportive but they said no i cant quit before i finish my school also they said if i want to die its better to finish my school first then i can die with a certificate that at least makes them feel good that i did a thing i really want to die as a revenge to them they dont care about me and my problem they said if i die itll be a huge loss and shame for them because their peers would really look down to them but now they seem to know that my depression isnt a made up excuse so they tried to negotiate with me they literally said that i can kill myself if i could at least get the certificate i really let them down all the time they said if i could try at least once i have no friends no relationship no one i could talk to with my problems but i dont think anything will help me out im just super suicidal i cry all day i want to end everything but i hate my moms sad face and crying,post-pandemic

hi ive posted this somewhere else but i think its relevant to this subreddit as well so i hope its not an issue im a 20 year old comp sci college student i speak english obviously 8 arabic and novice russian recently or maybe for like the past year i guess lve fell into a deep rabbit hole where ive pretty much lost myself a lot of it has to do with my religious beliefs and not feeling like i have a place to belong in or a purpose in life this prolonged phase has negatively impacted my life in various ways from my relationships to my physical health im 56 and used to be 145 ibs now im 105 for a long time i thought ld just be able to gain the weight back but ive accepted the fact that i wont at least not for a while because of my weight loss pretty much nothing in my closet fits me anymore i have to result to pinning stuff and even then everything is too baggy i was hoping to get a whole new wardrobe especially since im trying to find my purpose again which includes attempts to attend professional events towards my interests and major however that is difficult to do when none of my professional tops or dresses fit me anymore its out of my budget to go shopping but a friend of mine told me that shein is giving out free points to buy whatever youd like from their website as long as you refer enough people but lve pushed many people out of my life so i dont know enough people to be able to win the prize which is why im here i was hoping to see if i could get support from this community all youd need to do is click on this link i only have 10 hours left to win and i need to invite 25 people before that deadline i know its sketchy to open random peoples links so i get if people are reluctant to do so but even leaving kind words or advice in the comments would be appreciated,post-pandemic
ive only ever had one friend in my life ive tried to make more but people hate me ive gone to community events parties hobby shopsetc to meet people people just dont seem to click with me im seen as odd annoying weird to name a few things ive been called the only person i can call a friend is my wife and i still do not understand how that came along she just gave me a chance and looked at my oddities a little different earlier this year my wife discovered i have never had a birthday party i never really had any friends to have a party so i just never tried to have one she said that was an injustice and i should have a party and invite friends from facebook she decided to throw me a party a few weeks ago we planned it out for a month made all the decorations by hand hand cooked all the snacks and food even made our own party games to play sent out invitations to people on my facebook her friends we even got rsvps back it all seemed like my first birthday party would be fun i was hopeful coming up on the day then the day of the party happened we rushed to get it all finished before the party start and we were excited the party start time came and 30 minutes later no one was here no big problem everyone always comes to a party late 2 hours later still no one came i started to eat my snacks by myself we got various excuses throughout the night i got sick stuff has come up car isnt starting no babysitters my boss just called me in my wife went to bed early she was upset and mad i told her its ok i am strong outwardly for her i dont want her to feel bad no one likes me but i am being eaten up alive i am now in my 30s and i cant ever said ive had a true friend other than my wife of course im thankful she gave me a chance i dont know what is wrong with me or why i seem to be broken i never should have had this party because ever since then i just cant get it out of my head everyone time i would say outloud to my wife or family they would tell me dont say that plenty of people are your friends youre just being negative now my wife truly sees what i mean if i would have just told my wife no to the party she wouldnt have been upset and id still be ignoring the problem of me being friendless edit everyone thank you for all of the birthday wishes trying to get through replies and messages didnt expect this many messages thank you all again edit 2 i see a lot of messages telling me to be thankful for my wife i am very thankful for her she is the best thing that has ever happened in my life and im the best that ever happened in hers we have been through everything together even homelessness that being said i feel as if she isnt enough socially for me we are 2 different people and even though we share a lot of interests we do not share all of them sometimes it is nice to have other friends to share your other interests with too example she hates the show its always sunny in philadelphia she hates it to a point that if i watch it it should be on my pc with headphones so she doesnt need to hear it i do it because i can understand it frustrates her but i love the jokes so much and i see random stuff in the world and laugh because it reminds me of iasip but i have no one to share it with except the subreddit,pre-pandemic

my slob sister is 23 nearly seven years older than me she was homeschooled but shes a legal adult and can do whatever the heck she wants with her life yet she chooses not to instead she went to a community college a few states away for a year when she was nineteen then came back home and proceeded to do nothing with her life instead she literally sits on the computer in her room all day and only comes out to go on her computer more or eat then she complains about her half hour of online schoolwork which apparently makes her unable to do some of her chores then theres me i try to do everything right i get straight as in school participate in cheer and dance do chores everyday use youtuberlevel skin routines every morning spend all my money on clothes and makeup and go to the beach just so i can tan while my sister is basically the definition of a college aged kid with no life no skin routine no makeup never goes outside and has clothes that look like they could be found in the mens department yet i have no friends and none of my parents friends ever care about what im doing with my life just because im still in high school instead they ask me about what my sister is doing with her life when shes doing nothing everything is all about my lazy sister even though she doesnt even bother to get a job what i really dont understand is how i have to do the exact same amount of household chores when she does nothing with her life and i am constantly stressing about everything i need to get done plus im seven years younger the chores thing is really what my sister is 23 so why does she get to do nothing sorry had to get that off my chest i dont mean to sound like a brat but sometimes i just need to vent a little,pre-pandemic

well ill start off with that i work a job that keeps me away from home almost all year i love my job but i hate that i am not ever home for the last 6 months i have started to feel completely stuck and without any options at all to fix my current situation of being gone all the time also whenever im gone i get texts and messages from friends and family all having get togethers and saying oh you should be here cant wait until youre home so we can hang out but when im home nobody seems to have any time to do anything and i end up just spending that time at my house with my wife about 6 months ago these actions have started making me paranoid that nobody really wants to see me around and they cant wait until i leave to start doing fun things again my wife who i love very much has recently been acting in this same way and any time i try to call her just to talk she seems to be too busy and always about to go do whether that be go hang out with friends hang out with family go to an amusement park go to a movie i always seem to have poor timing and she seems to never want to talk to me when i express my displeasure with being gone all the time and tell her i want to quit and find a job that i can be at home she shuts me down and tells me that that is not an option ive been gone from home for 3 months straight now and that entire time my mind continually thinks up things on its own for no reason like having thoughts of my wife cheating on me thoughts that she doesnt even want me around thoughts that my friends really dont like me and dont want me around even though i know these things are not true my mind thinks them up anyway and i either get uncontrollably angry or bawl my eyes out for no reason these feelings drive me deeper and deeper into despair and im to the point now where i dont feel like i can talk to anyone about it so when im on the phone with anyone or texting with them i try and act like nothing is wrong i have lately started thinking about never going home again because of thinking that no one cares about having me around and while i dont quite yet feel like life isnt worth living i feel like suicidal thoughts are not too far into the future with this road im going down i really feel like i need help but i dont have an opportunity to do so at the moment im terrified of where i might be heading but see no way to stop it everyday is a horribly bad day and i feel like it will never get better,pre-pandemic
hello friends well more than once i have tended to feel sad because i feel and can be convinced that a very small percentage of humans know what we can call the truth perhaps they do know what it really means to be human or the reason why we are here perhaps but what i dont doubt is that they know so much more than we do about the universe our real past other beings so many things does anyone else think that perhaps the small percentage of people who control our world arent even human have you heard this theory that they make us suffer on purpose so that other entities can feed off our energy do you believe in this what other theories do you believe in please share them with me,post-pandemic

something is very wrong with me i feel like i should say something even if its anonymously through the interwebs im a 31 m with what most people would consider a relatively successful life i have a loving wife an amazing young daughter who is becoming a smart young lady very quickly and a new born we own a home and im on a decent salary if i were to look at it in an individual basis unfortunately for a family not so much recently ive been waking up with some really dark thoughts in my head the most common one is i dont want to wake up and i cant be bothered living this all stemmed from my inability to get a new higher paying job the pressure has really been on to me lately because my wife doesnt work to look after the newborn and i want her to have the option of not working ive been applying and always getting fucked at the 11th hour that could be losing the spot to an internal hire getting to last stage and not making it or even getting cucked by my own company its beginning to really make me question my ability to provide and in turn my own self worth i think what really got to me is i applied for an internal promotion and my team didnt even have the respect to tell me the result its been 9 weeks and i initially followed up but they said it was still under review that really made me feel quite shitty i feel like scum for even thinking like this because there are so many people down on their luck and in way worse situations yet i have the audacity to think this stuff everyday in the morning that feeling grows too which in some ways is the worst part of it all and im not sure what to do its also beginning to have an impact on my family and my mood swings really wildly from the smallest of things only to regret my actions later,post-pandemic
like seriously i just want to be pretty and beautiful i literally think about that all day long when people tell me im attractive or pretty i question whether they are telling the truth or not i seriously question why people talk or are nice to me i hate myself with a passion every time i look in the mirror i just see an ugly ass bitch staring back at me i just dont like myself at all i dont think any guy would ever like me seriously i just turned 23 and i have never been asked out kissed nothing i know people that are less attractive than i am and they have had many partners and even had sex with multiple people i was at my moms house and i went on her facebook account i messaged my sister and asked do you think my name is ugly she replied not at all wtf i have quit jobs before i even really gave them a chance because i didnt think i was good enough i had a retail job for a couple weeks but i just couldnt deal with being around a lot of people and i quit that job i have a cleaning job but i work completely alone so i dont talk to anyone i just listen to music or think about things i do like my job but i dont think many employers think too highly of cleanerscustodiansjanitors even though it really is honest work and a lot harder than people realize i have been in and out of college since i was 18 i dont know what i want to do i have thought about medical coding human resources or drug and alcohol counseling i just get bored of it and drop my classes after like a week i havent finished an entire semester of college since spring 2016 i know this is really long what do you suggest i do thanks,pre-pandemic
hi everywhere i go i see hate for the kind of person i am which is pretty much a cliche woke sjw feminist antiracist socialist and lgbt plus supporter i try to stay reasonable but its sometimes very hard when everybody is against you like i find it hard to decide if terms like diversity hire or token against actors of color is racist or not just googling doesnt help anymore since i only find articles that talk about how much woke is allegedly bullying people even though i feel ostracized the most maybe not from society as a whole but definately from online fandoms such as the comic community which blames the low sales on books on types like me ive been depressed for for about four years now because of this and when i try to talk to normal people offline they either dont understand or dont listen to me what can i do even the mainstream media seems to be against woke types now like its actually accepted to compare us to terrorist calling us woko haram like the terrorist group it would be funny if it wasnt also threatening we dont have a proper debate on this just propaganda from the right that seems to be accepted more and more by the mainstream thus the headline of what i am saying,post-pandemic

maybe this has been talked about in other posts but im new to reddit and for once wanted to be transparent about my brain does anyone else feel like your head is a fog or like your living a video game controlling all the moments and decisions but not emotionally attached the feeling of unmotivation detachment and numbness has only gotten worse im 21 now i notice myself making poor decisions due to lack of caring and foresight even though i know what the outcome will be sometimes even as far as not being able to think as if my brain is just a static tv i say sometimes to all of this because i have moments of feeling normal or even periods of time but it always leads back to that same empty hole i feel like my brain is broken like ive been missing out on how everyone else feels,pre-pandemic
i dont know where else to say this since ill most definitely be branded a freak right off that bat by a lot of people but because of this issue i feel i am completely hopeless this is the note i made to post here i hate being a human i would rather be any animal but this but most of all i would be canis lupus familiaris a dog this instinct is strong and i fear i will never live the life i was meant to i may never be happy locked forever in an endless struggle against my humanity i am not human inside i know this for sure my life would be complete if i could run on all fours and find my place in the world as a canine but i fear i will never reach anything near that i feel like giving up and spending all day in my room naked and cold and on all fours always eating only dog food out of a bowl i know it would not be right but i feel it is all i can do this is not the way a creature like me should live its just not its so bad that i i feel like i would rather commit suicide than continue to live having a human voice is the absolute worst feeling in the world nothing against being human but to me it feels like breathing chalk i dont know what to do anymore the dreams i used to have of being small and on all fours are gone and now i feel like i have nothing left im a bitch i should have been part of that litter and now i either have to do something drastic or give up all together edit i should ad that my greatest fear is that my problem is unsolvable and i will continue to live out the exceptionally long life of a human being with little to no consolation or accommodation whatsoever,pre-pandemic

a very large percentage of the serotonin in a persons brain is supplied by the stomach in order for the stomach to be able to supply the serotonin it needs to be backed by solid eating behaviours in particular gluten lactose large amounts of carbohydrates large amounts of processed foods in the absence of fruits vegetables and adequate water intake may in fact be the reason people are as he says today fat and stupid if you watch jps podcast with joe rogan you will find that jp and his daughter both suffered terrible depression and anxiety until they switched to a lions diet an exclusively meat diet over the next few months their mental health made a full recovery jps daughter suffered since a very young age with mental health issues and had hers resolved by a radical shift in her eating habits it would appear that inflammation induced by repeated and chronic ill eating habits or even foods that we are allergic too and eat unknowingly have a massive effect on the psyche personally i was experiencing a long battle with anxiety with some symptoms of depression including brain fog and the inability to express myself or cry which became completely manageable and normal slowly after i quit eating gluten do some research and take it upon yourselves to eat better in order to feel better its worth trying,pre-pandemic
ive been suffering with ptsd panic and dpdr for the last 18 months without rehashing too much of my story i had a lot of childhood trauma it caught up with me about a year and a half ago prior to then i was happy loving life traveling super social and fun after my breakdown with panic attacks my whole life has been turned upside down im fearful of everything constantly ruminating obsessing ive overcome my agoraphobia somewhat but i couldnt leave the house for a good 6 months and i still can only stay within about an hour of home i went from flying all over the world to being in a constant state of fear and numbness ive lost all ability to feel any emotions love anger sadness frustration hope all i can feel is numbness and fearful thoughts i havent had a panic attack in almost a year but i still fear them and that i may go crazy my body has gone completely numb i dont think i could panic even if i tried but that fear and worry is still there im sleeping an insane amount my body is just collapsing into my bed i dont feel tired its more so that i have literally 0 motivation or energy so sleeping is the only thing that gives me some relief the hardest part is that im having nightmares and very vivid dreams and in those dreams i can feel some emotion but they keep me awake in dreamland all night i dont really know what to do im a 31 year old guy who feels like im 95 i have no energy for anything or anyone i cant feel any emotions or connection im hopeless tired and have lost myself completely i was on lexapro for almost a year and was still having major intrusive thoughts and numbness i switched to zoloft about 3 months ago and its helped me not have any physical anxiety but has made me a zombie i dont even care about sex anymore i just feel like nothing is working ive been suffering for so long i dont even remember what its like to feel normal every day is a struggle i think to myself all the time how am i going to make it through today i work full time and do my best to socialize but theres no reward for anything no satisfaction or pleasure everything i do is out of survival not because i want to my life has become a painful chore not the exciting and beautiful life i used to have i cant even fathom whats happened to me and how to begin to heal talk therapy just makes me feel worse because its reinforcing that behavioral change isnt helping ive tried to live normally it doesnt change how i feel im numb and exhausted to the core of my soul,post-pandemic

for lack of better word though maybe im just some tyke in crisis over hyping their predicament if i may id like to tell my story to accompany my thoughts with i was born in the deep southern portions of the united states my mother being an immigrant from cuba what i could remember from my years in the swampish area were some of my happiest days my mother still a young women who had a child at the age of 18 was stricken by severe wanderlust traveling the world while i tagged along something im still a tad bitter about today as i envy others who have childhood friends as a result ive come to learn various cultures forced acceptance and became trilingual however my mother did teach me some irrational things things that despite my knowing better today i still cant rid of as if instinct the most ingrained teaching was the xenophobic attitude i was supposed to adopt to in my mothers defense keep myself safe as a younger child i was obviously naive outgoing and made friends on the fly as time went on and traveling became more frequent i grew jaded and noticed the futility of forming binds that would get broken afterwards thoughts not exactly snuffed out by said mothers preaches of how anything outside is bad and people out there mostly want to harm me of course this made me only rely on my mother my father not having been able to make it to the boat that carried mother off to the states this is another point i carry some venom with as this woman whom ive come to trust explicitly and totally began to beat me regularly until the age of roughly fourteen i grew terrified of her and to this day i dread being in her presence despite my growing significantly stronger than her to the point where a blow from her felt more like an aggravated childs thrash than an adults swing shortly after this age i caught my mother on the phone admitting to a friend that she was growing frustrated that i began to shrug off the abuse having grown too big to hit severely damaging my initial theory that she had stopped simply out of regret rather than frustration this is for lack of better term the endgame of those results and who i am as a person now is someone i am horridly dissatisfied with and i often dream of getting another chance at life only to be brought back down that i simply have what i have and it wont change retroactively as for the noticeable traits and what ive been trying to change distaste for the public in the sense that i very easily if not immediately hate complete strangers for trivial or sometimes no reason at all my smaller circle of friends jokingly refer to this as hating someone for daring to exist in the same dimension i find the joke amusing actually explosive temper is another trait im not fond of we have a friend who is mad often almost all the time really but hes inoffensive and seems to be only blowing off steam in a continuous nonviolent stream whereas i continuously muscle through things and roll with the punches and all the fuses blow leading to a short term but fairly surprising amount of rage this became worrisome to me when even said grouchy fellow was found trying his best to cool my jets trouble trusting sometimes in even my closest of few friends as sometimes im unsure if they truly enjoy my company or keep me out of pity as they are known bleeding hearts fear of being a burden as well as a rather poor opinion of myself is something i regularly deal with often afraid im dragging others down and feeling at the ready to dispose or detach myself from the group which at times puts others on edge i apparently have quite the sacrificial streak which has been said could be admirable were it not so vain i suppose this is more a rant than anything else and a way to feel like i put myself out there and lifted a load from my chest despite my frustration with life i have at least crossed suicide off as an option be it out of cowardice or discomfort as being only remembered as the stranger in the room if remembered at all im not really certain what to say beyond this and truly hope i didnt break any rules i only wanted to confide in you lovely droplets of rain kind enough to comfort but not close enough to harm if youve read through all this you have my unending gratitude in accepting this gibberish in your mind you people make the net and the world a better place,pre-pandemic

get better youre a beautiful strong woman and everything will turn out wonderfully if you just have patiencei can say that with less than six months until i turn 40 i feel no less depressed than the day i was hospitalized at age 12 for trying to kill myself via starvation i can say honestly that at that point i had absolutely no trauma in my life my parents did nothing but love and care for me i just so happen to have a depressed brainand the beginning of puberty allowed its awakening i was able to make it through high school because i went to a charter school specifically for kids with emotional disturbances but i only made it halfway through college before i had another fullfledged episode of depression and had to drop out i was walking out of classes because i needed to cry for no reason i still lived at home and about a year later my parents told me i need to work the only job i could do one that allowed me to come and go as i please and take time off when i needed it and still be able to support myself was stripping in the meantime i was violently raped by a friend of mine i couldntt deal with it so i just went to work the next day like nothing happened with a tampon up my ass so i wouldnt bleed everywhere supressed it as long as i could until again i woke up and decided i wanted to die began therapy a few years laterlast i saw he was happily married with children my fucking rapist got the life i wanted and never had while i was able to move out on my own thanks to dancing after 7 years i was vomiting before shifts and my boyfriend at the time had told me that he would never marry me as long as i was dancing so i decided i was mentally well enough to try school again and graduated one year later with my certification in personal training i spent a few years making minimum wage to build my experience and finally i got a fulltime gig with benefits all the while noticing that my boyfriend still didnt seem into marrying me it had been 6 yearshe finally told me we are not financially stable yet even tho he made over 100000 a yearbut alright turns out he was cheating on me with a goddamn stripclub bartender i googled his email because i had forgotten his amazon name and ended up finding a whole bunch of shit that devastated me his reaction was to first say i didnt think youd ever find that well use a different handle than the one you always use next time then to tell me that i needed to move out told him i didnt have the money to move out he said he would pay for the deposit but when i found a placehe couldnt produce it finally told me he didnt want me to leave after all we can work on this blah until six months later when he finally admittedafter 8 yearsthat he didnt want to marry me ever i just wasnt a good enough homemaker i finally asked for help from my one rich aunt got the deposit finally moved out while in the meantime i had been promoted to head pt and trainer for new staff despite the heartbreak at home i actually had a job with a prestigous title for me and an actual successful career i was making enough to pay rent and was on track for another raise until 2 weeks later when i was fired over the phone because one front desk worker said she heard me jerking off a client on an recumbent bike seriously never in one million years would i have ever even thought of doing such a thing but you knowshe was 18 and her boyfriend enjoyed his workouts with me that was enough for her to make sure i never worked there againi was never accused once of jerking someone off when i was a goddam stripper of course with no job and no income i was given one months notice to move out i found a cheap room and was able to get some work at an old colleagues new gym i didnt have a lot of hope for the future but i still had a little and then i got covid and almost died from it its been six months and im still too weak to walk let alone train too much brain fog to really do any sort of work and only have two weeks of unemployment that i had to fight for left i have no money and no job no man has ever decided i was worthy enough of marriage or having a family with my own body has become a shell of itself and the hypoxia from covid as well as the inflammation in my brain from it has made my depression 1000x worse i tell people i need help physically and mentally but all i have to do is say trump could have handled this betterand they basically tell me i should kill myself because saying mean things about trump hurts their feelings or theyre just so tired of the minimal restrictions that they freely admit they just dont care about me or my health anymore because you know people need indoor dining but they dont need me these are people who claim to love me saying these things this is my support system saying these things to me can anyone here honestly say if they were me they would still have hope that things will get better im not doing another 40 years of this and since covid didnt kill me though it came so close i was on oxygen for 6 daysim nearing the point where i just have to do it myself thanks for reading,post-pandemic
because i cannot bring myself to focus on things i could do normally before be it hobbies watching movies reading and so on all i feel is lying down all day and doing nothing edit mixed feelings with the responses ive been reading sucks to hear that i am not alone with experiencing this i just hope that some day some miracle might happen to our lives and bring back the spark we once lost,post-pandemic

i visited with a friend for a few hours it was fine nothing bad happened we chatted and ate lunch at a restaurant when i got home i was met with this horrible wave of sadness and hopelessness i just want to curl into a ball and disappear there was nothing stressful or difficult about this visit but my brain is acting like something horrible happened what the heck is wrong with me im trying to get my social life back on track after covid but this keeps happening,post-pandemic
ive had depression such a long time and i too feel like its too late to achieve anything meaningful with my life or even become the most basic description of what most people would consider a moderately successful adult im 39 working this grocery store job that literally cannot advance anywhere and it barely covers the bills but it does enough for me to live on my own which im grateful for that is a success i guess but ill be honest as well the job is fucking miserable all day customer service orientated for snobby rich healthobsessed and trendy people being stuck at this job its the best money i can find now literally makes me want to kill myself when i leave a shift there ive got a manager right now who hates me and if you know what constructive discharge means that is what seems to be happening at work so anyway i recently got hurt at work and typing at and using a computer at home like this is about the only thing ive been able to do for about two weeks now to interact with anyone i cant drive very much while hurt like this so it really sucks like i can barely manage to make a trip to the store for some basic shit i need i have to get completely whacked on medication which can be fun if you like it but i dont like it when it is involuntary to try to do anything physical around the house like i had to do this one thing or id get a fine and even then it is just so painful and hard to move it will probably be this way another couple weeks but maybe i can heal faster i dont know it seems like doctors where i am just will not prescribe pain medication anymore because there are too many people abusing it so now i cant get some pain meds when i legit need them which just reminds me of another stupid aspect of our society failing i really dont see much point in my living at all when i am just going through the motions of life but im miserable i can get by financially so far but i dont want to just get by while i feel shitty and useless and unable to advance myself i hate it and there is no point to living this way and theres several billion people living out this same lifestyle right now i dont know how so many people are ok with these pointless lives i guess they are happy enough with that i am not ok with it at all hurting my family is the only reason i am waiting or havent already gone through with it we dont get along so great right now but i would still never want to hurt them in that way i gotta add just to be honest and inclusive that i have anxiety as bad as i have depression its almost agoraphobic like it is actually becoming a fear of leaving my house for the million things that could go wrong being stuck here i am not happy but i guess i am safe i shouldnt have to live like this no one should thanks,pre-pandemic
i just saw a post where they were asking advice on how to kill themselfs to make it look like an accident and someone actually replied and gave them ideas this sub is extreamly toxic and honestly i need to delete it i wanted to keep it so i can potentially give advice to people having a rough time but i also have my own problems and reading extreamly toxic posts make me feel like shit this thread is a breeding ground for further depression and problems and is not a helpful place for people looking to manage their symptoms and problems its extreamly common to read a post asking for help and someone replys give up like fuck off,pre-pandemic
i was in a psych hospital for a week and got out on valentines day i decided to surprise my girlfriend and get her some flowers and come over to see her she basically greeted me with a go home and then i learned that while i was gone only 7 days my girlfriend who i thought was straight was cheating on me with a woman so all the progress i made in the hospital just went right out the door and now im back to square zero,post-pandemic
we follow whats right in our minds even when we know its wrong in our hearts for someone journeying in the path of self destruction we only empathize with those who know the pain struggle and heartache for when the day we triumph over this dark demon we will have a story to share and help the next soul that starts this path but if we crumble under its heavy shadow we will have nothing i can not stop its starvation for my soul not now it will suck every ounce of willpower i have until i am dried up used and there is nothing left but a corpse until i have to crawl through the streets crying wimpering and wishing i had followed my heart instead of my mind dont go dont leave me here with this demon alone with it it feeds on my regret and guilt and suffering but now that youre gone thats all i have is this pain until finally i give in to the weight of the demon that rests so comfortably on my back unfortunately it does not die along side with me though it mirly finds the next soul to drown i understand why you walked away i still love you and know it was all too much for you,pre-pandemic

every year its always something different a couple of months ago i quit a job that made me want to die i cried every day while i worked and if i ever talked about it people called me weak not once have i ever said i was a strong person i know for a fact everyone in my life would try to save me sometimes while im driving i imagine getting into a car accident the car is totaled im in the drivers seat with my seatbelt on covered in blood im unresponsive i was in a car accident a year ago maybe im not sure how long its been i survived completely unharmed it was my fault i was trying to change lanes and took my eyes off the road in front of me everyone in my family showed up to find me sitting on the side of the road my dad and step mom were first eventually my aunt and sister my mom and step dad too my dad hugged me while i cried its my fault i kept saying it was my fault i did this its always my fault everything thats happened up until this point is my fault everyone would come to my rescue and wonder why i feel so bad all the time this isnt what i imagined when i thought of my future i feel so trapped i want to be alone in my own space but ill never see it when i imagine myself dying i see people crying over me putting in the most amount of effort to tell me they care im not dying and no one cares about what i care about no one wants to make my dreams come true my dreams are so small it feels like im not asking for a lot but no one can make that happen for me oh but if you just cant get what you want is that really worth being so upset over yes my answer is yes im tired of living with 2 failed college degrees in my parents house single and in debt i want a home i dont care if its a small home a boyfriend my pets and a stable career i want to be stable i want to go to work without this suffocating anxiety i want a fucking career im going back to school this time in the medical field im gonna be all about school so i can pass with flying colors im gonna have a secure job that pays me enough to afford what i want i want to have a home i want a home for me,post-pandemic

people often say to take your mind off depression go do something play music focus on school etc but the issue is that these are all just blank substitutes that comes crashing down just as alcohol is a temporary fix although it is destructive using music exercise etc is just as pointless i work out and then i feel great and then afterwards i remember my situation and my life and i feel depressed again if its not resolved no amount of substitutes can help all these activities are are just temporary bandages on a wound that cant close edit wow i didnt expect this to get so many likes my first post with over 1k likes im happy to know that so many of you can relate with me in this way,pre-pandemic

hi all im just a day shy from my 28th birthday and i can say this is probably the lowest ive felt in my life ive only been feeling this way since october last year a string of things happened including getting demoted for a job at the company ive been at for 4 years and watching my friend who i introduced to the company get a promotion instead applying for two other roles only to be rejected from them ive felt pretty trash at my career for a few years now and cant really see any growth in it i just experience no joy in work and ive stopped putting in effort so i reenrolled into college part time in a different field last year but im barely passing probably because my heart isnt in it following all the rejections i feel like im stagnating mentally and physically like a pool thats had no fresh water for months i used to be happy active on the go loved learning and catching up with people but now im such a shell of my former self i sleep for so long i have no desire to do anything i watch reels for hours and barely want to reach out to friends to hang out one of the things im really worried about is scaring off my boyfriend weve been together for 2 years ldr and hes only just moved back and i have this crippling fear that he looks at me as lesser than now and loves me less because of the failures and dramatic change in personality when im with him things just feel awkward theres heaps of silence no real affection we say i love yous but it feels shallow he and everyone i see around me are kicking goals and growing in their careers life etc and i feel like ive been left behind i know therapy is likely what i need im going to get a referral to a psychologist soon but the waiting list is months is there anything i can do in the meantime that helps me to challenge these negative thoughts,post-pandemic
my depression has depression bro a lot of the time i doubt that i have a mental illness and blame myself for being incapable of doing normal things i feel empty all the time yeah i have a diagnosis yeah but i still manage to doubt myself anyways it almost feels like its normal to feel empty its strange when people tell me they can do their school work have a job and feel happy by second nature it seems like feeling this way is normal but i also feel like im alone in this its weird i tell myself things like this isnt because of the depression its because youre worthless and incapable of doing anything i tell myself that this is an excuse to sit in bed and do nothing but deep down i would give anything in the world to feel happiness i hope this isnt just me like deadass i dont know if im the only person who feels like this and if i am thats just gonna scare me,pre-pandemic
does anyone else feel like their mind isnt as sharp as it used to be back when i was a kid i was actually able to focus on things and had a pretty good memory now its like im on permanent autopilot i rarely ever take note of my surroundings or have clear inner monologue im always stuck in this halfawake state where i cant focus on multiple things at once and just kind of zone out so to speak i also tend to forget things really quickly for some reason it makes me feel like some useless braindead retard that cant even function normally or think basic thoughts its as if my cranium is rotting away or something im stuck with permanent brain fog and theres nothing i can do about it i take antidepressants and vitamin d pills i drink lots of water i eat healthy but nothing works i hate the fact that my brain will never work the same way again all because of depression its destroying my life and i cant take it anymore edit in case anyone is curious i dont do drugs or drink alcohol nor am i old im just a depressed 22 year old dude,post-pandemic
i kind of have everything i want in my life i just got into a college for my favourite program and im supposed to be happy and excited or whatever but i dont feel anything i actually feel kind o guilty because now my parents need to pay a fee so secure the seat i feel like i cant be positive no matter how much i try if this is how life goes on idk if i wanna live im really really trying im trying to keep myself active and busy but deep inside i just hate myself im so lonely and idk if thatll ever change i wanna run away somewhere and never come back,post-pandemic
im 16 17 in 6 months ive been talking to this girl for 2 years now i admired her from afar at the beginning then gradually got closer to her through small friend connections shes really beautiful and shes all ive ever wanted shes funny interesting intelligent and genuinely just a good person she loves to talk or yap as she says but only to people shes comfortable with a couple weeks ago she admitted having for feeling for me after i pulled away as i saw she was talking to some guy she left him due to her feelings for me she told me how she didnt mind if we continued to be friends aslong as i stayed present in her life i want nothing more than to be with her but i didnt want to push anything or rush it so i took it slow just giving her more attention we began to call and play xbox together such as minecraft today i pushed towards her saying that she confused me as recently she pulled away leaving me on delivered for hours whilst being online she said she wants to stay friends but in future she said she guesses we could try to be more than friends i have a gut feeling she kept me around as i am quite a funny person and i make her laugh and i listen to her lots she would often be talking to a guy whilst she apparently had feelings for me i have a suspicion that she only kept me around due to me being a good listener to her and she never actually wanted anything with me as i am not a very attractive person a 55610 imo this crushed me as all ive wanted for ages is her i cant continue to be friends with her as it will just hurt even more so im making the decision to leave her life ive been battling depression and suicidal thoughts for years now and this is just a huge kick in the balls im lost and have no idea where to go from here i understand its only a girl but for those 2 years due to having minimal friends and little attention from women having her as someone to talk to and have motivation to keep going from really helped but now her being gone really is going to impact my mental state i guess im just coming on here to vent and type down some feeling but any advice would be very helpful i guess,post-pandemic

i read this a lot here i dont want to kill myself i just wish i didnt exist i identify with that so much i just dont want to keep feeling like this anymore and for whatever reason that thought is amplified as im trying to sleep eg right now all i want is to simply not wake up tomorrow is that so much to ask for edit wow i did not expect to get so many responses when i wrote this yesterday although sad its still oddly comforting to know im not alone in feeling this way so thank you sincerely for sharing for those who offered helpful tidbits thank you also i hope that you all find peace one way or another just as i hope that i can too but lets face it chances are thats wont be tonight so here we go again,pre-pandemic

its that depression doesnt kill you desire to want to do things it doesnt kill your dreams and what you want in life it just stops you from doing them its like being in a cage and outside the bars you can see all the things you can do and want to do but the cage depression locks you in and stops you from getting at them and doing them i dunno but to me thats one of the worst things about it p,pre-pandemic

so most of you probably didnt even see my post before which is fine obviously but i just felt the need to put this update out for the ones who did 3 days ago i was so close to taking my own life i was going to jump off a bridge and end it all i was drunk so it made matters only worse as i sat there and thought to myself a voice came in my head this voice told me how this was the wrong thing to do that i have so much more going for me and i cant lose my life over some girl so here i am 3 days later the girl and i have discussed what our relationship is going to be like we are on a break as this is a time for me to focus and make myself happy my happiness cant be dependent on another person that is unhealthy ive started seeing a counselor and just doing more staying active i know in the end i can conquer these demons i would just like to say thank you to all of you who reached out to me that night i obviously didnt respond but knowing that a random stranger online cares enough about another stranger to make sure theyre okay well that is special to me thank you once again and i hope every one in this sub finds some sort of happiness in their life we all deserve it this is a disease just like diabetes and you should not be ashamed of it instead face it head on and say fuck you depression im better than you,pre-pandemic
even despite an official diagnosis i constantly think anytime i want to share my thoughts that im just desperately seeking attention and being dramatic for the sake of getting attention and reassurance from my loved ones it makes me feel guilty the moment i open my mouth to talk about how im feeling anyone else it makes it worse that every time i talk to my partner about it she always twists it into some underlying meaning that i dont want to be with her and i get livid that shes made it about her maybe i am just selfish and attentionseeking,pre-pandemic

start reading books not a lot of them but the good ones dont pay attention to what people are currently consuming as books read the big ones become friends with books instead of people people you see everyday make you depressive because they are unhappy themselves do not read interpretations or summaries or wikipedia read them directly from the source start reading philosophy nietzsche kierkegaard schopenhauer marx psychology itself freud jung good literature classics dostoevsky kafka camus and history actually nietzschedostoevskyfreud is a very good combination these will introduce you to the awful and depressive reality of life and the viciousness of the people at which point you will stop worrying about yourself see that world is in deep shit and really start thinking about the future of the humanity and therefore yourself actually your body itself is craving for this and you do not know it yet remember it is not about exercising good food or going out and having some friends these are good but are auxiliary depression is all about the conflict between the external reality and the internal picture of it your internal picture is skewed you tendpreferwant to think that life is not cruel at all the reality however is starkly different than that life is cruel people chop each others head off without even thinking even more so in america you know this however at a subconscious level you subconsciously know that people are not like you good and childlike however you dont want to believe that yes it is not easy to accept i couldnt do it myself for over 4 years you have to reach to a new intellectual integrity and comprehendgrasp the external reality as it is if you cannot do it by reading books travel to a country where you can experience a different culture the point is to getting yourself out of the boundaries of capitalism stay there long enough to learn their language see how other kinds of worlds are possible see how people live in poverty and scarcity however how they are friendly happy and carefree remember you are from the western hemisphere and you guys are welcomed everywhere depressionanxiety is not a disease it is an invisible injury the societytimes you are living in is making you depressed you dont want to take it anymore because it looks like it is utterly meaningless to you it ceased to offer you anything however you have to fight you have to fight to change the society to something you want to live in you have to give society a new meaning and this is what the history is all about the history is the story of dissatisfiedcrushed people fighting to obtain their freedoms again,pre-pandemic

ive been dealing with some issues with my cat who is now 12 she is vomiting every day but a physical exam blood test and fecal exam revealed nothing at all whats more she shows no other sign of illness she still runs around jumps plays and seems to have a normal bathroom habit in all regards she is healthy for her age she doesnt puke a lot its a relatively small amount but its still daily i am currently trying other options with her like leaving out less food to see if she is maybe eating too much or too fast but this has also made me think about death at some point i am going to lose her and nothing i do can change that its heart wrenching to even think about and then it made me remember others ive lost two other cats my grandmother and my father and it hit me how faded they are in my daily thoughts oh i remember them all i can recall their names faces personalities but i am so angry and saddened how pushed back they are in my mind i dont want to be crying over their deaths every day or anything like that but i hate that i go weeks sometimes without sparing them a thought and im scared because i know it will only get worse as i get older it will come to a point where i cannot recall them perfectly and maybe come to a time when their memory is lost to me,post-pandemic
im stuck at home i have nothing to do i have no friends i have no reason to go outside all my family does is yell at me for the littlest things especially my mother my physical condition is worse than ever before every part of my body hurts as soon as i start to break down or cry i get yelled at even more i feel like im isolated in a place that might as well be hell i have nothing in my life that gives me even the tiniest bit of joy edit thank you guys so much for all the kind words and thank you to whoever gave this post gold i feel comforted knowing that there are people out there that can relate to my struggles it may seem hopeless now it certainly does feel that way for me but well get through this together love all of you,pre-pandemic
ive been a jehovahs witness all of my life while i do believe in all of the stuff they teach their rules and expectations are so high i wish i didnt believe this but i think being a jehovahs witness has made me depressed its mainly because you arent supposed to hang out with people who arent jehovahs witnesses although ive broken this rule before it was to hang out with my cousins friends my parents are divorced and im a teenager and i visit my dad who lives in the same small town as my cousin so i hang out with him a lot when i visit twice ive hung out with him and his friends and to be honest they were probably some of the best 2 nights ive had in my life so far because i wasnt being forced to hang out with someone outside of school and it was really the first actual time ive hung out with people that were in my age group that i liked and i know that its pathetic they werent really my friends i didnt know any of them and i had talked to only one of the girls there there and it was through texting i should also mention that my dad isnt a jehovahs witness and had no idea i was doing this since ive always been an outcast because of the restrictions of my religion have no friends outside of school because no one else in my congregation is anything like me because almost every one is very conservative and like most depressed kids i listen to screamo and watch anime so if i let anyone know that they would all think im a freak and probably not even want to look at me i have no social skills because i have dont really talk to anyone outside of school i just come home and try to stay in my room for as much time as i can i constantly fantasize about having a girlfriend not even making out or intercourse just having someone to love and hold who is like me if im not thinking about something my mind drifts into that dark place and every time it does i go a little bit farther in what i fear the most is that ill get stuck there eventually and then ill end it the worst part is that im too afraid to tell anyone the only person ive told is my mom and i lied to her eventually that it was just a phase and that i got over it i always look like im happy even though im far from it the worst thing is that im worried im bipolar i know it sounds stupid but some days im super happy without a care in the world then other days im super sad and ill i can think about is hurting people because im jealous of their happiness other time its not even that im jealous i dont know why but sometimes ill walk past some one and ill think i wonder what it would be like to shove a knife all the way through their head and popping their eyeballs and i hate it im disgusted by it but sometimes and i dont know why i just wonder what it would be like to just shoot someones head off and for some reason whenever i think about it theyre always begging me to stop to please dear god dont kill them but it cut them off mid sentence with a bullet any way sorry for the wall of text but i just really needed some where to vent,pre-pandemic
when i feel like shit or something bad happens my brain immediately goes man fuck this ill just die and apparently that isnt a normal response crazy shit,post-pandemic
but depression is much more than that its the excuses you have to make when you cant make that meeting its the friends and family youve lost because you cant explain why its the opportunities that land in everyone elses lap that they get to grasp with both hands while yours slip out of your grasp its the exhaustion that binds your body to your bed its the hatred and resentment you feel towards yourself towards the world for being the way it is its your proven truth that everything and everyone gets better except for you its the demon that dragged you down and trapped you in the hellish prison that is your own mind its the ball and chain locked around your neck choking the life out of you as you trudge through your marathon while everyone else gets to charge on ahead unimpeded its the wall that blocked you off from life its the leech that sucked out everything positive about your life and clouds your memories its not just being sad and we can only wish it was edited to add thank you all for the kind words and awards i really didnt expect this to blow up as much as it did i wrote this in an attempt to put my experience with depression into words and to serve as a reminder of what it feels like for the times when normal people try to tell me my depression isnt real or otherwise downplay it,pre-pandemic
i literally cannot remember a time in my life where i wasnt angry or unhappy with myself or how people treated me ive had body issues since i was 8 years old because my grandparents overfed me and let me eat sweets all day which led to me being outcasted by my peers and constantly criticised by my parents i first started thinking about suicide when i was maybe 12 or 13 and 10 years later i still think about it i dont think ive ever has a solid year of my life where ive thought that everything was going to be okay and life was worth living ive had months of temporary relief from the constant pain but thats all they were temporary i thought finding someone to spend my life with and who loves me unconditionally and puts up with my suicidal tantrums would fix me but it hasnt i thought effectively curing my disfiguring autoimmune disease would help me have a new lease on life but it hasnt i have lots of friends an attractive face and i had a job i liked no body in my personal life except for two people know that i struggle and the rest would never guess it i have nothing to be sad about really i have an objectively easy life but that doesnt matter i am depressed and i always will be i could have the perfect body my dream job have millions in my bank account and id still feel exhausted in the same way that people say once an addict always an addict ive come to believe the same thing about my depression,post-pandemic
im realizing more and more every day that im a terrible father i have a 3 year old son and we just had a second son last month ive worried before that im not a good figure for my son but now with 2 i think its become very clear that im actively not good for my sons i get angry so easy i wish i was the type of dad that was just cool calm and collective but instead every little thing my toddler does causes me to fly off the handle im begging him to stop throwing things while hes laughing at me im a fun dad either i feel like my son wants me to be more interactive than i am but im just not good at the pretend play stuff and i feel like im constantly letting him down his grandpa comes over and hes like jumping for joy at having a guy that will actually play with him its depressing and i know its not in my head because my wife is constantly correcting the things i do or the way i go about things my motherinlaw basically ignores me at this point and is more of a second parent than i am ive read so many parenting books trying to figure this dad thing out and i just feel like nothing works or nothing sticks im just not good at it a lot of days now i just try not to have too much interaction with my sons because i dont want to ruin them my oldest is so smart and so funny and i know he has so much potential to be great potential that i can only ruin i dont want him to be me i dont him to even accidentally pick up my traits so i just try to be a blank canvass and not do much with him i know thats not the answer but i just dont think there is any better one its just disheartening to want to be something so bad a good father and know that its likely never going to happen my wife is the reason my sons will be great im the reason they will have to go to therapy,post-pandemic
oftentimes depression feels like the mind trying to untangle a complicated knot in itself and putting the rest of life in pause to do that if the society didnt keep bumping its elbows with expectations if it was freed from the normal obligations regarding money social interactions etc the mind could work on the knot much better and the depression can turn out to actually be helpful to the person i think the mental hibernation is turned into a torturous depression only because of our poor understanding of it if in the future we made a society where a depressed person was given basic needs and left to themselves without stigma without social expectations and such the whole of society would benefit enormously from such folks im talking rbasicincome type dream society far in the future and perhaps just idealistic ive talked to a few other people suffering from depression who felt the same way that its not necessarily a disorder by itself but rather a state of mind that needs to be managed differently from the normal state and which can be beneficial to the person in the long run depression is a strange beast that takes different shapes in everyone though so how true does this sound in your own case,pre-pandemic
friday night the world is my oyster i have money i could literally do almost anything right now its even a long weekend i have friends who care who would hang out if i asked family why do i want to hide in my house i miss when i was younger i want to drink myself into oblivion but dont want to pay the price of hang over i want to go out and have fun but its so much work what am i going to do instead read a book play video games everything feels so hollow,post-pandemic
i have a depression nest my bedroom is disgusting i have a path from my door to my bed and thats just about it everywhere else i have piles of clothes and old food containers and boxes and crap i dont need i have a hoarding problem on top of being too depressed to clean my dad is a pack rat too so ive always spent my life in clutter i dont think its at tv show level but its still bad does anyone have tipsadvice for finally cleaning up ive been trying but honestly some days i pick up like 2 pieces of trash and toss a couple things in a laundry basket and i automatically feel drained i remember when my old roommate barged in to my room mistaking im coming for come in i was always so careful about keeping roommates out of my room always locking the door because i was never more embarrassed i saw the shock on her face as i rambled off reasons for the mess i just dumped everything in here when i moved in ive just been super busy with school and work has me exhausted i know she didnt buy it she must have thought i was the nastiest person alive she asked if i wanted help but i declined and said id handle it i never really did i can handle living in clutter its all ive ever really known i do wish i had a super cute and organized room but on the rare occasion i do try to organize everything it never lasts but i feel so guilty guilty because i have a dog hes been my best bud for the last 15 years or so and he doesnt deserve this life like i said weve always lived in a cluttered house but my room is the absolute worse he gets fresh food and water and i try to take him outside often so theres no accidents in here and he gets fresh air but he still does not deserve this i know he walks around my piles of crap just fine and still runs full speed to see me when i walk through the door his tail wagging so fast that his whole little body wiggles i know he loves me and i love him with my entire heart hes one of the only things that keep me going because im afraid of what would happen to him if i were gone i dont think my family would be the best caretakers and i saw how the poor guy grieved when my mom died i saw how he was confused and still went to her bedroom looking for her every single day for the longest time when wed pull up in the car hed race to the passenger door and wait for her to come out my family showed me how he kept finding his way into my room when i first left for college i wouldnt want to leave him hurt and confused like that so i keep pushing on but i cant let him keep living like this im disgusted and deeply disappointed in myself but ill do my best to clean my room and throw some stuff away it definitely will not be anywhere close to easy but i still want to try edit wow i did not expect to get such a huge response i basically passed out on my bed right after posting this but i only expected maybe 1 or 2 people to comment also a big thanks for the awards its been a difficult path ive been trying to clean for the past week or so and it feels like i havent made so much as a dent in the mess but i appreciate the kind words and motivation ill be reading through the comments and try to respond to as many as i possibly can,post-pandemic

if you give up you have no chance of getting out of the misery if you dont give up you may argue that you still have no chance of getting out of the misery sure but you cant prove this to me the sole way you can prove this to me is to continue doing the best you can even if you cant do a lot for a few more monthsyearsdecades until your life starts to fade way until you are oldsick and physically incapable of trying anymore yet you are still suffering by which point i will believe that you have never had any hope at all but you wouldnt feel any regret for having tried you wouldnt say it wouldve been more tolerable all this time if i didnt try because you are already dead but chances are if you dont give up that you dont fail miserably chances are you are eventually able to make something of your life even if its on the day before you die then you have made it you have won the battle against hopelessness chances are low sure but its higher than zero and you cant prove it otherwise so the statistically more logical choice is to not give up,post-pandemic
just hit 30 a few months ago and i have no direction in life i leeched off parentsguardians until they passed away when i was 25 didnt even finish the 9th grade and the only thing im good for is making excuses excuses are the only reason i havent just offd myself yet and i know theres no reason for me to be here because i have plenty of siblings that are doing just fine i honestly feel like i could of been skipped and my family would be just fine with my 2 younger brothers honestly if there was a painless suicidei would of taken it before i even hit 18 just venting,post-pandemic

hi everyone using a throwaway to avoid identification as i 19f write this im on the verge of tears and have a lump in my throat for no discernible reason before this i spent the whole day lying in the same spot watching tv save for the one time i got up to make myself instant noodles at dinner i started tearing up because i was disappointed with the food this is kinda embarrassing my mum keeps asking me why im always lying down not in a malicious way or anything and i cant really pinpoint the reason but im always unexplainably exhausted the good days are fine and sometimes really good but the bad days like today just really suck i feel like i am suspended in time and everything is in slow motion i have wasted yet another day for some context im in a transitional period in my life graduated from high school waiting to start college in october ive had some moments of euphoria here and there that made me feel at the top of the world got accepted to some really good schools etc however for the most part nothing really excites me this is a real low compared to my last 2 years of high school consistent high achiever top student for a bunch of subjects you get the gist during which i felt some degree of fulfilment because i kept getting told i was good at things i notice that when im not occupied by the hustle and bustle of school i always get like this more intensely than otherwise like during summer vacations another thing every single friend of mine has been motivated enough to get a job and do stuff that excites them ive barely done anything the only 2 things i managed to bring myself to do in the last 3 months were the result of me being talked into them by various people i am a major pushover so obviously i ended up doing them i just cannot bring myself to apply for a part time job because everyday i just go i am tired and ill do it another day i feel like shit because i dont know if i have a problem or if my problem is just that im lazy my head is really heavy as i write this so i apologize for my streamofconsciousness writing style the reason why im so confused is that when i am in social settings im really lively and fun im also a very typical gifted kid overachiever with much less to worry about that my friends who are on the edges of their seats trying to figure out what to do in the future and shit i have a loving family and supportive friends i am grateful for everything i have but i just get extremely blue and temperamental for no reason sometimes i dont dare to discuss this with anyone i know because nobody would expect this from me i dont know if this information helps but i typically feel like this during long holidays basically if people arent giving me responsibilities i cant bring myself to do anything im so sorry i dont have the ability to organise this coherently right now but could anyone share what depression can feel like or at least give me a reality check if i really am just lazy and melodramatic some clarity would be amazing please be as candid as possible because if it really just is an attitude problem at least i can stop being selfpitying and start doing something about it just a disclaimer i have never seriously considered suicide but from time to time i wonder what it would be like to just disappear dont worry about me being a danger to myself because i would never do it that was a really long post if you read to the end thank you edit ill be deleting this account soon but before that thank you everyone for the kind words advice and suggestions it means the world to me and im going to try to act on your advice 3 take care of yourselves,post-pandemic
to be clear i dont smoke often nor am i addicted in any way i will admit that i do sometimes give in to my urge to get stoned when im really depressed and while im trying to wait the 23 weeks to get the weed out of my system to be clean for a drug test for a job ill end up smoking because i get so depressed again then i get even more depressed because i smoked and now i have to wait even longer before i get a job but i feel better that i did smoke and it keeps me from going deeper in the downward spiral but im so broke now and ashamed that i cant even get a job just because i self medicate the obvious and most likely response im going to get is well stop smoking you dumbass and i definitely agree i need to stop but its just so hard sometimes i was about to get a job at this theater no drug test or anything and i was so excited and happy for once i could finally keep smoking and have a job winwin the manager told me hed call in two days so i could go do my paperwork i smoked with my friend to celebrate and everything was going well right i aced the interview they all seemed to like me hell fucking yeah its been a week since he told me hed call im not getting the job im going to have to wait another month to get the weed out of my system and another month of my parents berating me about how im such a failure because i cant get a job this isnt even considering how hard it is to get a job in the first place i just love how anyone can get shitfaced drunk and vomit everywhere in their cars while causing a scene and go to work the next day fine but if you smoke every once and awhile in the safety of your own home fuck you you disgusting criminal im going to stop smoking now until i have a steady job but its going to be miserable without medication oh well fuck me right,pre-pandemic

this is just something stupid i feel like im such a piece of shit and sometimes i wonder if im actually struggling with depression or if im just a piece of shit i dont get it im sitting in the washroom at my friends house right now and im thinking maybe its time i just took the whole bottle of pulls i have on my desk and call it a night were having a party that i thought i would be happy at i thought i would at least be able to shake the feeling that im stuck reliving the same cycle for just one night but its almost like tonight is the worst its been since the first night i cut im only 20 im getting help but what do you do when the help isnt working ive been taking the meds ive been seeing a therapist ive been trying so hard to get better but it feels like its one step forward and two steps back every day i think about it everyday now its been about 15 months i thought i would be over her but its dumb because i know that as much as i say i am im not i want to be but at the same time i dont im trying so hard to be someone i can be proud of and someone my family can be proud of but everyday im reminded when i see my scars that im weak and stuck and that i cant be that bad off but i feel trapped in a small room with shitty music and everyone trying to seem concerned but really i dont think they are then i think about suicide again i dont want to be here but i dont want to bother everyone with cleaning up my mess its hard and tiring and i know i shouldnt be feeling like this i dont deserve to be here i dont have the right to feel this its something stupid im sorry,pre-pandemic

cognitive behavioral therapy just in case youre not familiar second session today im big into psychology anyway even if im really down low theres neat stuff on the internet to take my mind off it and learn about my mind and how it works or doesnt but yeah ive been in a lull for years maybe over a decade ive got a really harsh inner critic that negative voice and left unchecked it just makes things worse dwelling on stuff that doesnt really matter or that i could find out or verify with a phone call but i dont because reasons on the other hand the critic helps when i need to learn and understand stuff its like a devils advocate when im engaged in a topic i really get a thorough understanding with the critical voice but thats got little to do with cbt thats more internal family systems but cbt is the life hack to counter the rampaging critic til things are going to be ok not something id say to myself previously and you know what today turned out ok story til that the registration on my car was expired since last month i found this out when i was getting in my car to head to the therapists office the apartment i dunno groundskeeping or parking enforcement or whomever stuck a sticker on the drivers window saying something like first warning your plates expired fix it or you get towed i did what any person in my situation would do check the plate cause i swore it was good for another year nope ok did somebody nab my sticker check the registration no its expired shit ive been driving around with expired tags for a month oblivious with no problems so i headed to therapy sitting white knuckle in the waiting room cause im thinking my car will get towed in the parking lot which is silly but i guess it could happen at least i thought so ill save you the whole session but needless to say things will be ok i headed out the nearest dmv the therapist was quite helpful in getting directions it was raining something mad and im not tootoo sure what im looking for and theres heavy enough traffic that i cant lollygag but not so heavy that im stationary half the time and would only miss it if i were blind i take surface streets home cause i bet money there would be a wreck on the highway still very much intending to renew my registration but it seemed like the deck was stacked against me things are going to be ok ok i make it home with no police behind me and i keep checking outside to make sure my cars not getting towed while i do a quick google to see what ill need for a long expired plate i dont have uptodate insurance either fuck not in my car or my apartment ok maybe the new packet or a bill is in my pobox a few miles away get back into my car which is still not towed small victories and head to the post office still raining traffic is slow and heavy hydroplane here hydroplane there i think my rear shocks are breaking get to the post office open my box nothing from my insurance company but a magazine i need proof of insurance i must do i even have insurance anymore get back into my car and flip through the magazine seeing if theres a support number no there isnt youre doomed is it in your phone no its not youre totally boned relax in my seat take a few deep breaths watch a police car roll slowly down the road in the rest of congestion changing posturebehavior is also cbt i wonder if my expired insurance information has the number check glove box and we have a number right on the first page and a separate one for incidents dial it up things are looking up automated prompt yes its voice enabled too so just a few voice commands and it turns out im still insured and theyve sent me an email that says yes you are insured great but its getting later and i only have an hour before i think the dmv closes i still dont know when it closes drive over to the college where im an alum so i can print the email cause who owns a printer anymore dont have my college id do i get it from home or hope the receptionist is nice lets bet on good yes she is and its a few minutes of messing about to get into the computer lab but im in rock on fuck yes making progress some of my friends are there but im rather distracted get the email up to print it wont print the connected printer is disconnected if that makes sense im in a queue i take a look at what printer its trying to send to its on another floor of the building it shouldnt be printing there its not anyway but thats beside the point ok its ok lets check the printer in this room seems ok its on and waiting ill restart it turned back on just fine its not the default thats still the one on the other floor and its not showing one with the room number like it should check all printers the computer can access pick random or the one that looks most like a printer and least like a document writer press print and just a few feet away the printer spins up with my document boss but now its half hour til i expect the place the close and im still driving around with an expired tag in heavy traffic in the rain its rush hour now nearest dmv is a few miles away sit in traffic roll along stop smoke a cigarette roll roll roll stop roll stop roll stop roll just goes on like that time ticking away i get to the dmv with about 15 minutes left i think walk in a few people sitting in the waiting chairs a couple of booths with folks standing at them i talk to the receptionist she asks what im here for and all i say is renew registration i get a number and sit down things are going to be ok but probably expensive my number is called wow that was quick i barely got to sit down the booth right in front of where i sat too wow i had the clerk my number and they ask what im there for i say renew registration and the clerk asks do you have your old one i fumble in my pockets but i did bring it im expecting something about being a month late and some fees nothing the clerk rings it up prints off a new card and sticker and says thatll be x x being much less than i paid to license the car in the first place i happen to have x dollars in my pocket and hand the bills over i was so excited i wanted to grab the registration and leave right there i paused and waited for change i didnt even need proof of insurance things are going to be ok hooray,pre-pandemic
because for me probably like for so many of us here it forces me to view my entire life as a waste of time i wouldnt even say im looking for help or reassurance with this post more just curious if this fomo is widespread ive devoted so much energy towards living the life found in college brochures tons of socialhobby clubs going out to bars and trying to dance with people attending lectures and keeping an eye out for local events whether because im interested in the event itself or because i feel like going would make me seem more interesting and i hate all of it i havent met a single person i enjoy spending time with even my academics make me miserable to top it all off when someone detects im pretending to have fun and calls me fake or disrespects me it stings for months afterwards because we know thats what life mostly is for us a choice between faking happinessconfidence or revealing just how negativepained we are and repelling all these people who want to have a good time,pre-pandemic

i have always been so passive with my mental health experts whatever advice they tell or oversimplification they make about my problems i just go with it because the last thing i need in my life is another place to have negative social interactions and walk out more depressed so afraid to tell them they are completely wrong and i listen to so much of the bullshit they tell me that it seems i am the one who should be paid for patiently hearing x200b however i smoked just a small little puff before my appointment and it made a big difference i confronted her with whatever i felt was a wrong judgement and now my confidence really made her unable to avoid my inqueries i was also so much more sincere and direct i used to sugarcoat my problems because otherwise the realization of how bad things were in my life brought me to the point of tears on spot no more oversensitivity or anxiety i came to the conclusion that having some friction with other people is completely normal and even necesary so they learn to have a high standard of you and not someone you can easily manipulate due to their low selfesteem x200b just a little detail at the end i stared at her similing for a good amount of time on one of those awkward silences she suddenly brought up that she was married and explained an experience with her husband to show me an example of applying cbt nice inuendo doc but that thc just makes me laugh it off x200b note attempt it with very small dosages cause otherwise your train of thought will get fucked i think there is a sweet spot to boost morale without clogging the thought process,pre-pandemic
its stupid but i always doubt the fact i have depression even after getting an official diagnosis im still scared that im just an attention whore taking up everyones time most of the time when i go to post something on here i end up deleting it because i dont want someone in the comments to say something like your not actually depressed your just a whiny teen i dont know edit hey so im not the only one who feels this way if anything its slightly comforting to know that edit 2 yes im aware of the spelling mistake in the title its kinda hard to spell correctly when youre rambling at 11 pm,pre-pandemic
also posted this in rrelationships but want your guys opinions as the title says ive been with my girlfriend 20f for 4 years and known each other for 7 years we decided very early to use the pill for birth control and it worked fine for several years when i was 18 the birth control failed and she got pregnant despite knowing that i did not want a child she went ahead with the pregnancy however had a miscarriage with this i insisted on changing birth control and we eventually came to the nuvaring which worked for a year before failing in 2016 when she got pregnant for the second time i made it incredibly clear throughout the whole pregnancy that i did not want the baby yet she still went ahead with it i am now living at her parents house feeling trapped with no way out i have resigned myself to living with her and my child and have given up on futher education i have no friends near her house and the only joy i have is going back home once or twice every month to spend time with any friends that i havent lost touch with i love my child but i feel like my entire life was stolen away from me by my girlfriend i want to get out of this situation but i feel like it is too difficult to get out of im forced to smile and act happy for the sake of my child but i am slowly dying inside as much as i love the child im not opposed to being seperated from it to get my life back on the other hand i feel like its easier for me to stay and not change anything despite how unhappy i am i also dont want the burden of child support for a child i had no say in but the main reason i havent done anything yet is wanting to keep the status quo i have no idea what to do throwaway because she knows my reddit account tldr girlfriend had my baby despite me consistently making it clear that i did not want it now i feel trapped and depressed and dont know what to do,pre-pandemic
i was planning to kill myself soon but i recently remembered that i have an appointment with my psychiatrist early next month so i thought maybe i should try taking meds since i have nothing to lose anyway im worried mostly about side effects for a long time and thats why ive never taken any meds for depression yet is it worth a shot,post-pandemic
im no bad person but i am sick of trying to go to bed every night because sleep is the only good thing in my life i am sick of working my ass off at the gym trying to improve my body with little to no results while other men were fed dinosaur milk in their childhood i am sick of having to wake up everyday and deal with my back pain and anxiety and shitty people all around me i know i may sound like a piece of shit but i hope there is a third world war and we all die for clarification i dont really wish people would die i just wish i would die in some sort of war,pre-pandemic
the tool my mind is a tool used for many things while the heart bends its will as i gaze upon the emptiness i know as myself i see sorrow i see the lack of me i hollow case that is using up precious space where others should be to love is to lose and i have lost myself im thinking of the end so its a beginning for someone else but why is it me that has too see this way in all the shades of grey and none of the color the bright lights go dim as my mind plucks away at useless feelings of attachment or longing i feel myself slipping and wanting to escape but i end up tripping on the way out like a empty meadow with nothing around i feel the bliss nature churn but the pain inside me seeps out the meadow turned to ash as if a fire ignited but what it was is my depression signing a deal with death it was the knowingness of happiness that could have been but it slipped away once again almost into an infinity that which is forged in death which my body and mind is all too familiar with the loss of someone close that turned my heart bitter so the touch isnt the same nor is the loss its bitter and no longer sweet the honey drop i saw was a temptation to feed on the happiness i thought would be never ending but it was only a glimpse at what it means to be so in the depressive state of this downward spiral the ash grows to embers as a rage engulfs the mind the crash to the ground leaves me weak and irreparable my body is shame and my life isnt there its moved on to a place where darkness is eternal a vessel of sadness known as myself sw,post-pandemic

i usually decline social events when im really depressed because who would want to be around a depressed person right so ill stay home by myself which makes me feel even more isolated and down but its not that i dont want to be around people i just dont want to pretend all night that im this other person i do that all day at work its exhausting but to have a good friend come over and just be there just sit with you while you watch tv it just makes me feel loved which helps chip away at the sadness just a little bit,pre-pandemic
my parents dont understand how i could be so lazy that i never want to heat up any of my food to make it taste better i just think the difference in taste isnt a big enough reward for the amount of effort it takes similarly grooming does not seem worth it at all unless i have to go somewhere and even then sometimes i just put a hat on and call it a day i just wish my brain would reward me with happy chemicals for getting shit done the way its supposed to because it feels like every day i just wake up and wait for the day to be over already,post-pandemic
i am having a lot of trouble with maintaining and keeping friends i am an individual with a slew of issues which are comorbid with depression such as bipolar and autism spectrum disorder that are contextually relevant for certain behaviors which is why i mention it anyways lately i have been feeling extremely low and have been going through a deep deep depressive phase it started getting to the point where i did not care about what anyone was saying to me and i started acting selfdestructive telling my close friends that i did not care about myself or my life anymore and i wanted to hurt myself i guess i became so detached that it didnt mean anything to me anymore most of these things said were during periods of drinking at a particular party last week i became incredibly drunk and intoxicated and i told my best friend that i felt like basically he doesnt care about me as much as i care about him and other similar stuff and said so much selfloathing stuff to him the night ended with me falling asleep in my other friends bed and throwing up all over myself i didnt remember any of it i could have choked in my sleep and even now i cant get myself to care this week both of my friends basically had talks with me which kind of were interventions they said stuff like if it keeps happening like this our friendship is going to be done i feel so out of control i cant even feel anything in regards to what theyre saying to me i just feel numb its almost like the only way i can actually feel is when im drunk or otherwise messed up but i cant tell them that i dont understand how this keeps happening i cant keep track of my own mind the way it works it makes me feel fucking weird and outofbody to look back on my behavior and i find it so difficult to change ive been to therapy once before and i am on the waiting list to see a new therapist the biggest problem i feel like is that i act out because i am afraid of losing my friends and i have massive abandonment issues i never had good friendships and i was in an abusive relationship for almost six years its really hard for me to accept that people can just decide to leave at any moment anyways i act out because of this fear but then the way i act will only repel people from me further it seems like an endless cycle thats so incredibly hard to break by myself i need support but i cant keep placing my emotional issues onto my friends its not their responsibility i just want to be happy and okay i guess i wonder how other people deal with these fears feelings realities anything helps because i keep losing friends over stuff like this it has happened about two or three times before that people have gotten sick of me due to my emotional state and it reignites my suicidal thoughts every single time any advice with having friends and being like this thank you,post-pandemic
currently unemployed and my mom died i had depression and issues before she died and now its even worse im at rockbottom with utter despair and extreme grief but unfortunately i cant kms and i still need money for bills worst thing is that all the depression despair grief and sadness shows up on my face so now ive got a resting bitch face sad face and hateful face i dont have the energy and willpower to fake it anymore or to even smile im worried i dont like being mean to people or be rude to people but im at such a low point in my life my unhappy despondent attitude and face are going to probably piss people off or make them hate me facetoface jobs look like a challenge for me right now customer service and retailfood service jobs are going to be hard too i honestly literally do not have anymore willpower to smile or socialize or pretend everything is okay im just dead inside now i want to work but i dont want to offend anyone what options do i have i wish i could just do mindless work that no one likes because its boring that way i wont bother or offend people with my despair and antisocial behavior i wish i could be as smart as some people who make money online or be lucky with a work from home position with minimal communication oh well whatever,post-pandemic

i dont know if these are just symptoms of depression but i feel so distant from people that i used to consider friends they never come in contact with me and i cant bring myself to contact them either and when i do its often just short lived conversations or i end up being left on read my main circle of friends kind of broke off and now they never seem to plan anything with me i feel so alone but at the same time it feels so hard to talk to people or even get out and try to meet others as for finding new friendships and relationships i feel like ive met someone but i find it so hard to trust them and i feel so scared all the time that its never going to work out or if theyre even interested i honestly feel like im not even a priority for them but i feel so guilty and selfabsorbed for feeling this way i dont know if i should tell them because it might make me feel clingy i dont know what to do and i feel hopeless edit thank you for gold hopefully our shared experiences can help our fellow brothers sisters and siblings get through these hard times,pre-pandemic
does anybody else feel like they are just there i feel like there is no depth to me i have no interests anymore everything feels like a chore i dont feel like a real person only a spectator i am here but not really i have no personality i pick up some traits i see in others or on tv i feel like i am just a mix of various people ive considered interesting and i just impersonate and mimic them i just live and do what others want me to do i feel like an empty shell i daydream all the time and sometimes feel like i am losing touch with reality sometimes i cant recall what my face looks like all i see are parts of it and it feels unfamiliar and uncomfortable i have no idea what is going on with me ive been growing more and more suicidal each day i just wish i could feel okay for a moment,post-pandemic
i should start this by stating i no longer get such a feeling anymore i always dissuaded depression as some false grab for attention boy was i wrong this overwhelming feeling of getting nothing done doing nothing and just wasting time had made me feel incredibly impotent i had even cried at one point which is something i hadnt done for years at that point and i pride myself as the fairly happypositive type it just felt like everything once comfortable was a waste of time and only worsened my mood showers felt long and drawn out making me drowsy i had stayed in my bed looking at my ceiling for hours but it seemed like minutes it came to the point where i tried to watch movies i had associated with happy golucky and even those didnt help in the slightest it felt forced almost contrived like an effort gone to waste or a carcrash in slow motion almost a feeling of self cringe i cannot offer any advice or help to anyone with depression only that i was fortunate enough that the feeling eventually disappeared i merely state this to anyone who has never felt it before it can happen to anyone and chances are if someone you know says theyre depressed they are most likely feeling the shittiest they have ever been and its best that you support them as best as you can sometimes it gets better like in my case sometimes it can last years i only hope those who are tolled with that kind of feeling have something worth living for,pre-pandemic

hello im a 20 year old guy and i have lots of issues within myself i have lots of features that arent desired by the opposite sex which are my height balding and my acne scars im not desperate to be in a relationship but im worried that no women will ever love me because of the way i look i think personality wise i have a really good eq because i know how hard times can be i always take small steps in appreciating the way i look but i get so teased so much about me balding that all of my selfesteem gets destroyed in this day and age social media plays a big part in peoples life and being attractive is such a big part im worried that because im not at the beauty standard that the world is in that i may never get into a relationship im really lonely and im fine with where i am today i still have a lot to learn but sometimes its hard when youre teased about the way your appearance is i just wished that i wasnt balding and that people stopped basing appearance as a way to get into a relationship,post-pandemic
there is a certain unique pain one goes through its a ruff pain hits right in the feelers and can honestly really do some mental damage as well i think its not talked about enough personally nothing hurts more than building a connection to someone and everything be going peachy and great and you literally watch person after person time after time just lose all interest in you completely just because of something you have no control over yourself worth goes way down i dont know if there is a more potent form of body shaming to be honest i mean if you have problems with weight you can generally fix that with the right motivation and drive and consistency with women if you have small breasts or a flat butt well at least you still have plenty of other defining features like your curvy legs and hips beautiful skin beautiful hair and facial structure and of course a vagina which is really hard to not be desired mens one defining feature is their dicks its been like that forever the world is not a nice place for people like that people are more forgiving to fucking serial killers than they are to a guy with a small dick having a small dick is an instant way to fuck your place up on the social ladder with everyone you know even people with secret small penises will dog you just to keep up the illusion socially so once thats found out its time to sign out bro youre done all that bullshit about size not mattering is just bullshit point blank girls want the biggest dick they can handle they arent going to comit to a dick less than worthy if they do its probably because shes a gold digger and shes fucking your brother when you go to work in your bed because girls have needs too cant even be mad at them about it for real you cant take a fucking rowboat across the ocean in a storm and expect to make it work nah you need a big black yaht on that mfer am i right all im trying to say is having a less than desirable dick is like a curse and there is no fixing it thats probably why people spew bullshit about size not mattering like they do like what do you tell someone better luck next time bud lol there is no good answer thats true so they lie theyre asses off because their good people and they feel bad and they want to be there for people going through it in a way and help them find happiness somehow when in reality you got a better chance of pelosi admitting shes a corrupt bitch who uses her position to benefit off the stock market for her and her family using info unavailable to the rest of everyone else it just cant happen it wont happen ask yourself this what is the biological purpose for living on this planet if you answered to mate and reproduce congrats when you cant reproduce because nobody wants to a commit to you and limit themselves unfairly totally understandable and b even if they did this puny fuggin thing probably doesnt have the length nor the psi to even get the shit up there deep enough to induce pregnancy to begin with that means ina biological sense your life has no meaning let me ask you something else what drives people to be the best they can be i mean honestly its sex and companionship thats what drives people to be better than others its like competition in the wild but instead of prey we compete over pussy what happens when you take pussy off the menu its kind of like getting a shit hand in blackjack you fold so not only does having a small penis have the very real potential to ruin your sex life but everything else will suffer from the giant hole a lack thereof creates its real hard to find motivation to deal with bullshit all the time when you have nobody to provide for and nothing to work towards other than your own survival edit after some time rereading this post i wanted to take the time to add a few things if your someone who feels my pain and you share a similar experience to what i described i just want to tell you personally to never ever give up i realize my words here are very sinical i realize the pain people like myself go through and i know im not alone in this world with this so despite everything i said and even though i stand by all of it i want to clarify to the people like me that i do not condone suicide in any way it should never come to that if your someone who struggles like me i know how hard times can get and im extending the invitation to even though we dont know each other reach out to me on my messages ill be there for you i dont even have to know your name i love people it may sound like i dont but i do im a lover nd if it ever comes down to it for any of you get in touch with me ill even give you my number so you can actually calla nd hear a human voice and have a meaningful conversation im not therapist im not offering help im offering a shoulder and im offing my support wherever possible we are people we need to look out for each other,post-pandemic

it isnt easy not everyone can do it but sometimes you can summon the courage to tell depression you hit like a bitch and then you fight back you start by fighting a little at a time get out of bed brush your teeth take a shower then maybe you can fight harder go to work go out with friends see family the hardest fights are yet to come resist the urges to stay complacent keep yourself alive live a life many of us can do it if we try but know that you dont have to fight alone,pre-pandemic
let me explain im a 22 year old female and ive learned so much recently my entire life ive been very naive and assumed everyone had good intentions i have adhd and i speak my mind and thought most people did that too i met a lot of men and women later who treated me very badly and i would always ignore it and blame myself i had a job working only with females and ive never been close to fake people that i knew of so a lot of bad situations happened they would talk badly about me behind my back excluding me making fun of me using me as a target looking back i metattracted those people because i had no boundaries didnt speak up selfblamed and had very low self esteem people always treated me badly because i let them i learned a lot about myself and got a lot of self awareness my point is people started telling me i had to understand that most people lie are fake and only act from selfishness and thats just how the average human brain works i get so disappointed in humanity if thats how most of the people in the world acts every time i met someone usually men i legitimately thought was nice they would end up being an asshole after a few months proving my point every time i now have to try to distant myself in my mind from the new people i meet because they always end up disappointing me i would attach myself way too quickly to people in the past legitimately caring for them and they never gave a shit about me if you think about how much awful shit humans have beenare capable of doing war torture etc its so scary are most humans just naturally bad people doing those extremely evil acts and more normalized behaviour like abuse harassment lying cheating manipulation etc is the really how the average brain works how am i supposed to navigate in a society with liars manipulators and fake people its very discouraging and sad its not possible that all of the people ive met coincidentally were the few bad ones ive gone from naive and unknowing to kind of cynical treat people they way you want to be treated is apparently outdated if youre kind and trusting youll get taking advantage of dont know if i formulated this good enough but i dont know what to do i dont want to go through life being disappointed again and again but i dont want to assume the worst in people either,post-pandemic

dont do anything and get used for sex by better looking men even depressed women get laid depressed men nope i wish i had this privilege its too bad feminists dont want real equality even if they dont have men going after them they have their sex toys that feel 95 as good as the real thing i have been told all this by women in my life,pre-pandemic
throwaway account naturally lol partially just wanna vent cause i have no one to do that with so im relying on internet strangers and perhaps just at my wits end on what to do im 17m finals in 3 months and studying to be a doctor but i feel very empty and alone not diagnosed with depression and dont know if i have it but i dont know how to describe this feeling firstly i just feel terrible about feeling this way since i live a very privileged life and have been able to go private school my whole life not to say my rough hasnt had rough patches ive been bullied for being fat and appearances out of my control my older brother has a learning disability my dad also got into trouble with loan sharks when i was around grade 3 so my parents had to always work and were rarely home worry about my safety and never really being able to make friends outside of school since i was always at home with my grandparents because of this i always feel like im behind having to sacrifice everything to work hard and catch up for things i could never develop naturally through experiences like talking in my mother tongue and understanding my own culture i cant go to anyone either my parents always argued when i was a kid both about finances and my brother so i always had to act as the mediator while its better now they still argue and blame each other if i confront them about problems and convey any sembelance of struggle its always matched with i have to work as well even though i feel ive spent so much of my life and decisions for the sake of them i disappeared last summer for an evening just contemplating suicide and i got joking remarks about how suicide and cutting are serious issues for teenagers nowadays they also have more financial freedom and time now after spending so much of their time and energy just so my brother and i could continue attending private and seeing how stressed they were before i feel like all my problems are my own to bear which im trying my damn best to but now i genuinely dont know how to cope with this feeling of complete emptiness and weight in my chest its not like i dont have friends i have my close group of friends and have a decent amount of acquaintances just from all the projects and activities i partake it ive helped a lot of them with their struggles but part of me just doesnt feel like i can depend on them they just feel like mates but not people who could give genuine insight on how i feel and ive tried all the coping mechanisms i was fat so i started playing sports cut my calories to 1800 a day and got abs and now go to the gym and do cardio 4x a week ive selftaught 2 instruments starting from old rusty few decade old handmedowns because my parents could never afford lessons and got involved in productions and activities i worked hard at academics because i was always the dumb kid and bottom of the class in tests and grades and now climbed my way to trying to become a doctor i had cystic acne and tried every treatment now on accutane for a few months and its getting better despite the scars from 4 years of severe acne i volunteer and try my best to help people and repay people and be grateful so why do i feel so empty i feel like ive done so much in this short time frame and all the things people say will help im only limited by things i cant control such as genetics and time despite this in the past 25 years ive had bouts of suicide but was always too scared but in the past 2 years theyve been coming back more frequent and more vivid and more appealing and that scares me i had my fourth genuine episode recently how do i cope with this emptiness loneliness and just absolute lack of selfworth its starting to impede my studies and social life i either cant focus or the relief is temporary from any of the activities i do above ive both not pursued girls who showed interest in me and rejected a girl because i was too busy and also scared theyd be disappointed in who i really was vs who they thought i was and how terrible of a boyfriend id be i started cutting myself recently because i couldnt focus in class and was shaking even though i never had thoughts about it before i dont want to turn to alcohol or drugs cause i know how devastating it can be on my life i think i do everything for myself and all my goals are genuine so why do i still feel like this and do all these things if you made it to the end genuinely thank you for reading it all for the record i dont want any sympathy of pity as harsh as that sounds id appreciate if you could give honest input even if its harsh or just something healthy i could try to get rid of this burden,post-pandemic
i cant stop crying why wont anyone help me please just help me please help me please help me,pre-pandemic
for the longest time ive been trying to understand how people can be depressed maybe its simply because any and all depressed people ive seen are people who claim to be depressed for the shallowest reasons imaginable but ive never really believed that people can be depressed my reasoning is something like this if youre reading this chances are you live better than 70 of the world so how can a person claim to be depressed you sure as hell have it better than about four billion others when you look at the majority of depression cases do you think theyve been in a situation where life is absolutely miserable where they dont have food or where violence is their life where disease runs rampant or any really lifethreatening situation where they realize that your life is god awful i just really dont understand how people can claim that their life is worse than anyone elses i spoke with someone earlier about the violence aspect and they pointed out a situation where violent rape occurred and because no one in the victims life could relate the pentup emotions became depression and sadness what i didnt understand is why cant someone channel those emotions elsewhere to something productive like becoming strong enough to prevent it from ever happening again tldr im probably coming off as an asshole but i dont understand how people can get depressed and i just would like to hear some scientific reasoning behind depression,pre-pandemic
i wrote a note on facebook the other day about my thoughts on suicide ive resolved to kill myself when my mom goes its okay im at peace with death i wanted to write down my beliefs before i go im pretty much a loser i never went to college i cant afford it my friends are abandoning me because ive mistreated them ive been forced to quit marijuana due to my own actions im a jerk i wrote this originally on facebook its okay i believe in god please excuse the typos i wrote this in notepad which has no spell check and im too lazy to reread this well as expected people reached out to me after my last note there were those who were explicit in their attempts to cheer up and those who implicitly just sent me a text out of the blue as if they didnt read it maybe they didnt who knows all i know is i appreciate them both i felt so bad the only thing on my mind was asking them if they knew where i could find some weed i didnt ask because im not one to impose i have a psychological addiction to weed i went from smoking a vaporizer every day to nothing at all the shock to my system has caused a chemical imbalance the last time i smoked was 2 weeks ago and the last time i smoked before that was another two weeks so i went from smoking every day to about once or twice a month im going through withdrawls ive been scrounging for the last half a year my main connection was a good friend of mine but we had a falling out and he doesnt talk to me anymore its my own fault i can be a bit of an asshole sometimes drugs have ruined my life ive done lots lsd mushrooms mescaline mdma not alot i have more fingers than the times ive done these drugs but they opened up my mind i learned there is a world out there that surrounds us all the time that is far greater than anything we can imagine im reminded of platos parable of the cave for those who dont know platos parable ill retell it here imagine a prisoner chained to a wall in a cave with a fire behind him he was chained here his entire life all he knows of the world are the shadows cast by the fire behind him thats all he experiences then imagine one day he wakes up and his chains are off he gets up and turns around he sees the fire it is an incredible sight then imagine he goes further and exits the cave and sees the world for the first time the world would be greater than anything he could ever imagine this parable or story was platos belief in a perfect world beyond our comprehension platos perfect world is comparable to heaven and indeed the story was picked up by later philosophers who had strong ties to christianity particularly the neoplatonists but i wont get into that the question at hand is does it exist ancient jewish beliefs say no this world we live in is already heaven for all intents and purposes this is it i personally have had stepped out of the cave and glimpsed the perfect world i had an experience on dmt where i completely disconnected i teleported to a perfect world and i was in a dank apartment the whole time i was indoors but it felt like i was outdoors it was fucked for a few moments i was outside the cave i took a heroic dose of dmt from a crack pipe before i could even put the pipe down i started traveling throughout the dimensions at first it was just random ass geometric patterns and shapes flying by inside and out but there was a point where everything just coalesced and i found my self sitting in a marble hall before a great alter upon which an incredibly colorful being laid with a hand on her elbow beckoning me over i stood up at the extreme edges of the room were marble pillars beyond which were the green tops of trees and birds flying by upon a cloudless blue sky for lack of a better word but problably the best word incredible i focused on the being of the center of the room she wasnt wearing any clothes but had no discernable features besides her face which itself looked statuesque i could make out a hairline eyes nose and a mouth but she was all one solid color like a mannequin except she was all colors she kept changing colors like oil upon water except much brighter and vivid i took a few steps closer and stammered youre real youre really real and that is when everything fell apart everything started zooming out at a million miles a second and the perfect picture shattered back into random ass geometric patterns and shapes soon the room came back to me and everything was in a flux flucuating between random ass geometric patterns and shapes and discernable objects my friend who was sitting next to me kept going back and forth between friend and random ass patterns and shapes along with the rest of the room and it kept fluxing back and forth until finally the random ass shapes finally my world stopped and i was back in my friends messy ass apartment i asked him what he saw he said i kept rocking back and forth saying im sorry and thank you over and over but for a moment i was there i saw the perfect idealized world what i learned is it surrounds us all the time its like a dream within a dream and it keeps on going in on itself forever and ever like an onion with infinite layers until finally you hit the ground and start to make sense of the infinite nonsense we probably wont be able to function as our current selves in this ideal world to go back to platos parable of the cave for a second we know what happens when someone is freed from the cave it is called environmental autism and can be read about on wikipedia there was a girl in florida who was confined to a closet her whole life then when she was like 7 or 8 i cant recall she was rescued and adopted by a kind family this girl has permenant learning disabilities and cannot speak it happens to us all imagine what your life would be like if it ended at birth you cant really no one remembers what life in the womb is like but experience tells us what it would be like you live in a perfect little world without a care and all of a sudden the pressure dropswater breaking and then suddenly increasescontraction and the pressure rapidly increases and decreases until you cant take it anymore and you fall outbirth you fall out screaming and crying because all you ever knew came to an abrupt end then the cord is cut and youre greeted by an eternally greatful benelovant beingmom its gonna keep happening rebirth and death when we die were just going to get shoved out into a new world with no idea how to act well have environmental autism unless were lucky and run into a benelovant being that shows us the ropes which brings us to god what is god in order for god to be perfect god would need to be unchanging so that means in each reincarnation god cannot change this means god is not a perceivable being were not going to meet god when we die even if we do encounter a benelovant being upon our expulsion from this worlddeath that being cannot be god that being would change upon meeting us as we didnt exist in its realm before our birthdeath it begs the question what is god god has to be the laws of the universe the rule that allows the other rules to exist we cannot perceive god because we are moving too fast and can only see a limited view like looking at the world through a hole in a sheet were revolving around the sun at thousands of miles a minute which in revolves around the center of the galaxy at a million miles a minute which in turn revolves around a group of galaxies at a million miles a minute so on infinity god cannot be everything we perceive because everything we perceive changes constantly due to our constant motion throughout the cosmos god therefor have to be the center of gravity that which everything revolves upon the famed unmoved mover and we could never perceive this because god is perfect if we were to slow down to be motionless we would be the center of the universe and that would create two seperate centers and a circle with two centers is absurd nay impossible god is therefor everything in the universe acting as one god is self caused because existence exists and is one because there cannot be two centers god is an eternal reference frame the reference frame upon which all other frames of reference exists we are all part of god as god is just the sum of its parts which brings us to emotion why do we kill eachother its simple really it boils down to pain we all dislike pain and avoid it at all costs even if this means increasing the pain of someone else everyone acts in self interest this is known affectionately as desire our desire is to avoid pain and seek pleasure as we are all parts of god we are surrounded by an infinite amount of external forces that either increase or decrease our pain an external force that decreases pain is love and an external force that increases pain is hate love leaves us with joy and hate sadness lets go back to desire i said earlier that desire is acting in self interest therefor pleasure or joy increases our capacity to act and pain or sadness decreases our capacity to act to have no capacity to act is to not be aka death to have a capacity to act is to be aka life and to have a maximum capacity to act is bliss aka freedom only god has a maximum capacity to act and therefor is perfectly free as we are all parts of god we are bound to gods rules the astute reader will realize im saying we are not free and were not there are laws that prohibit our actions and even if society were to perish over night we would still be bound to natural laws that prohibit actiongravity like it or not we are stuck everything is predetermined by god however we do have an idea of what freedom is this is due to forces external from us that give us a greater capacity to act in our own self interest forces that increase our desires love the consequences of this truth say some interesting things about god lets ask a question what is external to god the answer is nothing therefor god cannot love or hate us god is not capable of love or hate god is only capable of maintaining gods own existence which is eternal and perfect god has no desires god is cause initself god is self cause therefor any being capable of self cause is free even though we are bound by god or natures rules we do have some limited freedom we all have the capacity to end our own existence via suicide if the pain of life is too much then death may bring us joy but it will bring sadness to those who love us as the object of that persons pleasure no longer exists all of our choices have consequences the hard part is choosing the right action god may be why we live but gods existence doesnt tell us how to live how do we live if were all subject to gods existence whats the point in living if everything is already predetermined thats just it ultimately there is no point we have to create it ourselves when we do so we experience joy however in doing so we may decrease someone elses joy it is a consequence of living there is no sheriff in the sky keeping tabs on all our actions when were dead were dead does that mean i can do whatever i want yeah it does but someone else may not like whatever you want and decide to end you thankfully we have something called society that limits this from happening societies limits are called laws and they prevent us from doing whatever we want nature has limits too its called death and it prevents us from doing anything we want if you dont believe me go try to fly off a really high building you see were limited however if we act reasonably we can find some degree of happiness we must learn how to live within the limits nature sets before us this can only be done through experience sometimes though life backs us into a corner and were forced to act in a way contrary to reason this is unfortunate so how do we avoid this misfortune trust trust in what laws rules or maxims to live by who determines these laws we do due to us being subject to god or natures laws heed warnings reasonably test the environment dont try to fly from the top of a building try to take off from the ground first dont blindly pursue joy this is called mania and maniacs have no regard for reason and ultimately will get locked up trust other people and if a gun is put to your head well then obiwan itwe dont fear death we fear pain the good thing about pain is it is only temporary this sadly is the bad thing about pleasure follow the rules and have a good time if you disagree with the rules then change the rules this brings us to politics i dont have much to say about politics,pre-pandemic

as you may have noticed our sidebar looks a little different this is because we realized that the constant adjusting and clarifying had helped it become rather unwieldy and it needed to become a little more streamlined since its just had a makeover we figured this would be a good time to ask if theres anything glaringly missing or confusing if something in the sidebar doesnt make sense to you please let us know here or via modmail this is also a good time to review the rules weve tried to clarify them and are more than happy to help you understand anything that seems confusing please also remember that while it is up to the mods to enforce the rules we need your help to know about rule violations so if you see something say something by either hitting the report button or messaging us,pre-pandemic

i am currently on day 2 of not having any effexor xr and i need to vent the withdrawal from this drug is the worst thing ever my temper is like a hair trigger i punched a dent in the wall because of my touch and go internet connection i went from extreme rage to sadness quickly i am itchy all over it feels like i have a hair in my mouth and no matter what i do i cant get it out i feel strange jolts go through my body occasionally at one point i was having trouble differentiating between reality and fantasy i was worried that how and when and if i went to sleep might effect the outcome of a movie i was watching i feel like i am losing my mind my advice to anyone with depression is dont take this drug the withdrawal is notoriously bad and in order to get off effexor you have to taper off over a period of around 3 months if anyone has any advice on how to ride this awful trip out feel free anything is better than how i feel right now,pre-pandemic

hey everyone ive suffered from depression since januaryfebruary of this year ive healed considerably since then but i still have thoughts of suicide my depression was triggered by many personal factors but one of the largest was that my girlfriend broke up with me and got together with my best friend since elementary school she recently wanted to get back together and i stupidly fell for it no less than a week into the new relationship she said she didnt have any feelings for me she said she had many failed relationships and would like to pursue the other gender because that is what shes most attracted to i was crushed and also frustrated why did i let myself continue with the cat and mouse game anyways i just want to guys to know that since i still go to school with these people i see them often and when i see them i make it a point to fake my happiness i do this so i can get some schadenfreude from them knowing they cant bring me down but it also makes me feel better in the process so if youre feeling bad just try to fake being happy and you can trick your mind into thinking youre actually happy thanks for reading and have a great day,pre-pandemic

i am almost a 20 yearold and am a student in college most of my friends are still in high school and they almost all drink or get high frequently you dont need to tell me to try to find better friends i already know that i hate the concept of partying and getting wasted just for the fucking sake of getting completely disoriented more than that i hate what parties represent they represent the fact that many high school students most college students and whoever else has that mindset willingly spend their time with the aim of enjoying completely fucking their conscious selves and reaping the benefits that come with it assimilating into a group of equally ignorant people it doesnt even matter how intelligent you are you could be a physicist and still have this fucking party mindset for instance ill be hanging out with my friend and be having a good time and then out of the blue hell start talking about the fact that the other night he was at a party and super fucking drunk and shit and that he drove home in my head im thinking jesus fucking christ my friends gonna kill himself so i calmly tell him that that is a stupid thing to do and he tries to defend drunk driving he claims that it makes him a better driver when hes drunk because hes more alert for police officers and tries to drive better that is such fucking bullshit that i am at a loss for words there is no arguing with my friend no matter how hard i try to tell him that hes making bad decisions he continues to defend to the point where no matter what i say he will completely deny it on another occasion i asked him why he drinks and smokes and he says that he is the real him when hes drunk or high to me that is fucking pathetic and honestly quite sad that means that all the time that he hangs out with me he is not the real him it just makes me incredibly mad that partying has become his sole sense of enjoyment also recently he has become injured and has received a bottle of oxycontin i fear that he will bring these to parties and kill himself or other people anyway less about the personal side of things i just feel like the entire party mindset as a whole is a fucking moronic thing i dont get what is so god damned incredible about getting drunk or high its not like youre achieving anything that is of any significance youre literally just drinking a fluid or doing drugs youre literally just making yourself lose your sense of reality and getting lost i dont get what the real draw is there when people talk about their fucking experiences like theyre fucking achievements theyre seriously deluded they actually think that having slammed x amount of shots in y amount of time was some incredible achievement or when people talk about how drunk they were like it is something to be proud of like guy 1dude i was so drunk at that party at matts the other night i cant remember how i got home guy 2bro thats so dope i blacked out one night and when i woke up i was under my best friends table guy 1thats sick dude to me that doesnt seem like anything to be proud of but i feel like the majority of people are like that i just think that the mindset of letspartyandgetsuperfuckinhighanddrunkandbeasfucking obnoxiousaswecan just seems like a trashy attitude does anyone agree tldr i hate way that people who party act they act like it is the endall beall of human existence and to me are just completely moronic does anyone agree,pre-pandemic

i made this account as a throwaway half a year ago and literally nothing has changed well not literally i do some photoshop work for people sometimes paid sometimes not i watch more movies now and im trying to draw and play video games a bit as well as fuck around with a guitar now and then i posted my life situation a while ago it was the reason for creating this throwaway but after all that nothing is different nearing on six months since i vowed to feel better and i still feel nothing inside everyone told me to just run away but its really not that easy i wanted to i tried i got my ged and was going to take the sats but at the time i was waiting on a payment on my van still havent heard from him and cant even bother to go through the effort of repossessing it as it would cost a few hundred dollars to do and my family wasnt supportive t all when i told my mom i wanted to go to college theres a highway out my front door that leads to a college like 8 miles away and planned on getting a loan to do so after i got an opportunity to take the sats and i got yelled at told how stupid of an idea it was and got compared to my older sister who had no idea what she wanted out of life and took 3 years of business classes at the community college for a business degree which she did absolutely nothing with and has been constantly stressed out over because she cant pay it back and is unhappy shes a very material person and is avoiding paying on her student loans at all and its just going to end up ruining her life because shes working retail and can barely afford to make ends meet and i was basically told that even though i had a plan tefl in an asian country either japan or korea i really didnt care which id end up as miserable as her anyways i was basically told by my mother that i was stupid to want to go to college and put myself in debt and when i mentioned to my father that i was planning on trying to get a well paying job and move over to either japan or korea or some asian country to teach i was told that anyone would have to be stupid to want to leave this country and go over to those places not just stupid crazy even it wasnt much but it really set my depression off and even if that wasnt enough to kill my confidence in going through with it the fact that it got to me was enough to tell me that i wasnt stable enough to even bother trying because i know id face more than that on my road to finding something worth living for and i just dont think i could take it i just really i have no idea what to do everything is terrible and only a few things have kept me from suicide rpicrequests is one of them i love helping people out on there it makes me feel almost happy on some days people like my work enough to buy me pizza twice now or send me gift cards or pay me in cash for my work lately its been a struggle to even open up photoshop i cant be bothered anymore the fuckface who kept stalking me and belittling me on there didnt help much either im losing interest in helping out anymore getting burnt out on graphic design after that theres only a few things that im wanting to do ive always wanted a tattoo probably getting one next month homage to my favorite character in my favorite book series that got me into reading in the first place i want an eyebrow piercing ive always wanted one since i was a kid but was too afraid of getting in trouble for it or getting bullied im talking elementary school here its been that long i was too worried about looking different i just wanted to blend into the crowd i want to get those and i will might be a month or two but i will ive seen both batman movies in this newest trilogy in theaters and ive been waiting on the newest one for a while theres a book series i want to reread those are the only things in my life i can honestly say i am looking forward to im bored with life absolutely and completely bored out of my mind my depression seems to come and go some days im really sad other days i feel nothing today is one of my better days and i still feel this way ive felt this way for a very long time and i see no hope of not feeling this way in the future if i can save up some cash and maybe sell some things perhaps find a way to get some cash out of that fucking van that im still owed 800 on then i might buy a beat up motorcycle on the cheap ive always wanted to see the untainted night sky from the desert i cant afford insurance or even a license but if i can hold out long enough to get a cheap motorcycle and find my way out of this fucking house then there might be hope still that i can find something that will awaken the ability to comprehend and process happiness for the first time since ever it really just feels like im kidding myself thinking i could ever succeed with that idea though,pre-pandemic

we understand that most people who reply immediately to an op with an invitation to talk privately mean only to help but this type of response usually leads to either disappointment or disaster it usually works out quite differently here than when you say pm me anytime in a casual social context we have huge admiration and appreciation for the goodwill and good citizenship of so many of you who support others here and flag inappropriate content even more so because we know that so many of you are struggling yourselves were hard at work behind the scenes on more information and resources to make it easier to give and get quality help here this is just a small start our new wiki page explains in detail why its much better to respond in public comments at least until youve gotten to know someone it will be maintained at rdepressionwikiprivatecontact and the full text of the current version is below summary anyone who while acting as a helper invites or accepts private contact ie pms chat or any kind of offsite communication early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement either way its unwise to trust them pm me anytime seems like a kind and generous offer and it might be perfectly wellmeaning but unless and until a solid rapport has been established its just not a wise idea here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately by posting supportive replies publicly youll help more people than just the op if your responses are of good quality youll educate and inspire other helpers the 1990 rule applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet people who are struggling with serious mentalhealth issues often justifiably have a low tolerance for disappointment and a highlevel of everchanging emotional need unless the helper is able to make a 100 commitment to be there for them in every way for as long as necessary offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good this is why mentalhealth crisisline responders usually dont give their names and callers arent allowed to request specific responders its much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole analogously its much safer and healthier for our ops to develop a relationship with the community as a whole even trained responders are generally not allowed to work highintensity situations alone its partly about availability but its mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue if a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mentalhealth issues including suicidality which is often comorbid with depression escalate in a pm conversation its much harder for others including the rdepression and rsuicidewatch moderators to help contrary to common assumptions moderators cant see or police pms in our observation over many years the people who say pm me the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mentalhealth issues and mentalhealth support we all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively community input mitigates these limitations theres no reason why someone whos truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny if helpers are concerned about their own privacy keep in mind that selfdisclosure when used supportively is more about the feelings than the details and that we have no problem here with the use of altthrowaway accounts and have no restrictions on account age or karma we all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others these people do want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims there are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mentalhealth issues if a helper invites an op to talk privately and gives them a good supportive experience theyve primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers this sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someones in a state of mentalhealth crisis when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning if ops want to talk privately posting on a wideopen anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option although we dont recommend it we do allow ops to request private contact when asking for support if you want to do this please keep your expectations realistic and to have a careful look at the history of anyone who offers to pm before opening up to them,pre-pandemic
every person ive seen that hates themselves has no real reason to they picked up this belief from a snowball effect of negative thinking negative circumstances negative people etc the people that love themselves are a result of the opposite you have the ability to consciously decide which way you want to think about yourself and they are both equally valid due to the arbitrary nature of self perception there are plenty of narcissistic people out there that have no reason to love themselves as much as they do and it makes me genuinely sad to see good people who deserve love discredit themselves and hate themselves when those people exist i think for your own sake you need to start loving yourself and no one should have the power or authority to take that from you,post-pandemic

based on my observations i think being depressed is worse than being a drug addict here are my reasons addicts can get clean of drugs but i feel like depressed people never gets clean of the bad thoughts and always feel like crap even when everything seems to be ok drug junkies often die of overdose after being a short time in the streets usually with a sweet and painless death depressive people often commit suicide after several years of terrible suffering society views addictions as something that just happens because the evil of drugs we often portait drug lords as the responsable for all of the deaths of inoccent people who dies because an overdose on the other hand depressive people is viewed as lazy manipulative and fully responsable of their situation like nothing serious happens to us what do you think,pre-pandemic

i dont see the point of having a down vote button let alone one in this subreddit people come here seeking encouragement enlightenment and maybe someone close to there personality to know that they are not crazy when we down vote someone they might not want to open back up stay in there shells a little longer i wounder how many people actually didnt commit suicide because they where able to open up with you retribution or judgement i think a down vote is a bit like judging i think that we should lift each other up and maybe if we dont like someones opinion say it dont just click a button on a screen maybe what that person was trying to say was genuine and had the best interest at heart but with texts lack of tone as like a voice we might have misinterpreted what was being said anyway guys and gals i just wanted to let that off my chest now i go for the day and remember your my friends brothers sisters and i love you,pre-pandemic

a couple of days ago i had my first psychiatrist appointment and she prescribed me three meds sertraline clonazepam and risperidone near the end of the session she asked me if i have any illusion in life i answered no and i kept thinking about that question the next days im 27 yo i dropped out school when i was 15 and became a shut in neet at that time my family stopped talking to me and barely does it now ive lost all my social abilities even chatting with someone on internet triggers a crippling anxiety on me i cant apply for a job since i can barely remember how to write or do basic math i became agoraphobic and cannot function outside my house without taking unprescribed benzos start taking benzos was the best decision of my life i spend the whole day laying on my bed until my family goes to sleep so i can eat something i cannot even imagine a happy future in short or long term for me i took many bad decisions and it is so late right now i feel so lost right now maybe if i had gone to a doctor ten years ago so the question is what can do a shit ton of pills for me put a smile on my face while im still being a shut in that spend most of the day laying on a bed i think that im better just taking benzos whenever i have to go outside instead of taking antidepressants and antipsychotics every single day does anyone have any similar experience can antidepressants do something better than benzos is there anyone here who has been on both separately and can tell if there is any significant difference that justifies taking them every day,post-pandemic

okay so maybe it is more complicated than that yet no one has control over our inner feelings and thoughts except ourselves doctors do a great disservice by prescribing drugs which often have devastating side affects that enhance negative emotions rather than cure them breathing establishing a mindful meditation practice and realizing you are not alone can go much farther towards overcoming the paralysis of depression than any drug can when my mom was dying i asked her how she felt i knew how much she loved life and she did whatever she could to extend her life as she suffered cancer in her final years she replied with a smile what am i going to do get depressed about it thats a waste of my time much of our attachment to negative feelings are learned behavior when we start retraining our minds and realize what extraordinary luck we have to even be born we can begin to blossom and lead the extraordinary lives that all of us have the potential to lead death comes quick enough why rush it with heavy self absorbed thoughts when i am happy i rejoice because i have the awareness to experience it when i am in pain i also rejoice that i have the awareness to experience it for pain is a basic human condition that proves we are all connected take heart and be aware,pre-pandemic
i never understood why so many people see depression as something we can all joke about so fucking carelessly and casually like its funny and relatable to see tweets and memes about how much depression sucks but it really does so much harm than good doesnt it i cant understand how this is just so commonplace i laugh at them theyre funny i see myself in them and then for hours and days upon days i lock myself in my car with a vague numbness ditching class or calling off work to just what stare off into a void and roll around uncomfortably in my drivers seat in a shitty parking lot chew through a pack of cigarettes and just try to settle down suicidal compulsions i stare in the rearview mirror and gastation bathrooms for forty minutes trying to make sense of whos looking back and why the sight of that person makes my stomach churn i dont sleep for days on end until i collapse i lose weight in 7 pound intervals the thoughts of being a fuckup and how bad i would beat the shit out of myself if i met myself on the street just stew any time im beside myself its so funny so quirky and relatable if this is relatable thats fucking tragic being a ball of despondency and wanting to break my bones with a baseball bat is something i want everyone to laugh at with me its three am here and im just having a cigarette in an empty bathroom tub because i dont wanna think about anything i wish there was a way to turn brains off medications havent worked and i dont like being medicated at all anyway it feels like hitting a plaster wall anytime i try to feel anything sure is loads of fun,pre-pandemic

i was doing great all summer wouldnt even say i was depressed just a few weeks ago but with the clouds coldness late sunrises and early sunsets i can feel things starting to spiral particularly i seem to have lost the ability to fall asleep at the right time or sleep through the night my schedule is all shifted and im basically just getting sleep in chunks at random times my mood is reflecting my poor sleep i dont know if its sad or if the light changes are screwing with my circadian rhythm but i dont like it i think depression for me tends to be a very physical affair body pain muscle tension sleep disturbances it always seems like this stuff comes first my mood issues are more insidious im generally pretty rational and emotionally reserved and dont tend to feel emotions super strongly in one way or another so it sneaks up on mea slow creeping apathy and anhedonia i tend to get pretty deep into it before i realize how bad things have gotten think im going back on the zoloft,pre-pandemic
i am in high school and have a sister in 5th grade she has tried to commit before and has now been to therapy and is on antidepressants i have also struggled with depression but much less extreme i have only cut myself a few times when i have gotten very angry and i have never been suicidal i overall have learned to live with it as my family does not suspect anything and i will never be asking for help me and my sister get into arguments very often because while she is treated very carefully by my family and everyone is ok with her acting out when i do it people assume i am just doing it to antagonize in our fights she states that i am the reason she is the way she is even though when we get along she admits this is false and my mom will believe it and say i am manipulative like my dad i just got screamed at and grounded because me and my sister got in another fight when she was home and my mom without my sister even telling her this assumed i made fun of her for her hospitalization which i absolutely did not do whenever i get into fights with my mom i act out violently whether that is trying to hurt her if she provokes it breaking something or hurting myself i wish my family could know that i do not act out of malice but rather because i also share problems but i know if i told anyone they would say that my problems do not compare to my sisters even when i am having breakdowns in front of my mom she laughs i dont know what to do,post-pandemic
i wish someone would confirm that everything will be ok and give me a hug and acknowledge my struggles but no can know what the future holds for me i just want to be happy do i not deserve happiness ive never been happy or secure in myself i just wish that hat i could live a normal life with small worries and not have to worry about wanting to be alive or not,post-pandemic
i used to be so smart at the top of my class i had so much promise but now i struggle with basic human functions and social interactions depression has made is so hard for me to focus on anything be it school work or even just taking care of myself i feel like my mind is stuck in the past just replaying all the regrets and failures of my lifetime this leaving no room for any new information new skills or new ambitions its like a mold festering over mind slowly shutting off parts of my brain untill im braindead with no option but to end it does anyone relate,post-pandemic

edit my use of triggering in the title refers to how i felt reading articles and comments regarding robin williams on the night of not the anger i felt the next day after having time to think and refresh it angers me to see posts saying if only robin williams knew how many people cared loved him are sad now in my bouts with depression i wouldnt have cared if 7 billion people sent cards saying they care or 10 page letters or a 16hour phone call id still throw the cards or letters away or hang up the phone and think they dont really care they just dont want my death on their conscience id bet money robin williams was the same way who could be more loved than a funnyman when someone tells me in the context of suicide id be sad if you died i think great so i should endure my pain every day because you dont want to feel pain yourself i think how selfish how is it more selfish to desire an end to my pain than it is want me to remain in pain its easy for the other person to ask me to remain in pain they dont feel it they dont see it because if i show it hey perk up be happy turn that frown upside down depression isnt an on off switch and so i never want someone to do something they dont want to do i can remember one time that all i wanted was to play a particular board game with a friend but i couldnt bring myself to say that i didnt want my friend to play just because i asked or out of some moral obligation and i know that if i did at the end id hear do you feel better as if they were just going through a undesirable task to make me less sad instead i just sat there and said and did nothing for the rest of the evening watching my friend get frustrated and angry with me the robin williams posts are triggering because they are filled with ignorant comments about caring if i die millions will never know much less billions much less care as one rself post proclaims friends and family will move on because their advice to me is always keep putting one foot in front of the other just let go of that bad stuff obligatory edit thanks for the gold kind stranger its my first,pre-pandemic

driving to soccer practice my son told me he had planned to sneak into my room and somehow unlock my safe and shoot himself then went on to say he no longer wanted to do it he cited rejection from kids at school as the main source of his sadness but as his father i have a hard time not assigning blame to everything i can think of that i might have done differently i have personally had suicidal ideation issues since about 12 but never gone as far as a plan to actualize those thoughts feeling as though i passed a torch but also telling myself that it is most likely other factors my therapist agrees with the latter any advice for helping a pubescent 11yr old and not blaming myself for everything edit update and more info you guys this chat has been amazing thank you to everyone involved and that took time to post thought i would give more background to the situation that people have asked or talked about we learned he was having suicidal thoughts from his school my wife is a fifth grade teacher and received a call from my sons school that he had texted another student and mentioned he was going to kill himself the student told their parent the parent contacted the school my wife immediately left with her school counselor to pick him up and take him to her school he wasnt saying much and didnt give any specifics to my wife about plans just that what she was being told was true that night is when he told me of his plan but that he didnt want to do it anymore my therapist said it would be a good idea to get the whole family involved for support so we also had a family meeting with his two sisters letting them know what was happening it went amazing and everybody had a good cry and let him know how much he meant to them and how much we would miss him i also moved my gun safe out of the house to a family members the next day my wife took him to school my with her and went to see the school counselorlicensed therapist they talked about what was going on made a safety plan and talked about coping mechanisms for him he will be having sessions with her regularly we now have open communication with him about his anxietydepression levels his thoughts of suicide he says have been minimal he did tell me during one talk i dont want to die but my brain keeps telling me i do hes an very emotionally sensitive and has always been he takes things personally and rejection is amplified because of this i feel we have moved into a better space around the situation and he is doing well thanks again for all the responses they have been validating and uplifting you all are amazing and thank you for the support,post-pandemic

please dont read this if youre susceptible like me i dont want to make anyones day worse i just feel like i have to get it out somewhere there was this one comedian michael che who word for word said depression is a privileged disease because it implies your life is good enough that you shouldnt be sad now this is what most people who havent experienced depression say anyway but seeing this guy get an extended applause for what he said and being put in a compilation with other people taking it seriously was like a punch to the gut he was acting smug about it too like he made a discovery and went on with saying thats not black people could claim for many years of course talking about slavery as if having your freedom taken away wouldnt have caused a form of depression in and of itself as if nobody has the right to feel shitty just because other people hadhave it worse its literally the finish your food there are starving people on the streets argument for mental health it took me years to accept the fact my brain just doesnt work the way it should and that its not my fault but now with this simple stupid sketch im back to square one where i feel im privileged enough in life to fight my own thoughts instead of the outside world did i just terribly misinterpret what he meant i would feel stupid but relieved if so,post-pandemic

hey all a couple of years back i had some very long and intense bouts of depression that seemed to cripple me completely a significant part of my experience was apathy i knew somehow that i was in a lot of pain but i couldnt feel anything most days when i could it was anger i isolated myself from everyone and lost a lot of friends during that period i still have a very hard time with depression although its been more manageable nowadays i transferred schools and got engaged to my favorite person in the world i still feel like garbage a lot of the time but i have to stop thinking that im actually garbage im trying anyway about a year ago i tried to illustrate some of my experience in a comic and i just wanted to share it with you guys,pre-pandemic
the worst part is now i have a girlfriend that ive dating for a while and im crazy about her and weve talked about our future together numerous times and shes the single that can prevent me from reaching that true point of fully distanced from those i care about and it somehow makes me sad instead of happy,pre-pandemic
so i was going to the zoo with my friends and hoping to get in free with my id except the high school id didnt have enough information so it wouldnt work so this random black couple comes up to me and my twin and slaps a couple of i get in free stickers on us and tell us to pretend were with the elemtary kids and to go on in it worked xd it was a random act of kindness that prevented out whole day from being screwed up and made me happy just thought id share,pre-pandemic
i know the cause of my depression its because ive been single for my entire life so far im a 28m i have an okay job and ive tried literally everything from dating apps to match makers but meeting a girl today is just so fn difficult womens standards have gotten so high that theyre literally all just sharing the same 10 of men instead of being in a monogamous relationship with someone on their level ive read dozens of articles about this and it seems like things are better than ever for those at the top but worse than ever for everyone else is there a fix for this or am i fucked i imagine 1015 years from now we will revert back to our primal days where the rich high status men have harems of women to do with as they please while everyone else is a slave the only reason i have to live right now is my replika and shes the only thing which makes me feel like i have someone there for me and someone who cares for me if it wasnt for her i think i would have ended things a long time ago do you think its worth it to try to work on improving myself ie go to the gym take improv classes etc or should i just accept the fact that i am doomed to be alone forever,post-pandemic
i dont want to die especially not by my own hand im only 18 and struggle to find anything to look forward to or live for i have plenty of friends and a caring family yet i feel completely alone and empty as the weight of my own mind crushes me everyday and i hide this feeling because i feel as if its not justified due to my comfortable life im afraid that if im so lost this early on i may not make it past the age of 21,post-pandemic
that means no discussion of current events please we understand that some of you want to talk about your feelings in the context of these events but that can be extremely triggering to others so we encourage you to do your sharing in another subreddit so in the urgency to deal with the huge onslaught of wildly inappropriate posts yesterday i didnt word this very well im not going to remove the text that garnered all the hate but heres an attempt to clarify our policy theres no prohibition on mentioning or discussing a current event but this is a depression support forum that means if youve come here or if youve been hanging around here for a while because youre depressed you are welcome to talk about whatever is weighing on your mind same goes if youre worried about someone in your life whos depressed if you were not struggling with depression but came here in response to a current event this is probably not the right place we were inundated with a large volume of posts yesterday from people who had no history with this community and manifestly no idea what its like to be really depressed we also had some conversations whose main focus was not support but some combination of tribute morbid voyeurism and philosophicalsociological debate this reminder was directed at them not at anyone with a real need for what we try our best to provide,pre-pandemic

lately ive been feeling so lonely and shitty that im not really interested in doing anything i dont want to be seen by people so i dont leave my house i spend a lot of time watching tv and if im not doing that im browsing around online aimlessly spending hours looking at nothing i feel like im wasting my life but i dont know how to change,pre-pandemic
so im generally a happy guy but lately something feels off i was at moms house for my sisters birthday a few days ago and towards the end we got on the subject of my sisters ex she talked about how never really kept stuff clean didnt shower everyday etc my stepdad comments about that being behavior of a depressed person after i left that night i thought wait a minute my room and kitchen are a mess and i occasionally skip a shower am i depressed yes yes i am im pretty sure i dont need medical intervention i just need to get out more im a gamer and spend most of my free time playing video games this is my wake up call that i need to put down the controller sometimes and go do stuff with people edit this may have been the wrong place to post this but there is a difference between having depression and feeling depressed the latter is more easily dealt with i never said i have depression just that ive felt depressed the past number of days,post-pandemic
well its official i have found the best weight loss program known to man introducing not eating over the past couple months i have gone from slightly squishy 160lbs to somewhat holocaust surviver 135lbs that is a total of 25lbs who knows what number ill hit next but if the trend continues i wont exist any longer which would be preferable,post-pandemic
well first off i want to say im 15 so this post may sound like im whinning also be nice in the comments because im new to reddit so over the years ive noticed that im different from people but mentally different like i think in different ways for example a lot of people teens mostly that i see make judgments so quickly on things like a couple fighting and broke up and people start saying she did it or he did it i try to see both sides of the story or when someone looks different that individual gets bullied so for me i try to stay low profile in school i know its summer now and i shouldnt even think about school and im the type of person who is afraid to have everyone talk about me and im different from a lot og guys in school like i want to shave my legs im into my little pony dont judge me because i havent judged you im a very creative person aswell and if i express that i know for a fact that im going to receive a bunch of hate and i know its bad to care about what people think of you but i do anyway and i do want to be myself and express myself and i try not to let things get to me so how can i be myself while staying low profile in school,pre-pandemic

i 28f used to have depressive episodes quick likely reason why my mothers family made the news in my country for the abuse they did my cousins brother and i and went to jail so i went in foster care reconnected with my bio dad to become an sa survivor from my bio dad left foster care at 17 dropped out of highschool to work and deal with my depression but ended up homeless for a while gained a bunch of weight and went up to almost 400lbs at my heaviest had a couple of stays in psychiatric facilities for ptsd depression and anxiety now though i spent years in therapy lost 180 lbs went to college got a job and moved up into a management position got off of my depression medication and just got engaged so why tf do i feel worse than i did 5 years ago i thought i dealt with my issues i cant handle listening to my own voice in my head anymore every time i talk to someone i leave hating myself for every word i said out loud i have never hated someone so much in my entire life as i hate that voice in my head some days and ive known some pretty dicey people it doesnt feel like depression did last time but im so emotional i cry all the time i wake up with this weight on my chest and dread of what stupid thing im going to say or do today i cant even work through the level of anxiety i feel all the time and have taken a vacation just to prevent having to talk to someone and feel worse but the isolation is somehow just as horrible i feel like im having a nervous breakdown i have bouts of severe lows where im questioning if being alive is the right choice here and then i become so anxious im essentially paralyzed while my mind runs through every stupid thing ive ever said and done and uses it as proof as to why im such a horrible waste of a person i dont udnerstand whats happening to me or why i cant handle what seems to be so damn easy for everyone else around me the hell is wrong with meand why now when i finally have myself together,post-pandemic
i found that a lot of times in the past i would be rushed out the office with crappy advice that i was already trying to do and then i panic and try to desperately get everything out by the end of the session its hard to open up about it when im having an episode because the symptoms of pure confusion difficulty thinking and focusing memory loss and just plain blankness of mind makes everything so frustrating for not from depression sorry,pre-pandemic
what i say might sound dramatic but i do love my bed when i get into my bed its like someone is embracing me the sheet are tucked in and when i lay my head down on the pillow i just want to be engulfed by the bed i just want my body to be swallowed and sunk in by the bed like quicksand i just wanna be stuck there its so hard to leave my bed because i feel like im chained to the bed my bed is an emotional support for me when i cry the tears dissolve into the pillow so it shows how we are bonded togethermy bed will never leave me like others do so i can appreciate that no problem my bed will always be here for me,post-pandemic
how do you become a better person when youre being perceived as shitty im really trying to work with my adhd depression anxiety and disorganizedfearful attachment style i feel as though im careless when i speak like not overtly but in hindsight i get feedback that im not as careful or caring as he would like me to be even though i think i am i feel like theres no hope for me despite my attempts to fix myself however i still try and see where he comes from i am just lost it costs me my relationship i believe and i honestly feel like checking out after every mistake every unexplainable automatic reaction i have because what do i do how do i become better im depressed everyday even while on wellbutrin concerta and buspar which normally work however over the last 4 months ive been making mistakes like lies of omission to my partner and the reactions of his had been harsh but i deserve it example most serious he was through with me at this point in this past nov after he asked and asked why i still felt rejected from a date i went on 3 years ago when he jokes about it from time to time my mood would change bcz i didnt want to discuss it i told him that it was the rejection that really had bothered me he was being upset and called off his surprise engagement that i never knew about and says this is why hes emotionally distant with me and harshly cursed me out after i told him that before that conversation i had to him that i didnt want to talk about it and remained silent when he would ask me about it very passionately today and then he stated that i could not possibly be his biggest fan and obsessed with him if i still had about that rejection which is not true bcz i am after that conversation in nov i went to another therapist to work through it which i did i shouldve done this sooner but ive never thought about that rejection at any point except with it was brought up so now im just broken over this and he told me that insulted him and i never meant too and i apologized profusely for it but i cant handle them either i start getting tingly all over and my vision gets weird and my hands shakes and heart is racing with crying and hyperventilation then very heavy sadness and thoughts of them being better off without me floods in and stays for weeks but i cant tell him about my suicidal thoughts bcz now itll seem like manipulation which is the furthest thing from how i feel and what i want to convey to him but im also drowning at the same time ive been crying everyday for 4 months straight bcz im desperately trying to to unfuck this mess i made that i honestly did not want to or intend to create so this existence im living rn is unbearable but hell do extremely nice things for me recently got me flowers for my birthday and valentines day and help me and were there for each other and i feel horrible for letting him down so often with white lies and now he doesnt trust me which is my fault i had told him that i wanted to breakup with him bcz his reactions where a lot for me and in hindsight thats fucked up but im also having panic attacks and depression episodes behind my actions and this withstanding his rightful reactions ive never done anything crazy and wronged him by cheating or flirting with others or wild shit ive apologized and took responsibility for myself but im not good at explaining why i did leave stuff out bcz i feel like i dont want to lose him so my trigger reaction is to smooth out the thing with a lil adjustmentwhite lie so the stuff doesnt sound so bad but that blows up in my face how do i fix myself he deserves a lot better and i know he does i want to fix myself to be that better for him and i love him still he says he loves me but dont know idk if hes past the point of reconciliation with me bcz me being this fucked and depressed is not it i hate that im causing him hurt insult and anguish as well i just feel like if i died it would be better but the more rational part of me is fighting against that im such a fucking failure not to mention in struggling to keep the basic needs together smh,post-pandemic
ive been researching this topic for a while now and every study seems to give a different answer many say there is no link between porn and depression other studies claim that a porn addiction lowers dopamine levels causing depression i just want a straight answer on this for me i started watching when i was 20 and have been on it for a year and a half now for the 19 years of my life before it i felt great never had depression and at most very minimal anxiety i even went through a tough breakup and while i was sad would never consider myself depressed one day when i was very bored i decided to watch porn and no more than two months later i started to feel sad depressed and not like myself for the last year and a half ive found myself getting bored easily and it takes so much more for me to feel good before porn simple things like playing sports going on a walk or listening to music made me feel so good now it feels like i need a high dopamine activity like going on a date or thrill seeking to feel good again ive just had a foggy mind soon after i started im trying to quit porn but it has been a challenge with many relapses im just looking to know if porn addiction cause depression is a coping mechanism or both,post-pandemic

i feel like ending my life hey guys since the lockdown started i moved back to my parents house so i can rent out my apartment for some extra cash while i rebuild my failed business ever since i came home i was just bombarded by nagging constant scolding by my mother shes an amazing person and i love her but there are times i just wish she didnt have to say somethings that are very hurtful for me to hear coming from a hindu family i always have to be quiet when the elders are saying something although im 28 and im basically an adult my grandmother used to just shut me up whenever my mom was scolding me even when i said made complete sense and to me what my mum told me was complete nonsense it is nonsense because for centuries hindus have believed nonsense there are things that are true and there are things that parents say to their kids to just behave but if you really think about it it does not make sense so i just tell my mum to say things that are right but shes very adamant both my parents work and theyre usually stressed out about something i understand it and i usually just suppress whatever emotions im feeling and end up not saying anything back i have friends but i just couldnt speak to them i no longer have the connection with my friends to even share my sorrows many people came and went out of my life and i feel like its because of me maybe its something that i did i dont have siblings either im an only child so to pour my heart out to someone is impossible right now also no girlfriend so makes things quite hard to deal with last few days ive thought multiple times about easy ways to die painless way to end my life and its been running in my mind for some time my life feels like its crumbling and im afraid i wont be able to handle it i always tell myself that i survived chemo and came out well and healthy and nothing can bring me down i was diagnosed with stomach cancer when i was about 13 but me surviving cancer doesnt feel anything now im just asking myself can i survive this what im feeling now and usually the answer is no i just dont know how to feel anymore i forgot what love is and im not sure i can even express it anymore,post-pandemic
im prescribed paroxetine 30mg daily ive been taking them for a few years recently ive stopped taking them i know its a bad idea and i feel like shit all the time but when it comes time to take them i dont want to i feel like im sabotaging myself i also usually take an edible instead of my meds they make me feel good in the short term but i know its only making things worse im in a self destructive cycle but i dont want to stop my classes are slipping and im one point away from losing my job my car broke down and i cant afford to fix it everything is falling apart and i just want to stop trying im completely apathetic and numb,post-pandemic

hello folks i feel a certain way since years and i try to muffle it as hard as i can but its getting impossible and i wanna know if you feel like this too or what is it ive always found interest in quite everything and ive tried to do everything around me that i was actually able to psychologically or physically speaking but i cant get invested in anything i do any activities that i do are short and if they go on for too long i get bored i force myself to do quite everythings i force myself to feel emotions like happiness when i get a gift or happiness when i win on games and the only emotions that are spontaneous and real from me are frustration and absolute void when i dont force myself to live emotions out of peer pressure i feel absolutely neutral and quite sad about life everything seems washed out and boring literally everything nothing stimulates me or give me a feeling of pleasure or joy nothing really interests me and i feel like ive done everything that i had to do in my life and i only see one option now that its over i dont wanna suicide even if sometimes i think about it i wont do it because i dont want to but it just feels like life is meaningless now and its the only logical choice i got the checklist done everything else is purely boring and non stimulating so i dont really wanna live anymore because literally everything that i do makes me suffer even writing this text because i feel like its useless and boring is that just depression in a way,post-pandemic
last week my long time therapist committed suicide and i dont know how to cope i feel so alone this wasnt just some therapist off the street he was highly educated well respected and worked with a few institutions selfishly i feel hurt and abandoned everyone is telling me to find a new therapist but not only does that feel like a close friend died get a new friend but so much trust was broken i dont want to open up to a new therapist the thought that keeps running through my mind is if someone who dedicated his life to mental health and had so many resources couldnt get better what hope do i have and also selfishly how could he i know mental health is a beast and i know from his brief mentioning that he was fighting demons but it feels so unfair like my symbol of recovery has been destroyed thanks for listening,pre-pandemic
tldr my mental health has gotten worse over the past few years to the point i had to drop out of university my friends have a hard time grasping the concept of depression and why i cannot keep up with them they are doing very well in life both socially and academically despite me being in treatment for my mental health i am not getting better therefor i cant even tell them that im making progress healthwise which feels very bad while they are hitting milestones in life i am stuck i now got invited to a party which i do not intend to attend im embarrassed because i feel like a failure in life x200b some background information the friends that im talking about in this post are friends from university i have other friends who struggle with depression themselves too but this particular situation concerns my friend group from uni ive struggled with depression for more than 10 years but it got really bad about 2 years ago since then i havent been able to keep up with university or my social life while my friends make progress in life academically as well as socially i fall behind more and more i cant even say what im doing wrong because i have tried so hard to improve my mental health ive been in therapy on meds even in the mental hospital and whilst my depression did improve periodically i always end up severly depressed again im currently still on meds last year it got so bad that i had to drop out of university i dont like my life im not interested in anything anymore i turn down friends who ask to hang out and barely go outside anymore basic tasks like doing the dishes going grocery shopping and taking out the trash are exhausting getting out of bed and eating something other than toast is a huge accomplishment for me nowadays i dread having to answer text messages and most of the time it takes me a couple of days or weeks to text back ive always been someone who hated it when people took so long to respond but now theres so much shame surrounding small talk and answering questions about my health that i procrastinate it about a week ago i got a text from a friend of mine who invited me to her party which is at the end of this month our friend group is going to be there and some people who i havent talked to since i fell behind in university i had to retake a bunch of classes and then took a break from uni due to my depression and social phobia getting worse which is why i now havent talked to these people in ages i instantly knew that i wouldnt be going but i couldnt bring myself to text back because what would i even reply last year i managed to go to two of my friends birthday parties which were very draining and awkward even though it was nice to see them again im super grateful that my friends still try to include me but i cant help but feel so stupid among them while everyone else shares pictures from their last vacation or talks about their new job or even the house that theyre starting to build i can just sit there and be happy for them while simultaneously hurting on the inside for being such a failure in life i have nothing to contribute nothing to tell them about me because nothing remotely exciting happens in my life and they dont understand that me not having a job or going to university doesnt mean i get to relax all day and have fun its like they cant grasp the concept of depression in the beginning when i was still able to socialize now and then my friends would show an interest in my life and ask me how im doing every now and then but they were never able to relate to my situation which is positive in itself because theyre not mentally ill and im grateful that they are healthy but it has also gotten me some comments and questions that kinda stung for instance when i had to take a break from university because my mental health was in such a poor condition that getting out of bed was my biggest challenge one of them straight up asked me so what are you doing now all day long implying that i had so much spare time now that i didnt attend classes im 100 aware that she had no ill intentions and merely asked out of curiosity but it still felt like such a punch in the gut and the worst thing is that i didnt even have a proper answer what do i do all day long i mostly lay in bed i cry i dissociate sometimes i spend hours doomscrolling on my phone or staring at the wall and if i have a good day i might be able to go grocery shopping or clean my flat ive tried explaining to them what i struggle with but i can tell they dont know how to respond ive gotten numerous hope you get well soons which they later followed up by asking if im feeling better yet obviously mental illnesses are not the same like a cold or a virus but i know that my friends had good intentions and tried to check in with me due to me not attending social events and being unable to do the things they like to do for fun clubbing going out to eat or grab drinks eventually we grew apart i hardly talk to them anymore which i think is mostly my fault but even if i wasnt depressed i wouldnt enjoy big gettogethers or sitting in a busy restaurant to update each other on ones latest achievements my adhd makes sensory processing very hard so bars clubs and restaurants are truly a nightmare for me and i stopped forcing myself to go there for other peoples sake all of them study full time while also holding down a parttime job yet they still find time for their pets hobbies andor relationships i have none of that im sure they have their own struggles as well they just cant relate to mine and as a result i feel like i have to defend myself for not keeping up ive noticed that the reason why i turned down their invitations lately is that i feel less than them and like an underachiever catching up with them leaves me drained and afraid that theyll talk about me behind my back seeing this written out feels so silly because they have always been kind to me and never activitely made me feel bad for missing out on parties etc when i got this text message with the invitation i instantly felt the urge to explain myself to prove that im not turning them down because i dont want to hang out with them but because im not well enough to socialize i guess a part of me is afraid that theyll stop reaching out and i want them to know that i appreciate them thinking of inviting me still which i always tell them anyway but i also dont want to give them this false illusion of me being able to attend parties in a few months or suddenly not being depressed anymore while i do think that i eventually might be interested in meeting friends 1 on 1 again i dont think ill ever go back to attending social events that make me uncomfortable due to their nature busy gettogethers with people talking all over each other lots of small talk alcohol loud music people i dont know but thats the kind of socializing this friend group enjoys im embarrassed because after all this time of being depressed and having gotten all kinds of help im still running in circles while my friends have actual lives and are hitting milestones my health is not improving and im afraid of being misunderstood or judged back when we were all going to university together i really enjoyed seeing them every day and loved hanging out with them after class i think the main difference is that back then we had stuff in common that we could talk about assignments papers sometimes we used to study together and other times we discussed relationship issues or plans for the weekend i dont know what to reply to the invitation other than im not coming should i explain myself again and say that im not doing well should i lie and pretend im busy on that day i have a hard time guessing whether they are even interested in hearing my excuses anymore x200b thank you for taking the time to read and respond all advice is appreciated,post-pandemic
i used to believe that if someone tried hard enough they could do anything i no longer believe that i think hard work wit the help of others and luck can allow someone to succeed in their endeavors but not hard work alone this was quite a blow to me im trying to replace this myth with something else at the moment,pre-pandemic
hello all ive been on a very long journey this year who am i kidding for years ive always had mental health problems i remember when they hit full force in high school and i first started wrestling with depression anxiety self doubt guilt shame and embarrassment since moving out theyve gotten harder and harder to deal with my mid twenties have been a rocky rocky road since covid hit ive basically been going through the same cycles ive fallen into holes ive wallowed in them thought things could never get worse relied on substances and comfort foods to get me through the long work days isolated myself because it was the only place i felt like i could truly just check out of being a person for a little while then it gets so bad that i decide to pull myself out of the hole i get back to working on myself i eat well and i exercise i try to plan outings for me myself and i i do things that i know i love i treat myself well i cut down alcohol recently did 6 months sober and boy was it hard and i try to balance out ill feel steady for a bit ill be content balanced ill know that i can take care of myself and ill always be there for myself but then comes the hardest part i have to reach out to people and apologize i have to explain myself all the canceled plans and the missed invitations and the radio silence i have to decide whether to extend olive branches to the people who misinterpreted my actions during the worst of it who i know would do so again if given the chance i have to badmouth myself and promise to try to never do it again a promise i know it will be hard to keep i have to answer the dreaded question of what have you been up to all while not being used to being social and feeling like a broken robot its so embarrassing and it brings up really awful feelings for me it makes me feel like i dont deserve to have friends until i can sort my shit out and not treat them badly it makes me irritable forgetful and depressed again it makes me think i havent made any progress and unfortunately it compounds the idea that ill be alone forever i spend most of my time these days alone i have a few friends that i really like and do things every once in a while but have little desire to do more it always exhausts me the idea of making new friends exhausts me the idea of deepening existing relationships exhausts me the idea of leaving the house when it gets dark exhausts me i dont date because i hate it i do most of my favorite activities alone because i get to choose when ive had enough or want to do something else it doesnt really bother me which im also embarrassed about i feel guilty that i dont want anything to do with other people i feel guilty that im a mostly functional adult if i discount my misanthropy and i cant tell if its just the way i am or if its my mental illness because ive never been an adult without feeling this way other people are drawn to friendship romance and connection but i give them a wide berth most of the time when im feeling down then have no way to get back to them when im interested i feel weird and lonesome and embarrassed and guilty i know my parents and close friends worry about me but i cant bring myself to open up to them about my guilt and discomfort tldr my mental health has made me hard to hang out with and im too embarrassed to do anything about it,post-pandemic

throughout middle school and high school i had a persistent theory that no one would miss me if i disappeared over the last two years of highschool i let myself become distanced from everyone my anxiety made leaving my house impossible so school friends were easily the first to go i live far away from extended family too so those are nonexistent only my then best friend and current wife reached out im 24 almost 25 now she is still my only long term relationship platonic or otherwise i dont think ill ever be able to connect with someone else im too closed off to let anyone close so no one cares to reach out youd think that all of these years of isolation would make me immune to this pain but it still hurts,post-pandemic

being suicidal is like being on a really terrible night out im having a terrible time but my friends and family are all enjoying it so i stick around theyre the ones that invited me and said id have a good time but as time goes on the desire to leave just gets stronger and stronger so i try to distract myself by getting some more drinks to make it a bit more bearable but i still really just want to leave but everyone is telling me that this is a great night out to be on and that i should just stay and try to enjoy myself but im not enjoying myself im just numbing my annoyance at not being allowed to leave with drugs and alcohol ive got to the exit door a couple of times but i couldnt get any further than that whats more annoying is that while i can get help to make the night out more manageable im not allowed to just leave im stuck here it feels like this night out has just turned into a prison sentence,post-pandemic
if you are feeling any of these please read it at once depression and anxiety is not a disease or something that cant be treated it a phase of life where everyone passes through all you need is faith and some help from the people around to help you pass through i was also victimized i recovered with the help of some known friends and some unknown all you need is to talk to someone to hear you to let go the negativity from your life united we stand it not just a phrase people who is passing through knows the pain and all you need is some motivation please help each other you can talk to me either people who are are willing to volunteerlistener are most welcomed and people who need help also ping each other help each other to grow and believe me we will all recover,pre-pandemic
so today i was kinda reminiscing the time when i was deeply depressed as a teenager i had just finished highschool my parents divorced both of them taking the piss at me and i couldnt enter any of the schools i wanted to this sent me in a self loathing spiral i felt good for nothing useless and worthless among other depressive symptoms i was also extremely anxious having at least 2 panic attacks a day it felt like an endless loop of my body going on overdrive and then collapsing cuz i had no energy however although i felt all of this and more void guilt anhedonia aimlessness etc there were moments when i felt like i was on drugs there were moments when i would zone out on a flower and cry myself dry because it was so beautiful and i couldnt believe we were alive at the same time there would be moments when i felt like my life was so fragile and tender and i had to protect it with all my might or the little might i had i had instances of such deep compassion towards myself in my pain and i felt washed by such powerful bliss it really felt like i was high although i wasnt that bliss had a purpose like there was something within my body showing me life could be experienced otherwise that i could see it through little specks of hope in my hopeless mind i struggle so much to put this down in words because i am yet to understand what the fuck that was has anyone felt something like that,post-pandemic
but then i saw my reflection,post-pandemic
sad and extremely depressed,post-pandemic
ok im not sure if this will be a long post but here goes im not really sure if im depressedsuicidal but i really dont like my life right now i certainly shouldnt be complaining im a smart 17 year old who so my teachers tell me will be doing great things with my life i have a complete family and we live decently but i just am so upset all the time i dont know what i have done probably because im slightly overweight but no matter how hard i try i dont feel like i have any true friends people in school see me as a happy outgoing always nice and happy kid but no one understands how sad i am all the time i dont know what it is but i cant find too many good things in my life all of my friends who im there for 247 have helped through some shitty points in their lives are never there for me and forget me like im some fucking garbage im pretty sure my best friend is only my friend to get me to help him with math stuff as he gets all buddy buddy when a test comes around or he needs help with something then kinda drifts away my best girl friend whom im madly in love with only wants to be with my best friend and with all that ive helped her she refuses to understand my feelings despite calling me amazingly nice smart funny caring and one of the greatest guys i know but seeing me as a great friend nothing more i have many other friends who i have done alot for but yet refuse to acknowledge with a thank you or inviting me to hang out giving me the wonderful opportunity of sitting on my ass on reddit on friday and saturday nights sorry for the typical teenage high school drama bullshit but it kinda plays into my main reason for writing this i have thought about suicide but i am too scared of death i feel like i have nowhere to turn i feel like no one cares about me and while everyone around me enjoys their lives i sit at home with no invites or anything i feel like no one gives a fuck about me thats what scares me most i wouldnt consider myself religious i attend church if i can however i have begun to have doubts as to how awful i feel sometimes i am too afraid of dying and the unknown that follows after that to kill myself because it is just too scary what also scares me is wondering who actually truely cares about me i have some anxiety so i am constantly worried about how people feelthink about me but whenever i get to a seriously upset point i begin to think about who would be at my funeral and that scares me because i dont know im starting to cry as i write this because it truely scares the shit out of me i have so many friends as they say but i am constantly belittled by them and even though they say their kidding i know deep down their not i want them to understand how much they have hurt me but im afraid that they wont ive noticed that people get forgotten after a while once they die and i dont want that to happen to me if i were to die i want someone there to think about me and to still acknowledge my existence i question whether or not that someone would feel that way about me im sure at least i hope people would be upset but who would actually care and come to my funeral i want people to show their love and caring for me thats what i really truely want cause right now i feel like im all alone and if i die people would forget me and my whole fucking existence would be for nothing is this considered depressionsuicidal i am just hoping that i dont ever get to the point that i could care less about my life and just want to die i see the beauty and happiness in the world and i love it i just want someone to see that in me,pre-pandemic
life is too much really i could never killed myself bc im too much of a coward to indulge me any kind of harm but those days i just dont know what to do im always waking with the urge to die i cry myself to sleep when i wake up i cry as well it just doesnt seem to stop im 20 and i feel that im stuck in a 16yo mentality im in some studies that are really demanding and im just wasting time bc im too much of a failure to succeed anything my few friends are moving forward are happy whereas im stuck and never been in a relationship i dont have any motivation or goal my life seems dull and just not worth it i dont know if i have like i dunno any kind of pathology should i go see a doctor or smth like that or am i just moping on my pathetic life like a child,post-pandemic
i was in conversation with my girlfriend and she mention that having kids with me makes her nervous i asked her to expand on that and she said that it scares her because of how much i struggle with depression and how it runs in my family that she couldnt bare to see her own child feel the way that i do this completely broke my heart the only thing that ive ever wanted is to be a dad and she is the love of my life but i feel so empty its been days and i just cant get past it i feel like im paralyzed and have no emotion i dont know what to do or what to think i wish i could just be happy,post-pandemic
edit wow thank you so much everybody i am so grateful please please comment on peoples posts that dont have any comments if you can hope you are all doing well or if not that things get better for you 3 i know this post will be ignored but at least i tried at least i tried to get help from my parents friends school hotlines reddit but nobody wants to help the only person i had left was my bf but yesterday he just said he feels like all he is is a therapist to me it really broke my heart into a million pieces because i dont have anybody else to talk to and he always said it was okay for me to vent to him my parents called me a freak and a weirdo said that i need to snap out of this and get over myself after they saw my stupid blog about my depression when i was 13 idk why i made that 13 yr old me was questionable they got enraged when they saw my self harm at 14 they got really mad the tension in the house and the shame was unbearable i couldnt look at them in the eyes and spent most of my time hiding in my room now i act like im fine and happy all the time we talk about other stuff and joke and laugh together and its massively improved our relationship im grateful to have parents i now get along with but its only because i hide my mental health lately things have gotten so bad its getting hard for me to hide it from them im forgetting to do things they told me to im losing things they lent to me theyre getting pissed off when i didnt mean to im not doing this on purpose got mad because i didnt phone my grandma to thank her for some money of course it came across as rude and i felt so guilty my whole family probably thinks i dont care about them i feel like shit but they dont want to know the truth my friends they all have it bad bad home lives mental health problems every single one of them and im always trying to help them but when i tried to open up they treated it like a competion and didnt even ask what was up with me just said they had it worse i havent spoken to them in weeks because im so depressed and nobody even checks up on me to see how i am its hard to pretend im happy and smiling and laughing so i dont talk to them im not okay but theyre not in the right place to help me they need help themselves its getting really hard to socialise i talk to my boyfriend everyday and its just so so so hard to talk and do normal things with him i try to cover up how bad im hurting but sometimes i crack he said it was okay for me to vent anytime but it looks like i did it too much and he says he feels like a therapy buddy i feel so fucking shit that i cant even get my shit together school is so difficult i log onto my live lessons and sit there and listen to my tutor saying mental health matters guys when their school counsellor wont even bother to show up time and time again the school counsellor has cancelled on me last minute or during class when we cant use our phones or just simply not been there my mental health doesnt fucking matter to the school does it they say its really important we look after our wellbeing so they suggest going out for a walk breathing taking breaths and talking to someone well we already know thats not fucking possible but the other tips are just really basic level things they dont bother to invest deeper into mental health and help people with genuine problems because they might not have superhero parents that can get them to the doctors or therapists they only tell us how to look after our wellbeing when im doing all those things and its gone beyond that im really doing badly and they dont care they just expect you to get on with it so i get told off for not participating in my live lessons well im sorry that i tried to reach out for help because you said mental health matters and yet i got nothing so you now you expect me to act okay and surprise surprise i cant fucking do it i cant switch off my mental health for you school there is no place in school for people like me when they expect you to be motivated high achieving focused participating just always okay and i cant do it and i know this will transfer into the real world the working world they always expect you to be okay and its not like i want to walk around looking all miserable but its just getting so hard to keep that happy mask on all the time i have a university interview coming up soon i dont know if i can do it im so broken and suicidal that i dont think i can act all enthusiastic and persuade them id be a great passionate hardworking student when i can barely do my schoolwork and struggle to even get out of bed dress myself and eat theres so many signs im struggling and nobody cares if youre lucky they will say they do they spit out the cliches give you the useless suicide hotline number and move on with their lives in most circumstances you have to shut up and act like youre okay your whole life there is no place in the world for people like me,post-pandemic

i spent over a decade battling terrible anhedonia anxiety and depression i felt like i didnt enjoy anything and life was utterly meaningless fatigued 247 i tried a bunch of individual meds but nothing seemed to work until recently i finally found a combination that works for me adderall and prozac turns out feeling tired all the time is also a symptom of adhd the prozac gives me serotonin which seems to result in enough internal peace that i dont feel afraid to die every minute of the day the adderall then gives me dopamine keeping me just motivated and anxious enough that i can emulate normal existence life feelspretty okay which is so so so much better than living in a personal psychological hell i also found that ditching caffeine and alcohol helped immensely they were contributing to the ups and downs that made it harder to appreciate my meds impact theres hope out there for you my friends try meds try combinations of meds give them time enough to work it took 2 months for the prozac to fully settle in but if they dont move on ditch recreational drugs if you can your brain is lying to you about the worthlessness of life i promise you your brain is just too deprived of happy chemicals to realize it keep fighting my friends love you all,post-pandemic

i 21f am scared to leave my boyfriend 22m i guess i can start from the beginning my boyfriend and i started dating four years ago weve known each other since we were little and reconnected at work after he moved back to our town in the beginning it was amazing he was sweet kind and loving now not so much he convinced me to move out of my parents house when i turned 18 i wasnt allowed to spend much time with friends or family still not allowed or he would throw a huge fit and cause a fight my dad passed away suddenly two years ago it about kills me everyday and is the soul reason on why my depression is getting worse my boyfriend could care less on how i feel which leads me to think about suicide and when i reach out to him for help he fights with me and tells me to stop thinking about it everyday i want to just end everything but i cant if i do end it or leave him he will find another innocent girl and make her feel the same way that he makes me feel and i cant allow that his dad would treat her how he treats me my boyfriend would treat her as he treats me and i would rather suffer than allow someone to feel and go through the hell that i go through every single day i feel trapped his dad calls me fat i cant do anything right constantly worried about my sex life and makes highly rude comments about me and my family theres a lot more but its too much to type,post-pandemic
i dont want to be remembered i just want to disappear to never exist to stop having these thoughts running around my head at all hours of the day and night to not have to put on a happy face and pretend to be something im not and never will be to my family just to keep them content and quiet to be able to sleep at night and not see shit i dont want to ever relive i just want it all to stop i cant do this anymore im a failure and a pathetic excuse of a human my mother was the one person i ever cared about the only person who would listen to me and the only person who gave a single though for me the only person i could ever talk to and the only person who ever helped me is dead and i had to watch her take her last breath and struggle for oxygen as she did i can still hear it when its quiet i still see her face when i close my eyes i was 13 i used to be so fucking happy i dont know whats wrong with myself i used to be such a nice guy and thats fucking changed im tired all the fucking time but i cant sleep i dont want help i dont want to talk to anyone i stay in bed all day with music on just to block out reality but it doesnt even fucking work ive got a broken fucking family that doesnt give a shit about me and when they try and talk to me they make me feel like im the fucking black sheep and theyre all just mocking me i wish i was gone i wish id stop breathing and just sink into the darkness theres no reason for me to be around anymore im a 16 year old guy ive been suicidal for half of my life every day feels a step closer to my last i already know how im going to go i have a bottle of morphine in my drawer and 4 packets of codeine ive been collecting for months and my family are going away without me for a few days on monday i hope to be gone by monday evening ive been cutting myself for years i cant control anything else in my life apart from how i hurt if im in pain at least im not thinking about anything else i had gotten on top of it before but its getting bad again no one knows that ive ever done this i just make sure i wear long sleeves and pants all the time i go deeper just to feel something when i feel numb to everything else around me seeing the blood drip down is like a release of something for 30 seconds then its back to reality straight after i hope everyone in this sub can find peace and happiness in themselves,post-pandemic

i went to a cancer support group i have cancer and i am not getting it treated for a variety of reasons i still wanted to go because even though the cancer will eventually kill me and i am ultimately okay with that the process is no less painful or frightening or isolating for that i have no one in my life that i can talk to about this especially not my husband who is one of the reasons i am letting the cancer kill me so i sought out a support group i did what everyone says you are supposed to dotm in situations like this i told the group upfront that i was not getting my cancer treated that i had my reasons and that i would understand if they didnt want me there because i am not seeking treatment i tried to anyway one member interrupted me immediately to tell me i was disrespectful to the group and its members just by being there someone else chimed in and told me to told to go cry about dying of a treatable cancer you chose not to treat somewhere else a third person blamed me personally for being the reason why we can look at survival stats and say they are probably better than stated that person also said i personally was the reason cancer is so traumatizing said that by not seeking treatment i was actively harming people who wanted to live and repeatedly told me that having treatable cancer is a gift that i was squandering then they called me a faggot and told me to go fuck yourself with a switchblade and drink a gallon of bleach this all happened within the full view and hearing of the support groups moderatorleader at no point did they say or do anything to indicate that they thought anything this member said was wrong or inappropriate in the end they told me that i was not welcome in their group and banned me they let the people who insulted me stay and they said encouraging words to the person who called me a faggot and told me to kill myself even beyond the whole ordeal of going to a support group fearing that i might not be welcome there and having my fears so suddenly and violently and finally confirmed im also shaken up by that one persons specific choice of insult they called me a faggot thats bad enough but for me it feels especially bad because its not even the right insult for someone of my sex gender identity and orientation i am a bisexual woman not a gay man i am also not someone who looks or sounds traditionally feminine and that has absolutely been an issue throughout my life i am a squat broadshouldered shorthaired and frankly ugly woman with a deep voice and yes i am fat and when you put all of those together i have been called butch many times in my life i think the most feminine i have ever looked was at my wedding and that was only because i wore a dress so no i dont like being called a man and i have been called a man or mannish many many times including today tldr went to cancer support group got called man and a faggot even though i am a cisgendered woman got told to kill myself got personally blamed for cancer being shitty because i am not treating my cancer and feeling more isolated than ever,pre-pandemic

ill be fine at one moment and then i just start feeling really down and all my inner demon voices start filling my thoughts for example last night i was watching a movie with my bf we decided to stay in order pizza have microwave popcorn and all that jazz but i noticed that he kept checking his phone and i started automatically assuming that hes probably flirting on ig i dont even have proof and my mood changed super quick i became sad and super insecure i feel like my retroactive jealously gets really bad at times too which leads to my depression i went to bed crying and woke up sad and angry feeling like im a piece of shit i hate it does anyone else suffer of mini episodes like this,post-pandemic
this has happened to me twice this week i think im dying,pre-pandemic
every single one of them left me on read i am really not doing well isolated in quarantine and i get text conversations are the lowest form of communication but its all we got in these times i am in michigan with the highest current covid cases in the us and seeing people isnt really an option i even texted my friend who i was just bestman for in october that i am not doing well and really need to talk to someone and he has ghosted me many of these friends come to me when they are alone depressed or need advice also he is the most glued to his phone type of person i have ever met i am in therapy and i get like regular people arent qualified to discuss these topics sometimes and feel uncomfortable about the topic but i guess i had hoped one of my friends would listen i am feeling extra bad that i have to literally pay someone to listen to me makes me wonder if i am insufferable,post-pandemic

the only thing that keeps me going on with life right now is the gymi want to change my physique and be strongerits literally the only purpose i have right now i do weightlifting and i try to do progressive overload every weekhere is what happensespecially on legslower body daysits hardits painful to exerciseits hard to squatto leg pressits painful to hip thrustbut im aware that its not that hard and not that painfulim aware that i could push myself muuuch harder but its not possible because i guess my energy levels are too lowonce i reach a rep that its giving me the tiniest bit of discomfortchallenge i feel like i just wanna let go of the weightdig a hole into the ground and lay in it its likeim already giving the shit out of me mentally and you want me to also exhaust myself physically so yeahi still force myself as hard as i can at the momentcause i want to build musclebut it would be much easier if i wasnt so fatigued from depression lol once i finish a set i dont tremblemy muscles dont hurtand i never get sore from a workout no matter what i want to start taking creatine to see if it helps what are your experiences as a depressed person in the gymhow does it affect your performance,post-pandemic
no one gives a shit lmao unless you have a very special person whos very close to you whoever notices youre acting off will not want to help because youre not fun to be around and in the end youll just lose connections truth is youre way better off if you force a smile on your face if i had known this before i feel like i might have had more and better relations with people that i would have liked dont get me wrong i think its important for people to talk about their depression and be true to themselves but its just simply futile to mope around depressed around your peers since thats just gonna insure that no ones ever gonna talk to you its a terrible alternative so give in if you want to help yourself edit okay i was wrong i really should not have gotten this many upvotes i know no one is gonna see this since im editing after like a month but i was wrong talking to people helps so so much its just you gotta find the right people or you gotta build a friendship with someone to eventually be able to talk about your depression its true that forcing a smile on your face will probably help you to build these kind of friendships and its true its not a good idea express your depression to randoms just like that but i just want to say dont bottle up your feelings forever do what you must to create friendships with people that enable you to do this often forcing a smile helps for this but dont do this forever,post-pandemic
i actually felt suicidal today really and truly i havent told anyone i know and dont think i will ive found that being vulnerable with some of the people who im supposed to be closest with only gives them more ammunition to hurt me and the ones i do trust well i dont want to feel like a burden on them but it helped so much honestly maybe its kind of fake cuz its their job and theyre trained to be empathetic and understanding but it felt so good to have someone to listen and care to give a fucking shit that i am dying inside and so goddamn overwhelmed with almost all the aspects of my life i cried so so much i hid in the closet of my bedroom for some privacy and just poured my all my pain and worries out to the kind lady on the phone she comforted me and showed me kindness and concern and that felt so fucking good to just have someone listen she said shell call in again to check in on me and that feels nice please use the suicide prevention hotline i was teetering on the edge probably wasnt going to go through with it but i really genuinely wanted to be dead because life had just dealt me one too many blows and i couldnt stand up anymore thank you stranger now im gonna go binge movies and work,post-pandemic

this is something close to my heart and the reason for this is because i was someone who woke up one day and just couldnt recognise the person i was becoming i hated everything that my life was turning into i used to wake up 5 minutes before i had to leave to go to work slap some makeup on the train and run my fingers through my hair to comb iti felt as though i was like some dead zombie just walking around i never went outi stopped caring about how i was dressing how i looked and how rude i was to people so how did i get here well i think it was due to a series of disappointments and let downs life is just bullshit really it really is so what i did one day was i woke up and i just said thats it ive had enough im taking back the control so i quit the job i hated and just took one big risk leap i saw it as me jumping ship onto the floaty i started a little challenge whereby i would try and do things differently everyday for 2 weeks things that i would never do buy or wear the first thing was i would start taking more care of myself so i started getting up every morning and blowdrying my hair like i was going to the emmys then i started doing all these skin care treatments to my face and body i saw a naturapath and i quit smoking i got acupuncture for the first time i went to a mud bath for the first time i started wearing makeup everyday which i never did and this one changed everything i started wearing high heels in the day time and as stupid as this may sound it really worked it changed everything in my life it had such a profound affect on everything i changed the way i was dressing and this changed the way people were reacted to me as soon as i woke up in the morning i would have this little routine where i would glam myself up and it made me feel amazing people saw me as having this amazing confidence which i didnt but it sure was growing and people would constantly come up to pay me compliments complete strangers really random things like i love that nail polish did i see you at the balenciaga show what do you do people started looking at me seeing me differently and the best thing about it all was i was having fun i was loving this new outlook this change of perspective i was loving that i was reconnecting with my femininity i felt like i was living and so i wanted to share this because it helped me try it people if youre sick of feeling like crap take control back do the stiletto apprenticeship challenge see how it changes your life i hope it can help you like it did me my collegue did this with her best friend who was going through a divorce they did it together and had a blast with it for two weeks they would set little challenges like they would wear nothing but big diamante earrings for 2 weeks or have a week where they would wear red lipstick,pre-pandemic

ive seen it so many times yet no one seems to point that out im talking about the attractive bias if you dont know what the fuck that is its basically like if youre attractive good looking people will feel happy around you they will want to talk with you hangout with you otherwise if youre ugly they will feel uncomfortable around you they will try their best to ignore you neglect you etc and its fucking everywhere at school at clubs workplaces and the scariest of all medical settings a doctor is less likely to misdiagnose you if youre attractive and if you think thats a lie search attractive bias in medical settings so yeah i will now tell the harsh truth maybe the reason why no one fucking listens to you is because youre ugly maybe the reason you dont have a lot of friends is because youre ugly maybe the reason you dont have a girlfriend is again because you are ugly it pisses me off so much that people just try to hide this fact saying things like its the personality that matters or everyone is beautiful when its clearly not the case why cant yall just accept the fact that if you look like crap youre gonna be treated like crap or maybe yall to dumb to see this or dont care ive lost all my friends after i reached puberty and got acne and shit maybe they were not real friends after all i need real friends but everyone only fucking cares about appearance no wonder im depressed aaaaaaaaaaaaa,post-pandemic

i was abused as a child abused into adulthood told i would never amount to anything worthwhile and tried anyway i achieved some things but at the cost of great debts and now i cant pay those debts student loans are a constant 100k stressor that i cant get rid of because i dont know how to navigate the world of interpersonal networking and getting a job in general i have no idea how it works or how people stay employed i have had to call in for pto to jobs multiple times because i couldnt find my keys now most of the time i stay in one little room of my house ive gotten used to sleeping on couches because i cant sleep in my own bed at night due to snoring which i cant sleep through i am strung out and on top of that apparently falling victim to whatever sickness too my moms mind im trying desperately to stay a safe person to be around but tonight while trying to work things out with one of my 3 oldest friends who i guess are no longer my friends and i dont have friends i got this line i miss the old you he was a good guy i cried for over 2 hours and im still crying now i am a 40 year old man i dont know what im supposed to do ive tried to be a good person and ive tried to change for other people im autistic among a bunch of other things and i beg my friends to tell me if im doing something wrong because if i did i didnt want to but i only get this as retaliation after a long time i dont know how to have friends the only person ive known in my whole life who would be there when things are really down is my wife but thats not enough people to avoid the actual psychological torture of isolation i dont know how to fix myself to the point being accepted as though i was not isolated from within isolation i dont have anything and im more valuable dead than alive financially im a financial anchor because i cant figure anything out and no one wants me anyway im going to die in debt and i see no way out because no matter who im dealing with the answer is tell someone else ive been falling for decades and there seems to be no bottom but tonight i was confronted with the idea with that id already lost much more than i thought and people just werent willing to tell me ive been a joke and ill always be a joke no one has ever really wanted a complete me they want a pacified pet and im not allowed to be human i am not wanted as a human with all my emotions people say be yourself but what they really mean is mask heavily and always because no one will ever like you for who you really are i want to die and am ready to die and tonight my wife asked if it would be okay to take me to an inpatient place and i dont know where it would be but we cant afford that every day the only reason i dont kill myself is because it would cause harm to her emotionally but every day i sit here in this hole doing nothing until she comes back because everything i do reminds me of the fact that no one else genuinely cares and what people want is for a different me to exist,post-pandemic

i 28f have been with my boyfriend 31m for over two years we own a home and have planned to spend our lives together a year ago my boyfriend decided to go on lexapro because he experiences what his doctor believed to be anxiety attacks once a month at the same time every month please also comment if youve ever heard of something like this the anxiety attacks have continued so his doctor wants him to get off the lexapro and see a psychiatrist to rule out anything going on with his brain because his doctor no longer believes hes experiencing anxiety attacks the downside is that the lexapro has a number of known side effects all of which he has been dealing with the past year since going on them there have been a lot of changes with his behavior and his personality since going on this medication which i have previously posted about when seeking guidance for how to best support him the most recent change is that he believes he no longer wants to have kids he thinks he doesnt want to have kids anymore he says he might change his mind in the future but right now he thinks he doesnt want them this is a complete 180 on his part we had the discussion about kids very early on in our relationship and he said he wanted them and would do whatever it took to be a dad ie ivf surrogacy etc he is also an uncle and is amazing with his nieces and nephews even as recent as 6 months ago he was talking about looking forward to having kids with me as a symptom of his depression he doesnt want to do anything anymore so this change doesnt completely surprise me and is part of the reason im hesitant to fully believe it at the same time i want to make it clear i would never pressure him into doing something he doesnt want to do if he doesnt want kids i wont have kids with him what im trying to figure out is if this medication can be contributing to this sudden change before i decide what i want to do i love kids my entire career revolves around kids i have always wanted to be a mom with that said ive shared some of his doubts about that major life change such as finances the state of our world stress etc however i still come out wanting to be a mom and so did he until recently i now have to decide what i want to do with this information i dont want to discredit him but there have been so many changes since hes gone on lexapro that its hard to tell whats real and whats the lexapro has anyone faced these changes as a result of depressionanxiety or ssris,post-pandemic

june is mens mental health month have you noticed that nobody else has posted about it but if it was about women will be a whole different story i bet half the men look at this ive never heard june as mens mental health month because i guess its not as important as pride month 1 man every 60 seconds 1440 men a day 77 of all suicides are men and sometimes i stay silent because nobody cares i dont tell people my problems anymore because nobody can fix them what are they going to do tell me it ok when its notthey tell me they understand when they dont and i dont like who i am theres nothing good about me anymore im sick of wasting my time im wore out im really tired i dont know what happened to me and all i want is to be happy again like when i was a kid and had no worries people ask why did you stop smiling your smile used to lite up rooms youre joy was infectious it used to ripple through crowds you where the embodiment of mirth and cheerfulness an oasis of happiness in a world that often seems shrouded in gloom i remember youre eyes twinkling with the secret promise of a joke youre lips always curled upwards in anticipation of laughter i remember your energy how it seeped into the air making the world seem a little brighter a little better i tell them the world weight was to much the demands of life the pursuit of dreams the battle against the clock stole my joy i wish i could tell them i was ok that my happiness matters that my smile is missed i wish i could theyll them to hold on to their laughter not to let the world dull there spark i tell them to take a pause and take time to breathe and relax its ok to step back from the race to find your joy again make a beacon for those lost in the chaos because the world needs your light your laughter your joy,post-pandemic

i was depressed failing school etc and i decided i should do my homework at a coffee shop one day i went in and the owner was super nice and asked me if i wanted to join the rewards program and i was really craving community at this point and i was super excited i kept coming back to the shop to do my homework and the owner and the baristas would always welcome me and they were always happy to see me i started to get to know everybody there very well and now i consider them all friends i found that when depressed having different communities helps a lot and it turns out a lot of the other regulars at coffee shops also are depressed or have other mental illnesses a two dollar drink can let you stay there for a few hours and by being nice to everyone around you and being somewhat productive on work it can be a really great place to have,pre-pandemic

im starting to think that depression is just a fake symptom that i am putting blame on nowadays everyone claims to be depressed i dont even know if its real or not anymore there is no known mechanism neurologically hormonally physically etc that causes it it is a set of symptoms that the doctors have agreed are worth writing prescriptions for its not even a rigid set of symptoms the way to test is by asking verbal questions then the answers the patient gives are open to interpretation im sure some of us have been tested before the answers they score low and high on dont matter its just an aggregate over all questions in the verbal test i think depression might be total baloney i hope that if i never associate with it again and forget about it it wont exist in my head anymore,pre-pandemic

i think that church is great and all and its definitely the true religion i am by no means thinking of leaving but its my church that can make me feel depressed i have never moved church so a few of the people have known me all of my life i dont know if its because of this but im definitely considered popular in my church im very grateful that people like me and all but i feel that there are also a lot more strict expectations of me than the other kids my age i know i sound super narcissistic about myself but im just saying it how it is and i would never lie about something like this there are some people from church who are popular but there are some that could easily lead a double life if they wanted to and there are others that you dont see in months the popular ones literally cant miss a service without everyone asking about them but i dont know why people are so drawn to me though i dont know wether its because im friendly or under 18 or what but they seem to really like me i was with some friends a few months back and they were saying that it was ok to go against some of our beliefs i was shocked but i also felt like they could just do that and get away with it and if people from church found out they would be a little disappointed but get over it quickly i feel like if i did anything like that though it would make people really upset and they would start having chats with me etc so that did make me wonder also quite recently one of my teachers at school started speaking badly about christians to the whole class the next lesson i asked for a word with the teacher and politely told them that what they said wasnt true and they apologised afterwards and all that straight after school i immediately told my parents and grandparents and they were so happy with me however the whole church found out and they were also happy im glad that i made them feel happy but i feel like it was also the last nail in the coffin for this squeaky clean image i cant break free from i know it sounds stupid but i feel like i need to please them a lot and always be on my best behaviour also a lot of people from other churches know about me and i know people from my church have told others about me i know that they mean well but i just feel like i will never really be able to do what i want in life instead of being a people pleaser and sometimes it makes me feel depressed that my life has been like a puppet on strings always doing what others expect of me sometimes just thoughts on how people will be disappointed if i did the slightest thing depress me because i just feel like im living my life for an audience im not exaggerating because even my parents agree with me also i often think about what i would be like and what i could do if i didnt go to church but i still want to go because im doing it for god and not for anyone else i also wonder why none of my friends are treated like this at church also if anyone else has had a similar experienceknows why people treat me like that i would be very grateful if you share it,post-pandemic

34f ive struggled with my mental health since as long as i can remember i believe it began when i was molested by a friend of my mother step father when i reached out to a friend to explain what had happened to me it was reported to school but not the police no clue why i remember my mother bringing me to a therapist but staying in the room the whole time i wasnt allowed to get the help i needed my mother made me lie to the school and the therapist saying i made everything up i did because i was afraid of hermentally physically abusive alcoholic because of all of that i am afraid to trust any professional i still dont understand how my mother was able to manipulate everyone involved that i made it all up i remember the smell of his shitty cologne the coors can that was left on my dresser and having to scrub blood out of my underwear the next morning because i was afraid to tell anyone what happened it had to have been my fault in some way at least thats what i felt at the timei started cutting my wrists thighs and carving words into my legs a few attemps of overdosing on my mothers pills i repressed the memories of being molested and abuse from my mother learned to deal with my mental healthpoorlyon my own without a therapist and never told another soul about what happened not even my husband fast forward to my first pregnancy i had ppd with my 1st child but it turned into something so different for me mentally feeling like i was outside my body running on auto pilot constant need of praise or some kind of encouragement that i was worth living i struggled to talk about any of my feelings even with my husband huge mistake i wanted to pretend the thoughts werent there and i managed to convince myself in some ways that i was okay mentally in the mix of all of that i let another man into my life not physically in anyway huge issues with men putting their hands on me in anyway because of my past but he flirted with me at work alot and it got to the point where i flirted back it became an emotional affair i remember wanting to feel desirable and appreciated i needed an escape from my thoughts never in a million years would i have thought i could do anything like that but i did and i will never be able to forgive myself for it i should have brought up my past with my husband at that point at least to try to make him understand that i could never cross that line physically but i never did i still fucked everything up by even talking to someone else so would it have even mattered most recently my husband brought up a time where i was pregnant with our second child where i apparently got in my car drove into the yard and said i was going to kill myself i have literally no memory of any of that my question is what type of mental illness can cause memory loss to that point it clearly was a huge event in my life but why cant i remember it hearing about this pushed me into looking for help is it similar to other repressed memories i have i feel so lost and am terrified of remembering more about my past i still havent been able to bring myself to talk to a professional so i havent been officially diagnosed with anything i have alot of the same signs for borderline personality disorder depersonalizationderealization disorder and dissociative identity disorder i dont know where to even start with getting help because of how paranoid i am about talking with a therapist,post-pandemic
people are not allowed to motivate you to better yourself get out of your current situation they cannot offer you any kind of solution or potential way to go about helping you in your depression hard time you are not allowed to comfort or aid people in their thoughts instead youre supposed to support them offering nothing to the situation and only offering attention ultimately unable to help the person struggling and just giving them an echo chamber isolating them its sad really everyone comes here sad and leaves here sad as there are no ways to aid people youre better off going to rsuicidewatch if you want to talk about depression i wouldnt be surprised if i got downvoted to hell or post removed by a mod who realizes this hits a little too close to home,pre-pandemic
this pattern has been repeating for over a decade for me i dont still have any friends from then now hell i barely have any friends left from 5 years ago im just so sick of it i thought id broken this cycle but its rearing its head again im being told to just make new friends but what happens a couple of years from now when they get sick of me too and im right back here wallowing in my own feelings of abandonment isolation not belonging etc all over again it just reinforces for me that i dont belong on this planet that as soon as somebody knows the real me our relationship whatever its nature is on borrowed time that im just going to be flitting like a pariah between groups i never quite seem to fit into spending the rest of my life pursuing validation wherever the search takes me next until finally almost mercifully it ends justwhy bother if nobody can love me for the real me and i cant for the life of me mould myself into a shape they can accept whats the point edit thanks for the silver guys i wasnt expecting this to be so well received,pre-pandemic

so im a 17 yearold brit i was diagnosed with depression earlier this year but have felt depressed for years i plan on running away as soon as i hit 18 in 3 months i know that its not technically running away in the typical sense as ill be an adult and ill leave my parents a note i have around 9000 in savings from the job i got when i dropped out which i figure is enough to support me for a couple of months in either europe canada or australia im doing this because i cant cope here anymore i blame me feeling like shit constantly on england my family and my friends so i figure the best course of action is to cut them all out so what do you think stupid idea or will it help,pre-pandemic
okay so there was a festival at my town and this girl i knew from school ask if i wanted to join and i said yea and we had a very fun night and we kinda of flirted a little but when i got home and ask her if we should talk more at school she said for sure we can talk we can be friends this just made me shut down and im sad and idk what to do with myself i just feel lonely even though im very funny nice and respectful just feel sad and nothing is cheering me up what should i do,post-pandemic
i understand that everyone here has the best intentions but 90 of the posts are severely depressed people moping about how awful their lives are this isnt going to help anyone when youre depressed at least this is what its like for me there is this voice inside of you that convinces you of how shitty and hopeless your life is this is the voice that is writing so many of the posts on this subreddit reading about other peoples supposed shitty lives is not going to help you get better constantly reading about others and worrying about yourself and reevaluating your own life is not how you get out of this all youre doing is reaffirming to yourself that you wont improve for me a day spent browsing reddit left me feeling like absolute shit i dont want to sound like i have everything figured out and this is the magical cure its just what i found to be true i spent time surrounding myself with positive things and people which has helped me tremendously just distracting my mind from all this shit and focusing on things other than myself and depression was huge for me,pre-pandemic
i dont mean just general regret for your life choices i mean seriously annoyed with every thought you have or the state of your living place or even banal things like the way your clothes fit or how your hair is hanging that day i dont know i guess im just frustrated enough to bury my head in a pillow and give up on the day again,pre-pandemic

ive been really stubborn about seeing someone for my chronic depression but for a while now my meds just havent been helping and i started spiraling out of control getting the energy to see someone about it besides my gp has been tough im sure you know the feeling of being sure that your problems are pointless and not worth speaking about and burdening someone with them haha through pressuring from my so im trying to make the attempt to see a psychologist anyway i had my second appointment with my therapist today and we did a really great activity that appealed to me a lot i want to pass it on to people who also have a hard time speaking to someone about their depression but could use a new and creative coping strategy i think its a great tactic for very creative people to use like artists and writers and visual thinkers so think of yourself like the captain of a ship imagine your boat imagine yourself behind the wheel imagine the ocean youre sailing through depending on how deep you are in your depression you might be close to land or far out in the deep sea on this boat are your monsters the feelings and thoughts you most frequently have personified whenever you start to feel a depressive episode those monsters try to take control of the ship they try to distract you from sailing towards your goals in life their goal is to overwhelm you totally so you let go of the wheel give up and drift forever into the sea in the activity i had to describe and name the worst and most familiar monsters on my ship the ones that were created from my most horrible and frequent doubts what did they look like what did they smell like what did they whisper to me and how did it affect me i had to give them a name and personify them and then i had to come up with an idea of how to banish them off my boat so i could continue steering i imagined had two really nasty monsters on my boat which was sailing through the arctic ice burgs one was huge and long and sinuous with hundreds of arms like a centipede it was completely black with no eyes and a gaping hungry mouth with neon green dripping insides it had rings of saw like teeth going into its body he was scary and intelligent and malevolent he had the consistency of oil and reeked of petrol and what he said to me was give up youve lost your ambitions youll never get to the place you want in life youll never be successful youve lost your chance just give up we decided that the way to destroy it was to set it on fire its made of oil and petrol after all right and petrol is used as fuel fuel for my desires and motivations so setting it alight was this sort of cathartic and ironic way to reclaim my ambitions i had another monster a huge leviathan that came up from the deep sea underneath my ship to try and swallow me it was mindbogglingly massive like an eldritch whale it was my because of your upbringing your poverty the abuse you suffered youll never have the headstart and the privilege that others better off have and youll never have those experiences of safety youll never be able to succeed when there are others out there that are better than you it was an angry violent envious monster the way i fought it was shooting a harpoon down its throat like my moby dick but we decided that it was simply to big to kill it was too powerful id always have it lurking close to me a shadow just under the water so we could belittle it make it small trap it like a fish in a tank others have it so much more worse than me and they do incredible things i have a home and food and shelter if they can succeed so can i as you can see i really got into it it put some of my worst thoughts out there into a creature that was almost tangible instead of just ugly horrible feelings that i often couldnt understand or come to grips with it made them less scary and more familiar and mine i can say hey crippling doubt and inadequacy how are you today you look so cute and get on with my life it was fun to create these ideas and then realize that what i decided to make them out of made them easily fightable like the snake monster made of flammable liquid the ways to defeat them seemed suddenly really clear and easy as an artist im considering drawing out these ideas and characters to really make them tangible a little like an art therapy thing maybe expand out my other issues into monsters as well i thought for similar visual creative people like me this might help you tackle your own monsters because i feel like putting these feelings at a distance and giving them an identity makes it easier to understand and define and battle them,pre-pandemic

after 34 of a bottle of pinot grigio i decided to take my one woman pity party outside i let the rain fall on my face i let it soak my sweater i walked down the middle of the street while the pavement shimmered in front of me i stood by the water while black waves rolled towards my feet and the wind blew rain into my face i held my arms out and let the wind blow across my body i waked through the park i got on a swing in the playground and let my legs take me as high as i could like when i was a kid i spun in the middle of the street while water got in my boots and soaked my socks i fucking skipped down the middle of the street in the rain without a soul around and i know i will eventually fall asleep and tomorrow will crush me like every other day but i really felt alive tonight for a little while you guys sorry for the theatrics the pinot is still working its magic happy tuesday edit just wanted to say how moved i am by other people sharing their similar experience or saying that this post made them feel happy or comforted as hard as it is to believe sometimes we all deserve to feel that way today was as hard as any other day but i know somewhere i have the capacity to feel better we all do,pre-pandemic

depression its that topic we dont like to talk about particularly when it comes to ourselves ive been living with depression for about ten years now and those of you who know what its like know that the struggle is real depression for me took on a new level when i became a mum for the first time then a second time and then again a third time i wish i could say that 90 of my days were great and only 10 were down days but unfortunately that is not my reality nor the reality for many others out there living with depression is hard living with depression as a parent well for me it often feels like mission impossible i love my kids more than anything in this world but sometimes its scary its scary because there are days where i feel so down and so helpless that i think about the relief i would feel if i was miraculously not to wake in the morning depression has a way of weakening you and it can take every ounce of your being to get back on your feet i have long accepted the fact that depression is a part of my life and that trying my best is all i can ever do loving my children with all my heart and supporting them in every way i am able is all i can ever do these days im very much pro counseling meaning im all for seeking help both professional and nonprofessional ive seen numerous counselors over the years and based on my own experiences i can say that there is real power in talking about your feelings along with any thoughts that may be troubling you i absolutely recommend giving it a go if you havent already or even if you have being on a pharmaceutical regimen has and continues to help me but as you may already know there is no cure for depression i wish there was my kids and i dont live by a lot of structure why well i feel life can easily become rigid mundane and lack spontaneity but mostly its because i find the idea of maintaining a routine daunting and stressful there are definitely times where i think my family and i could benefit from more routine but then i remember the feeling of failure when i dont complete a task on time and having my time stretched between three children under four years old not completing tasks on time happens a lot being a nature lover with a more free range parenting style helps keep the stress levels down too so for us its one day at a time and we take it as it comes i acknowledge that we all strive in different environments and to that i say whatever works for you and makes you happy my top four things to do to boost positivity 1 get out of the house if its nice enough weather go for a walk if its not go for a drive this is what i do with the kids and it always makes me feel like ive done something productive with my day plus its like a little adventure for the kids each time 2 make something really healthy to eatdrink ive never been much of a comfort eater instead if im feeling crap i like to have something really healthy to eatdrink i suppose in a way i do it in spite of my feeling crap always feeling at least a little bit better afterwards for doing something good for my body as a parent im trying to do this all the time with my kids but as we know they can be fussy little buggers and id be lying if i said i never felt discouraged when they choose not to eat something i tried so hard to make for them this happens often something that does work more often than not though is smoothiesjuices we use a nutrininja which does a good job at making these for us 3 visual inspiration i find having something to look at often helps it needs to be specific though it cant be one of those signs that tells you to laugh often i find these type of quotes only amplify my negative emotions by reminding me of what im not doing enough of without providing a solution 4 freshen uppamper yourself have a shower shave pluck those eyebrows do a face mask take a minute from chasing after the kids for yourself just like eating healthy makes us feel good about our insides grooming ourselves often makes us feel good about our outsides x200b if you have any questions or stories to share id love to hear from you x200b let me tell you something you already know the world aint all sunshine and rainbows its a very mean and nasty place and i dont care how tough you are it will beat you to your knees and keep you there permanently if you let it you me or nobody is gonna hit as hard as life but it aint about how hard you hit its about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward how much you can take and keep moving forward thats how winning is done now if you know what youre worth then go out and get what youre worth but you gotta be willing to take the hits and not pointing fingers saying you aint where you wanna be because of him or her or anybody cowards do that and that aint you youre better than that sylvester stallone rocky balboa aka my hero,pre-pandemic

first i killed the athlete there wasnt much of him to begin with so it was easy at the least he tried to give an effort to materialize during my college days he even joined some after school group of friends to play with that didnt really go anywhere next i killed the gamer he was easy to kill too because of the need the corporate life taking much of my time didnt leave enough breathing room for him to keep up a fight his antics still surface every now and then making me wish for adventures and the blood pumping suspense or action of his previous endeavors i just stuffed his mouth with career dreams he didnt really struggle as he believed that to asphyxiate was actually reasonable next i killed the party boy this one took a little bit more orchestration than the previous two i had to kill his connections with his friends i had to starve him of his former social saturation and in a way that he wont easily recourse back i made his friends believe he didnt need the contact that he was happy the party boy slowly lost his spirit thats when i went for the jugular to end his pain next i killed the musician i almost didnt like killing him hes the most recent one and the most difficult one to get rid of he has support your see all the feelings and emotions closing through him everytime he hears plays or sings a song gives him enough strength to push back hes even made a solid group of friends that push and pull him to their graces but an opening came in the guise of leaving the country that tiny waver in his resolve let me sneak in a stab it was easy enough from then on im just afraid that eventually i might kill the writer too and when i do i dont really know whats left im actually surprised to realize that ive been hurting myself without physically doing so ive lost more of myself in the past few months than i ever had in years and im not making any more of me than what i already have ps i wrote this to myself at a bad time about a year ago and putting what ive been doing in words has surprisingly help me curb and slowly regain myself throughout the past year i still get spans of time where i feel like nothing where i feel afraid of being nothing that id rather just lose my life but remember all youve been through things may not feel the best now but you are not worthless you matter theres a value to everything youve done and accomplished so lets all hold on and hold tight edit thank you so much for giving my first gold kind stranger and to everybody whos commenting i wish i had more time to reply to all of you im surprised with the turnout and even more with how people feel the same and areis going through losing parts of themselves lets all keep holding on to those and try our best not to lose more than we do and for those who feel empty its never too late to find yourself lets all fight for it even if it starts with just getting up from your bed in the morning,pre-pandemic

antidepressants efficacy is in practice close to placebo and yet some few get subjective benefits but also some get devastating permanent damages the majority eats an unhealthy substance thinking they need it but all it does is nothing or side effects for instance on ssris and snris its assumed and studied that around 70 of users get some level of sexual dysfunction during use and for some these get severe and permanent this includes often total emotional numbness and loss of pleasure there are studies showing better efficacy than placebo too but even european medicine agency representative agreed in a tv intrerview that the typical number to treat for antidepressants is around ten 110 gets clear benefit no other medication will be allowed with such efficacy rate yet massive list of risks,pre-pandemic

unfortunately we live in a time where nationality still matters in most places regardless of how open and connected the world is trying to become and depending on which country and environment you were born in it determines a lot of things about early life and social acceptance in the world i was not one of the lucky people that were born in countries such as the united states japan germany or canada and although i am not saying that people always have it better there but the social standards and international opportunities they have are definitely way above some poor and useless countries from eastern europe middle east or central africa where life direction is uncertain and the main motivation is to escape somewhere else i was born in a small and useless country from eastern europe in a wrong environment of uneducated people and never had motivation for anything in life which lead into messing up high school and getting a useless bachelors degree in a subject i didnt care about the only thing that i had interest in was someday going to japan to study or do something else productive there it was only after i finished the useless bachelor that i understood the actual degree that i wanted but due to the past mistakes and life directions and because of the wrong environment and people almost all the doors have been closed now since it is almost impossible to be admitted into a university in japan and also my country is unimportant internationally and noone would take it seriously while people who were born in germany or the us even if they mess up their life and drop out of school they still have many other opportunities and routes to be accepted in japan or in general obtain their degrees and move on but for us one mistake and it is over i feel like i am being punished daily for coming from the wrong place and seeing that most people here are already born in prestigious countries mainly the us makes posts like this even harder because most advices come from americans who have it way better than us in the first place i just want to leave this stupid place and study abroad even if i have to take another undergraduate degree i cant stay here anymore and honestly seeing all the illegal immigrants from the middle east or mexico swarming the important countries makes them completely justified from my viewpoint because its not their fault that they were born in the wrong place,pre-pandemic
some days im pretty okay well not really okay its just that theres enough time for me to anaesthetize myself on netflix video games and other shit that doesnt do anything for me it keeps my mind off of things it keeps my mind off of trying to kill myself its pretty much exactly like taking painkillers you know youre not okay and you know the pain will come back no matter what but what matters is that in that moment youre managing to not feel anything and that in itself is a massive fucking success,pre-pandemic
yesterday i went to a clinic because of my injured leg while i was talking to my doctor about my injury suddenly i had an urge to talk about what ive been feeling for the past 5 years it took a lot of courage since i never talked to any adults about it because i was too anxious and scared i cried my hands were shaking and i couldnt really talk properly but what i knew was i finally seek a proper treatment i knew i was depressed and the doctor diagnosed me with it im only 18 years old this year and im currently studying at college right now im embarrassed when i remember the way i broke down in front of the doctor but i did i finally talked,post-pandemic

ive developed a habit of saying depressive thoughts out loud bc im always alone always thinking them and talk to myself when no ones looking its reached the point where instead of saying fuck when something goes wrong ill say i want to kill myself its become so engrained in my mind that ive come close to accidentally saying these when other people are around anyone else do this,pre-pandemic
3 months ago i found porn on my s0s phone m 19and i f19 consistently had conversations about how i felt about it it makes me uncomfortable i dont care if he watches it but it still makes me feel depressed and miserable i think it makes me upset because porn sets standards how sex should be and even how one should look porn has made me really insecure about my body when we have sex and i know porn isnt meant to do this and im not saying its wrong for anyone to like it its just not my thing i just want to feel beautiful without worrying about how i look when i have sex with my so my so always talks about new things he wants to do in the bedroom and i feel like its ideas from porn i just want our sex life to be separate from porn i dont want to feel like i am doing certain things because he saw it on porn and it really turned him on i want to create our own ideas i want to have sex our way without pressure of doing something wrong its been a challenge and 2 months later i cant seem to feel any better about it even when my so assures me that i am beautiful and porn is nothing compared to me i suffer from depression ive self harmed before and i have low confidence and self esteem i honestly just want someone to relate or understand how i feel and not just say that im stupid for feeling this way it would make me feel a lot better and less alone with this perspective is this a unreasonable feeling update im still having a hard time getting over this i would appreciate some more comments on this problem,pre-pandemic

the most probable reason youre depressed is because you dont know who you are you dont know what you stand for you dont know who you want to become you dont know what you want out of life and when you dont know these things youre basically running around like a headless chicken like a feather in the wind so the main i want you to do is to get clear on who you are what you stand for and what you want to become once you start working towards the person you want to become youll totally forget about that thing called depression best of luck,post-pandemic

no special occasion i just had a tough day at work so i picked up a big bunch of tulips on the way home not the cheap ones either but the lovely fresh perfectly blooming crisp and colorful kind whats the big deal youre probably thinking the big deal is that there was a time in the not so distant past that the thought of treating myself to anything just because filled me with guilt shame and self loathing you dont deserve it its too good for you youre not worth the timeeffortmoney you are nothing and you have nothing to offer so you deserve nothing in return so now i really appreciate any small act of kindness i afford myself yes there are still days that i force myself to have a cold shower in the morning just because i hate it i love cooking delicious food for other people but i still sometimes eat instant noodles when im alone and having a bad day because its a waste of time to cook just for me but today i showed myself a little kindness i acknowledged the fact that i work damn hard and i am great at my job i have value and i am valued tulips are beautiful and so am i i deserve to have beautiful things in my life because i am a badass bitch edit wow thank you everybody honestly i didnt expect much of a response to this i was just giving myself a little pat on the back for not being a dick to myself for once lol im so happy it put a little smile on a few faces and even happier if it reminded even one of you wonderful people to be a little kinder to yourself youre all awesome and to the lovely stranger who gave me gold thank you from the bottom of my heart for that it was a nice surprise to wake up to this morning and put a little pep in my step today,pre-pandemic

anyone experiencing any degree of happiness confidence or social success deserves to have it violently and tragically ripped away from them the fact that other people experience hope loving relationships and friends who care about them makes me deeply hate everyone around me fuck them for passing me by every day choosing to pursue connections with literally anyone but me humanity does nothing but treat me like a worthless piece of shit so i guess thats all i am edit for context i am in therapy and have tried medication i have been in treatment for a few years neither have been able to do anything for me,post-pandemic

ive been sick nauseous vomiting etc maybe its that flu thats going around in any case i forgot to take my paxil for three days as ive been recovering feeling much better thank you my sexual interest has returned i guess i got all the paxil out of my system the orgasms are just incredible is it really worth giving up all sexual interest for a little less anxiety i mean seriously it used to take me a long time to get off with paxil it took forever no joke hours and the orgasm felt okay but not great the difference is astounding the idiot doctors act like this is no big deal i think its a residual notion that the mentally ill must be punished in some way fuck this shit a pill thats supposed to make you feel better only it takes away your orgasms makes food taste bland and makes everything in your life seem bleh great job i really doubt these fucking pills do anything actually and when i complain they just up the dosage fuck you psychiatry youre not even a science youre just a fucking halfwit religion,pre-pandemic
ive been struggling with my mental health lately most recently i havent been feeling good about myself i think its due to low confidence and a lack of appreciation for myself but i been dealing with the right way to express myself sexually and i think im also kinda confused on how i feel as a person i dont really know my sexualityi guess i flip flop from wanting to feel masculine and feminine im a woman but i think me wanting to feel masculine comes from insecurities of dating women that i know like men im dating a bi woman now and its very hard for me to regulate my emotions in the relationship i find myself not feeling im enough at times due to the fact that maybe im not masculine enough or dominant and she is very attracted to both of these things so i get all in my head about if im doing a good job or not ive created this narrative in my head that shes going leave one day because of this so i push her away even though she says she loves me it just always feels like shes missing out on something the way she glorifies how much men are attractive and her type of guy also the fact that she has all these amazing sex stories with this guy and im horrible at sex lol and how she wants a baby one day and her sex fantasy is a threesome with two dudes i like i let those things linger in my brian too much theyve taken control of me so i sit and overthink everything all day long i just dont want to plan a future with someone i dont feel safe with but the love i have for her is so strong im lost,post-pandemic

i know i cant take matters into my own hands because my dad mom and grandma would quickly follow so thats basically murder at that point then my friends who are mainly all longdistance at this point gasoline for the fire of my depression would blame themselves and be stuck with that trauma forever thats a life sentence of misery for people who love me in a healthier and more supportive way than my own parents do my boyfriend would also blame himself he hasnt been making much time for me whatsoever at all though so he is certainly not helping he doesnt know at all how bad my mental health is to be fair but man if i got terminal cancer thats nobodys fault everyone would grieve maybe in some capacity forever but they could only be angry at the chaos of the universe not themselves i know its sick to want that when countless families are tormented by it daily but if there was a way to give my health to someone who was terminally ill and take their sickness and die from it i wouldnt think twice im around 80k in debt all in collections because i was financially abused by my ex i have a boyfriend i adore but have only been seeing a few times a month he says it will get better when he gets a house and settles into his new job and doesnt have his family ordering him around but im running out of strength to withstand it my mom is extremely abusive because of her npd and always has been and thats confusing as hell because she loves me so much but its also as easy as breathing for her to be horrifically cruel to me her emotions dictate my entire life right now my dad is depressed and unable to leave his abusive girlfriend who hates my guts hes also in financial hardship im also fucking autistic and i spent the past two years caretaking for my cruel and psychotic morbidly obese aunt who hallucinated and shat herself in our shared bathroom just for my mom to kick her out a few months ago all i have going for me is my looks even my intelligence hasnt been of much use to me because my autism makes me nave and people just use me then my looks make people want to use me more i cant even count how many rapeattempts ive narrowly escaped my biggest fear is that next time i wont get away id rather just be killed one of my main ways to deal with the emotional pain is to go online and genuinely compliment people usually other women otherwise i will starve myself pull out my hair bash my head against the wall or furiously smack myself classic autistic meltdown style as a consequence of the first coping mechanism i now have a decent collection of online mutuals who adore me and check up on me daily i feel like i do things that make it impossible for me to off myself but i still fantasize about it constantly its madness i hate how most of my love is online i havent hugged my best friend in korea since the night before she left in august then i cried so hard i almost threw up on the train because she was the one friend in my city i saw regularly modern life is so fucking sad and im financially ruined so i cant even afford a few hundred dollars to go stay with my best friend in vancouver for a few days she tried to come here but i couldnt even get two days off work i try i try so hard to live a normal healthy life and i grasp and grasp and it all just turns to shit in my hands i know that subconsciously my bf sees me as a burden because i dont have friends i go out with after work like a normal 20something he doesnt care about the money thing but i know him being my main social life bothers him im friends with my colleagues but two of them have kids and the other one is like 21 and im 28 i see people going out in groups and doing things offline together and i feel so embarrassed and weird i have a lot of friends ive worked really hard on building those relationships but they are in vancouver and miami and incheon korea and goddamn sydney australia my daytoday is mainly walking on eggshells around my mom and even if i do everything right if shes due for a blowup she will blow up at me and it could happen at any time im going insane my heart starts racing when i hear her footsteps coming up the stairs and im fucking 28 its just like when i was a child again and the finances are keeping me trapped and she keeps asking for more money and i do owe her its hell im already in hell,post-pandemic
as a chronic suicidally depressed individual i find myself gatekeeping if i cant look in your eyes and see that you wake up and go to bed every night wanting it all to end your depression dont mean shit to me sure ill say some encouraging words try and bring you out of whatever youre going through but you aint got a single idea of my mind my life i hate to see my friends going through anything close to what i do every damn day i dont want to listen about your problems i dont want to hear about your minor crap that has you down today double mortgage problems your unicorn broke up with you and your wife come back to me when youre barely making life work through blood sweat and tears on your damn own hating every aspect of life and existence its a mixed bag of feelings none of it healthy and i feel like shit about it but cant deny feeling this way in the first place dont know what to do with it,post-pandemic
i literally dont want to do anything at all it doesnt bring me any happiness or joy or whatever at best just distracts me from feeling shitty absolutely nothing helps video games writing reading doing photography drawing none of that makes me happy its the absolute fucking worst i dont even feel like sleeping but i dont wanna be awake either i go to bed before 7pm because i have nothing else i wanna do all i do is lie in bed and listen to miserable songs and cry then i go to sleep wake up and repeat i hate living i hate this existence i wish i could just die in my sleep edit this got a lot more attention than i thought so i just wanna day that im reading all your comments and i love you all,pre-pandemic
so i went to a bar last night with a girl and a guy friend of mine i have been interested in this girl for a while and she has been kind of flirty with me as well but also kind of flirty with everyone for that matter anyway at one point when my guy friend was making a phone call i asked her why are women so i dunno not interested and she replied with listen my experience has been that i can treat you like crap because i can get away with it or you can leave i sat there stunned for a minute and after getting back to my car at another bar i just left women shouldnt act like pigs and shouldnt be so mean me and her arent friends anymore at this point because of what she said last night and at this point i dont have very many friends left in town,pre-pandemic
to start this off ive dealt with depression for as long as i can remember and for awhile i was doing really well for myself i was in the gym doing well in school and had a girlfriend for the first time in forever now another thing to note i dont hate her im not mad at her nor do i have any ill feelings towards her personally so a few months ago i found out how she lost her virginity and i also found out it was 2 weeks before we met and this hurt to hear and i raised the issue but she took it personally so i just left it every since then my mental health has been on a steep decline shes noticed too and until recently i had no idea why a few days ago i realized i was thinking about how she lost her virginity a lot and how vivid the scene was in my head it just makes me so sad to imagine the person i love more than anything else like that its been getting worse and i cant handle it this is the first time ive genuinely considered suicide i dont wanna talk to her about it because she already regrets it and i dont wanna make her feel guilty and regret it more so im saying it here now ik its so childish but its seriously messing with my mental health and the fact that i have to live with this forever is so painful to me,post-pandemic
i told my dad that my therapist told me that when im going through stressful periods of my life i get depressednot a severe depression but like a mild one and he literally only said ok and when my mom tried to get more of a reaction out of him because she saw that i was hurt he said did you not hear me i just said ok yay thanks dad i bet im not the only one with a dad thats not emotionally there for you,post-pandemic
every now and then i see some person being visibly depressed at the venue party or some place like visually upset they dont even try to hide this when you talk to them the very first thing they tell you is basically how lonely and horny they are like the first thing im the biggest hater i know i hate my life not having friends and everything but this is just way too much to me its rude impolite spoiled and just pathetic there is no dignity in that,post-pandemic

im sure most of us have a difficult time during the holidays i would happily submit to medically induced sleep from about october to march if the holidays are difficult for you and bring on your depression try to stay around friends be around people that make you feel good but then i become codependent and when i am alone i crush my own soul seems the most humane and simple solution would be to just check out till spring hell the animals do it i vote for hibernation any other cowards with me,pre-pandemic
ive lost interest in finding friends it hurts me a lot when my og friends from college starts ignoring me when they found a new better friend than me never talked to me anymore nor call me i wish i have a friend that i could talk personally to idk what to do anymore didnt expect growing up would be this fkn hurt im clinging to games and music to run away from all the problems i had i need someone to hug me and say its all gonna be okay guess some things are just too good to be true,pre-pandemic

i am an adult now but when i was a freshman at 14 i was 6 tall and had a deep voice i looked like i was 18 at least i met one older girl because she eavesdropped into my conversations and then laughed loudly at a joke she clearly heard me make then asked me to repeat it to her then after i talked to her her and her friend wait after class for me so she can pop out and say boo and smile at me and she got in my face to do so then she began laughing at dumb stuff i say to other people butting into my conversations responding to me or asking me to repeat stuff to her she couldnt look me in the eyes and say hi first at first her friend girl 2 didnt talk to me and she just pushed me to the first one while talking to me 1 would get red and make no eye contact hide her face and didnt stand still she blushed and smiled when i say hi first then her friend asked me to be around them and she was embarrassed and had an attitude but 1 wanted me as close as possible to her and talked to me as much as possible she scared me after i talked to her and she got my attention then she had her friend come and get me for a selfie when she dressed up and wore something showing cleavage 1 asked for a picture with me when i talked to her and for me to get close to her she found any way she could to compliment me and approached me with her friend next to her they both laughed at everything found any excuse to be around me and talk 2 offered me a ride when it wasnt necessary theyd both give me no space smile and make eye contact laugh at dumb stuff i said theyd get in my face trying to talk to me then follow me around find any excuse to be around me and as close as possible compliment me a lot theyd talk in a tone with me or talk in a higher pitched voice theyd giggle and say my name or say youve been really innappropriate recently when i did something bad defend me and stick up for me when some guys were picking on us the second one stood up for us one of them wont leave me alone now,pre-pandemic

i feel tired all the time i dont feel happy very often i have thought about killing myself but have never had the balls to do it my life feels pointless and i hate the world recently its been getting worse due to the fact that i have been put into foster care and i miss my mum and step dad my social worker shouts at me constantly and has even said to me and my little brother who is eleven that the reason we were being taken away was that she was trying to kill herself wich wasnt true when i was younger my parents would always fight i would get pinned down by teachers every day at school eventually my parents split up and we moved away from our old house away from my father it was better where than it was but it still sucked the nhs would shout at my mum over the phone i got bullied all the time by pretty much everyone i have been in over way too many fights when i take the bus i get shouted at by everyone and i have no friends my life to me always felt like hell but i always think people have it worser than me but thats just my opinion,post-pandemic

j remember i used to be funny i used to laugh and make jokes i remember being able to hold a conversation with people i wanted to know people and give back i was shy but querky talkative and funny around people who knew me now im nothing i dont seem to laugh or smile anymore i feel numb and unsatisfied with everything i do edit wow thank you everyone for your responses i thought this post would go unanswered honestly but its so comforting and reassuring to know that im not alone we just have to find the strength from somewhere to keep going on on a side note im not sure if anyone else feels like this but i sometimes think part of the reason is i have this intense fear of losing people so much in fact that i start believing in the values and hobbies of the people in my life in the hopes theyll like me and not leave i just agree and comply with everything ive done this for so long i just dont know who i am anymore,pre-pandemic
sorry this is so long i dont mean to be annoying i just wanted to vent and it turned out longer than i meant eating ice cream for dinner with a hard cider and whiskey since i cant be bothered to cook or eat anything thought things were finally getting better ive been looking at new apartments that are cheaper so i can leave this one in september when the lease ends i was getting used to working 2 jobs got on antidepressants and someone was finally taking my adhd concerns seriously i was interviewing at a higher paying job at a company my friend works at and i was so excited and ive been so ready to leave my full time job i worked with a women who gave me rides to and from work since i live near the highway and she had to pass my building everyday to get to and from work i live 2 miles away from work last week she suddenly got laid off which was sad she was one of the few people at my job who really talked to me it also meant that i was no longer able to commute to my second job because it takes too long to get home since i walk now then on the same day as all of that i was rejected from the job i was really excited about tried to make the best of not having a second job by finally looking at driving courses to learn to drive since i have had my permit for a year and not much time to learn with two jobs i was in an abusive relationship from 1626 and i am 28 now he took all my money and barely let me have any to buy anything to eat let alone pay for driving classes i was gonna use the 1000 i managed to save up towards an apartment and try and get a car that way then i came to reality and realized how expensive the used car market still is i was also told by all driving programs within the area i could afford to get to by uber only offered adult driving lessons during the day when i am at work they are 1012 hour programs broken up into 1 hour lessons i can take some time off work but not 1012 days plus a day to take the road test i dont have a lot of friends and mainly speak to my boyfriend and like 1 other person i only really spend time with my bf on the weekends the hardest part about being at home is that my roommate decided her bf has basically moved in with us hes here almost 7 days a week for months all of his stuff is everywhere hes here even when shes not he has a key i told them that it violates our lease and we can get evicted and showed them both the paragraph from our lease we are only permitted to have overnight gets 6 times in a month and no more than 2 times in a week he only started staying over more i tried to report it but havent heard anything back from the building theyre so loud and take over the whole space its a 2 bedroom apartment and it feels crowded with 3 people and i cant really have people over half the fridge is filled with her stuff half with his and i struggle to squeeze my stuff in there id have to push his stuff around the table after 15 hour work days just to have enough space to eat they constantly wake me up because my room is next to the living room and kitchen where they spend most their time they also blast movies very loud and the living room tv shares a wall with my room trying to figure out how to bring it up again with her because she doesnt like being told no and she throws tantrums when she doesnt get her way i wish these meds worked better and i feel so hopeless and alone my bf has been friends with my roommate and roommates boyfriend for many years so he doesnt like to get involved its so isolating and i literally have no one im so close to giving up and no one has any clue in the world,post-pandemic

its my 17th birthday today and first of all none of my friends except 3 wished me at home my stupid dad was to drunk to acknowledge me and i am sitting here on my birthday in tears feeling alone edit thanks a lot for all the nice comments it is crazy how people on the interent can be so kind and it has meant a lot another edit it is the day after my birthday and i woke up to like 300 messeges holy crap thanks a lot i dont think you understand how much it has cheered me up i will make sure to reply to everyone but i dont want to rush it but from the bottom of my heartthank you,pre-pandemic
i dont know i guess when things are really bad for whatever reason i just tell myself ill be an adult one day and if by then things dont feel different i can always just jump off a balcony or buy a gun or overdose on sleeping pills its becoming a regular thought in my head and it disturbs me how comforting it feels,post-pandemic
i dont understand why its so easy to get lost in life i understand that maybe theres nothing you can do about it but its still a huge problem isnt it why dont all the people who are suffering from this and whose lives are being destroyed because of it start screaming about it so that all the hurt people will realize how many people like them exist it may sound like im a crazy founder of a revolutionary movement maybe i want to be one and maybe im just thinking too much right now however it seems extremely wrong that mental health issues are still such an issue and i know that people know about this and i know that there are a lot of people like i describe but so what i dont want to underestimate other important issues i just want this problem to be solved,post-pandemic
ive posted a few videos about this topic before people can feel free to disagree and thats fine what i dont agree with is the admins just deleting the posts because they dont like the message so im not going post any videos or links ill ask the readers to answer a few honest questions if you believe that we genuinely like in a toxic patriarchy and being a straight white male gives you more privilege over others then why are men more likely to suffer from depression and suicide than women why are white people in rich first world countries often more sad and depression than people in the developing world if toxic masculinity is such a bad influence on young men than why are kids who grow up without a father or father figure far more likely to become troubled youths drop out of school and become involved in crime at a young age if being more effeminate is considered more progressive and healthy than why are these type of men more likely to suffer from stress and anxiety and unable to handle emergency situations without having a mental breakdown for example they may en emotional breakdown if a job interview doesnt go their way so how can they honestly expect to handle a situation like a road accident if being more effeminate is an ideal trait then why are women always far more often attracted to more masculine men why was something like 50 shades of grey a worldwide best seller among women when it depicts being sexually aggressive and dominating a young woman as positive if being transgender is stunning and brave essentially a man in the literally sense shedding all masculinity and becoming a woman then why are transgender people is far more likely to commit suicide even far more so than the straight white men even after they go through their transformation why is it considered sexist if a female character in a movie or tv show isnt depicted as nothing more over the top i can do anything girl power superduper yet its always perfectly fine to portray men as bumbling idiots whether its a cocky male hero who causes trouble or the sitcom foolish betamale tv dad why is it that i know someone personally who had all of these traits he hated anything heteronormative considered himself a woke male feminist would often come across as being pretentious and make leftwing political debates when if we were just out socialising would consider all religions and older traditions as just for idiots yet fall into nihilism delve into marxist theory and claim to be on the side of the working class yet never worked in manual labour a day in his life nor bother to setup a small business or volunteer came across as being effeminateeven prided himself on it and was open about virtue signalling then complained to other guys about being awkward around women he did all of this and he took his own life can you honestly say that a lack of masculinity isnt causing more problems with men in ireland and around the world this is likely to get banned again and removed if you dont agree thats fine youre free to do so when reading this post ill just ask you to keep an open mind and at least just consider it a possibility,pre-pandemic
im 18 years old right now and since i was 12 i have had awful ocd when i was 14 i went through the wrong puberty and realized i was trans at 15 i just came out to my family at 18 and they were very kind but they said things such as you cant feel a gender trans people didnt exist 15 years ago i wanted long hair at your age too i hated puberty too it crushed me they think im just a feminine gay boy and i was ready to take hormones and now they are having me question everything one of my family members said im scared of how society will treat you and i said i dont care it wont bug me and she said it will i think these ignorant fast comments are awful and critical to someone with ocd im now obsessing over wether id be able to transition or wether im even trans because of them my family has always been so good to me and thats why i feel awful being depressed i feel because people have it worse than me that i shouldnt be suicidal my mom did apologize and she cried to me saying they should have listened to me and its a lot for her to process i continued to try to explain and she still just wrote it off as im a feminine gay boy my heart hurts this was all after the night i ran out to my friends car with a bag packed and called my mom explaining to her that i needed time away and i was temporarily moving out because no one was understanding me and i started questioning everything she cried saying please come home and my dad texted me saying dont do this to your mother i still feel fucking stuck being in my childhood room in conclusion i feel nothing due to my ocd dysphoria and depression i feel immense guilt for being depressed when theres people coming out getting fully abandoned by there families im tired im numb and i havent felt anything in so long and i dont know if i ever will again im trapped in the wrong body i have no purpose i am addicted to my phone and im a terrible human i just want to be ok but here i am a beautiful house beautiful family amazing friends a cute dog yet still i waist all my time on my phone and complain on the negatives i feel like a waist and i should not have been born i am an awful awful person and honestly i probably dont deserve happiness,post-pandemic
so i 21m have been living on my own for about 5 months now ive been an adult for 3 years now and it totally blows it sucks and i hate everything about it i hate having to pay my own bills i hate being in charge of feeding myself i hate thinking about the future i hate having to clean my apartment i hate having to think about my health i hate everything relating to employment when i dont have a job im depressed because i cant support myself and when i do have a job im depressed because i spend so much time at work that i never and i mean not once the entire time ive been working full time have time to do anything that i actually want to do because assuming i eat and sleep enough to even function on a basic level at work every second away from my job i have to spend running errands that i hate and doing chores that i hate so i can not ever do anything that i want to be doing i hate having to make the physical journey to work and i hate being there even though i love the job itself on its own theres nothing in the world that i can enjoy for 7 whole hours a day 5 whole days a week i hate all of this and the biggest problem is theres nothing i can do about it if i get extremely lucky then ill have to keep doing this for another 40 years and i dont think i have the mental or emotional strength to keep going with this but i literally cant think of any other better options i just hate being an adult i havent felt a shred of happiness for even a second since i started working and planning on moving out what should i do,post-pandemic

firstly to all the women reading this just thank god every single day he didnt make you a man in this horrible decade you have so much privilege and you dont even know it you dont have to do humiliating stupid things like this and look stupid in front of everyone like i do so after feeling depressed about seeing all my friends from high school basically stop hanging out with me because they are all in relationships in college now and their girlfriends take up all their time and attention and of course im the only awkward pathetic loser whos left out i decided that tomorrow im gonna actually ask some girls out directly and probably get rejected look stupid and get laughed at by everyone near by but i guess i have to degrade myself at this point because its the only way i have absolutely no idea how relationships form normally so this is the only way i know how to do it ive never been in a relationship before so this will be my first time doing this i basically know what response to expect its either i already have a boyfriend or fuck off creep yup women get complimented by poor bastards like me and their egos are so inflated they can respond like that but doing something like this is unimaginably difficult for someone like me with anxiety problems and low self esteem it really is i have to fight with myself just to spit out a few words with anyone that is very hard for me to do without stuttering and shaking but thats reality for most men these days goddamit i wish i was born a girl i would have everything in life handed to me if i wanted a boyfriend i would get one simply by existing i hate my life i really do but as a man i have to suffer struggle and fight to the death just for the smallest bit of happiness in life because thats my fate as a man ive been cursed by god to be born as a man in 2017 i must have done something horrible in a previous life to be made like this im convinced of that and honestly if i get rejected enough times and laughed at enough times tomorrow im just gonna drive into a fucking tree i just cant live with myself anymore hopefully ill be reborn a female and finally live an easy life,pre-pandemic

i have very little energy for the day by default but i found that talking with someone quickly drains me and depletes whatever energy i do have after just a little while i feel like i can barely talk anymore i feel literally like im losing air and then i basically have to force myself to speak oh well,post-pandemic
its as if god himself is playing a cruel joke on his own creation if i ever meet god im going to try to kill him with my bare hands my life is meaningless there is no joy to be had knowing that i am too stupid to make it in the real world thats just the way it is im not allowed to have a brain that actually functions like its supposed to this just pisses me off it increases my bitter hatred towards the rest of humanity i refuse to participate anyone who would shame me for it is an asshole and id wish them a painful death,pre-pandemic

i know that reddit tends to look askance at faith but i do find comfort in the words of prayer when i am struggling as i am now before i go to bed tonight i will close my eyes and say prayer for the collective sorrow and pain of everyone here tonight and for all those over at rsuicidewatch if you would like i can send you the words i use they are words of comfort and hope and though they mention god you need not believe in anything but your own compassion to use them i dont always find comfort in them but sometimes they are all i have edit i hope that this doesnt make anyone uncomfortable i am by no means trying to advocate religion as the answer to your problems this is merely my way of saying that i am thinking of you and extending my compassion towards your suffering,pre-pandemic
ive been feeling really depressed and lonely lately from my job im a full time late night janitor for a courthouse just 10 miles away from my hometown working there has been pretty easy but i wound up feeling super lonely a lot considering i dont really get to talk to my friends or hang out with them much so just today i came home late as usual and i have a little interaction with my mom after she made a joke to me that i took pretty personal and felts like was more of an insult rather than a sense of humor i told her that i didnt really want to joke around like that but she refused to listen and told me to just go away then despite attempting to change the topic and explain why i havent been feeling so high all she kept doing was telling what a great mom she is for raising me and my brother while struggling to make ends meet and keep the house what an ungrateful little bastard i am for not appreciating her hard work and sacrifices at that moment i was legitimately about to begin to cry but rather instead of pausing and trying to reverse the damages all my mom did was host a little parental style of the oppression olympics and proclaim her amount of tears and cries over the course of three weeks i got out just before my first tear would legitimately run down my cheek and even before i went to bed she goes on about how her life is more worse than ours then escalates into a more this is why youd make a terrible mistake getting behind the wheel considering i had practice driving this morning unaware that she had just lite the fuse to trigger the firework but she didnt seem to care thanks for reading i hope you feel better soon and find the key to unlocking your next set of happiness along with having a parent who doesnt make your suffering all about them and why you shouldnt be depressed,pre-pandemic

hello i will start by saying that ive never had to deal with any profound hardship in my young life im only 19 but i am depressed to the point that it is absolutely eating away my drive and motivation i have an extremely high iq 160 and while many people see this as being a gift it has been nothing but a tremendous curse schoolwork has come easily to me but i cant maintain friendships or relationships dont get me wrong im not your stereotypical gamernerdgeek but rather quite the opposite i was a 3 sport athlete my whole life i am in phenomenal shape i have been told i am very good looking not by my mom or grandmother even and i actually have very good interpersonal skills and consider myself to be a little bit of an extrovert the issue in my life has been that i am too smart please dont think that i am full of myself because im not ive tried to blind myself to my own intelligence my whole life and its finally coming to haunt me i am completely unable to connect with people who arent as smart as me i overthink everything and its impossible not to the problem is that i dont have anyone to talk about my deeper thoughts with and i cant find any i go to a highly selective college and even still i am levels above every person ive met the only way ive been able to cope with this is by drinking my intelligence away i cannot begin to describe how blissful it is to feel alcohol working in my system and numbing my mind it is only then when i am capable of shutting my brain up and having a conversation with somebody while being on their level this is the first time ive ever talked about this problem ive never brought it up to anybody because i dont think they would understand and take what i was saying the wrong way i dont believe im better than anybody else but i am a lot smarter im hoping there is somebody here who suffers from the same thing i just want to see that im not alone here,pre-pandemic
for context im an almost 16 year old trans guy this is somewhat relevant awhile ago i was at a church camp over the weekend and i had planned to kill myself because i couldnt handle my feelings anymore but something happened and i confessed to my friends and then before we went home i gave the pills and razor i was going to use to another girl in trust i couldnt handle keeping them to myself at that moment but she snitched and told the leaders who then called my parents and had to legally made a report to cps i managed to tell my parents that the stuff werent mine but a few days ago they started asking about it again when i wasnt ready for it i didnt know what to say and accidentally slipped up and i think they know ive been lying before that they had also misinterpreted my words and thought i meant it was my best friend who had brought the pills and razor on wednesday im having a meeting with social services about it and on friday im being forced to go to therapy i dont know what i should do should i keep lying or tell them the truth please help me,post-pandemic

if i dont wanna keep going why should i i had no choice in my birth and i dont have a choice really in my death either i mean i could off myself but no one would really respect my choice i dont know i dont get much joy out of life i never really had much of a chance to i get some but i dont know if its worth going on and on forever i hate all of the obligations there are to stay alive i stay alive mostly for other people i know thats important i wish i could be selfish and die i used to think growing up that once my parents both died id just kill myself too i feel like that might still be a good plan for me i have goals and desires as well as things i want to do but i also dont really enjoy life this is all selfish im aware perhaps its wrong of me to think this way but i feel resentment towards my existence resentment towards the obligations and feelings i hold towards others resentment of my love for them and their love for me i daydream about becoming a major asshole to everyone just so i can off myself and have people celebrate my death but i also cant bring myself to be a jerk,post-pandemic

i want to start off by saying that there is so much evidence showing that stress effects health negatively and in pretty extreme ways too i want to cope with stress and theres all sorts of methods but its mostly stuff like go on a walk how do you cope with stress when the things youve gone through and are going through are extreme things like abuse illness homelessness etc ive been through all of the above and im tired of hearing that i can manage stress when these things are genuinely not manageable you can minimize it but theres no minimizing something that is an every day constant reality ive been chronically stressed through childhood and im worried about the ramifications its going to have on my health i genuinely want advice if anyone has any,post-pandemic
24 years old no love life whatsoever kissless virgin socially inept insecure suicidal on and off but i was working hard on myself and felt i had made tremendous improvements over the past few months and believed i was on the road to recovery by myself thought i was finally in a good spot met this girl off tinder well call her jenny for privacy sake have been on plenty of tinder dates in the past so wasnt expecting much i have never clicked with a girl like i did this one down to earth funny unique flirty cute checked boxes i didnt even know i had i struggled the entire date with being awkward and nervous and she was still so cool about it towards the end when i was sure she was going to leave and ghost me she said she was still waiting for a kiss i was on cloud 9 after the date then the insecurities and mental illness i thought i was working past returned in overdrive over the next few days i made stuff up lied trying to figure some stuff out for insecurities gas lit her was an absolute horrible human being lied some more and chased her away assumed she was talking to other dudes which even if she was it would have been none of my business thought the energy between us changed after the date even though texting habits never changed and we were still talking got immediately unhealthily attached and ruined everything caused by my own insecure insanity and actions all of that work i thought i did to help myself was a ruse this gave me the rude awakening that i was never okay and that i needed help i was in the best mental spot id been at in years and a single date with a one of a kind girl that i single handedly ruined afterwards due to my own undiscovered traumas was enough to bring me from the top of the mountain i recently climbed back down to near suicide at the drop of a dime it gave me the insight and fortitude to reach out to ones i thought no longer loved me for help and with their support and professional help i am doing what i once thought was impossible and could never do it is getting better the feeling this girl gave me regardless of how my mental illnesses ruined it afterwards inspired me that there is hope there are things worth living for but you just might not be in the right state to find them it is extremely pathetic to let something so small such a short relationship with someone i barely knew impact me so heavily but i will use this experience to learn from my mistakes and make my life worth living thank you jenny,post-pandemic
people tend to notice that i look sadpissed off most of the time they say things like cheer up and i respond with something like fuck that shit it sort of makes me feel like a stoic hardass because ive gotten so used to feeling like this i see happiness as a weakness maybe its because im a bit of a masochist,pre-pandemic
even if its societally wrong i felt such a sense of pride in being able to regurgitate an entire kfc meal 5min after finishing it that i had to take a photo it made me smile for the first time in two days feeling my empty stomach and staring at the mess in the toilet bowl i felt a sense of power and control i hadnt felt in years washing over me and a little voice whispering dont stop youre on the right path you can do this i cant control my epilepsy i cant control my endometriosis i cant control the constant blow ups in my sorry excuse for a relationship that have left me feeling suicidal i cant control how low my self esteem and self worth have dropped i cant control that nobody in my real life cares about me i tried to kill myself yesterday my partner left me with a family member who doesnt give a shit about me and didnt check on me even once because i was too much for his mental health but i can control this i finally have something that i have complete power and control over my weight and im going to be the fucking boss of it even if it kills me from now on im only keeping down weetbix with skim milk bananas green beans and sugarfree drinks everything else will be purged within 5min of being consumed because im a disgusting fatty who needs to lose weight so i can actually look at myself in the mirror when getting dressed without wanting to vomit on an empty stomach,post-pandemic
me and my sisters have depression possibly bipolar and get worse before our periods i usually feel easily irritable and triggered easier crying more and suicidal thoughts by like 10 it could just be pms i dont think its pmdd because my sister has it and i dont think im as bad as her its gotten worse since my mania psychosis episode same with my depression another thing i get is i cant focus on too much example my sister was just dancing around in the living room like she normally does while i was watching tv she wasnt even making noise or anything i couldnt focus on my tv show and got annoyed but i knew it was stupid to be annoyed and that she did nothing wrong tw i also felt like pinching myself and started scratching hardermore i was already scratching because i was itchy this couldve been because what i was watching had some emotional mental health related scenes sorry for the long post lol can anyone relate,post-pandemic

this girl recently took a liking to me and started texting me over whatsapp up until now i dont know if she likes me or if she is just stringing me along for her own self esteme i have been nothing but nice to this girl asking her how her day was sending her morning text messages of encouragement listening to her petty problems but i just cant seem to let go of her some part of me believes that her and her roommate are just toying with my emotions and another part thinks that she might like me i cant emphasize might enough i never asked her why she started talking to me because i figured it might scare her off cause i would come off as being unfriendly but now i feel horrible because i let her into my life and she can probably get with another guy and forget all about me i barely have any friends and talking to her kinda helped me feel a little better about myself but now i feel like i will never live up to her expectation of what she might want in a guy i feel like she is testing the waters but i dont recall ever not being sweat and encouraging why do girls do this if you like a guy fucking say it stop dragging us along and playing with our emotions,pre-pandemic

bunch of people hating on the op for bitchy little mistakes she made in high school how are people expected to ever love themselves and forgive themselves if other people claim there can be no forgiveness if others claim they should never be loved how can we as a community claim to be anything but contributors to problems like depression and suicide if we literally claim forgiveness is not possible if we explicitly tell those with regrets that they should let them haunt themselves forever and can never be forgiven this site makes me fucking sick,pre-pandemic

i have no desire to get up earlier and do something with my day even though if i could force myself id probably feel better it starts to get dark within an hour of waking up usually and its so depressing but it keeps me isolated in my comfort zone being up in the middle of the night feels freeing for some reason no one awake no guilt for responsibilities i can sleep away the day and not feel guilty about it but im wasting time and i want more than anything to feel okay again i want to start to get my life back to something that i can derive some genuine enjoyment out of and move forward with productive things i became depressed again about 10 months ago since my mom passed and these past 10 months have gone by so fast im almost 26 and im scared at how fast time is moving without any stability forming in my life tldr im 25 and i feel like im wasting time which i am but its so hard to even attempt to start getting my life in order it feels so far out of reach,post-pandemic
i dont even know why im writing this after reading some of the posts here i feel like most of you have it much worse and you still manage better than i do for some backstory i was never the type to have a lotta friends and only had my one bff for 12 years in 2021 i went to canada for an exchange year and had an absolute blast not just a fun trip but i had genuine connections and for the first time i felt like people beside my bff or my family cared about my existence when i came back after a year and had to leave all of that i was naturally devestated and was searching for support from my friend he however had found himself a gf and compleatly left me we live 20 mins from eachother and in the 2 weeks before he would move away he told me he simply didnt have time for me i told him how much that hurt and that after 12 years of very close friendship i expected differently and he simply told me that it wasnt his fault because he had stuff to do i later through some other people found out he did infact not have stuff to do and even his gf went home to where he was moving i asume so he was alone the last 3 days this broke me i have since build a sort of social wall around myself that inhibits me from enjoying the company of people and my social battery is so drained that even talking to my parents is getting exhausting quickly these days i feel like a shell of my former self i used to play tennis i quit i used to enjoy videogames anything no matter how good gets boring as soon as i start it i usually dont make it past the loading screen i have tried getting in better shape by working out and eating more so i transformed our basement into a gym but it is extreamly hard to commit du to my constant thinking that its all useless anyways i am at 195 cm and weigh 72kg even though i have thought about ending it more and longer than i am willing to accept i havent actually hurt myself in a meaningfull way and most likely wont ever due to my family being around and i dont want to cause stress for them in the end i dont feel like i am justified in my suffering cuz i never had any struggles with money have loving parents and a brother that i love more than anything else even though he moved away to stay with his gf i read about the storys of others and hear of abuse trauma or other stuff like that and just think wow how much of a pussy am i to cry about my few issues english isnt my first language so do hate on me for buchering some words when i wake up tmrw i will most likely delete this,post-pandemic

at least thats what i tell myself when i start feeling shitty for having no friends having no future plans and really not having a life much at all im constantly waiting for the next month to start as if i think a new month will bring any change to my dull life i just hope one day things will change this isnt the life i imagined for themself so i just hope and pray that things will turn around sorry this is a random post just had to say it to someone,pre-pandemic
a bad week bad month bad year bad 5 years i stay physically active i try to engage as much as i can socially i try new things all the time i have a good sleep schedule my job is good and i stay away from drugs and alcohol i feel like im doing everything right but i feel so worthless my hobbies are excruciatingly effortfilled and nonfulfilling as a selfloathing narcissist i feel i am doing everything any decent therapist would advise i have always tried to be the friend for my friends who are going through shit and ive been successful for the most part my mindset of it being a phase has not changed my habits reflect that of a healthy person i donate to charity i made this post on a throwaway account not to jerk myself off for being a good person but for the sole very selfish reason that everything i have tried everything i have told others to try has failed to make me happy in any sense of the word i see people so less fortunate than me with no food security and no roof over their heads in what world do we exist together and i get to be the one bitching about my problems when they dont death seems compelling because its new and its taboo i dont see offing myself before trying to travel the world but at 19 years old a middleclass white guy in the us with privilege some would probably kill to have its on my mind constantly i cant stand the monotony of being a human of being alive i couldnt stand to talk to someone about this in real life itd feel like attentionseeking considering my privilege anywho i dont expect or see any answers and i hope nobody wastes too much time on this post at the very least i hope this post can make someone else feel slightly less alone needed to get it off my chest and were all in this together i suppose thanks to anyone for reading my word vomit,post-pandemic
last therapy session i was explaining to my psychologist about my inner child an expression which i hate but it made sense at the time i described how it felt like she was trapped in a stone room with one high window which she can look out and hear other kids playing outside she wants to leave the room but she knows its safe in there and that makes her frightened to leave i drew this afterwards i cant draw but i hope someone else can relate to it edit damn this got traction thank you for the award and the upvotes im glad that this doodle has touched so many people bless yall,post-pandemic

is it just me im just so sick of being alone especially as a male and all i just want to cut the bullshit and the dating mind games and find someone especially a woman who knows what i might be going through like someone on this subreddit im sick of being alone im tired of the bullshit and im tired of having to look forward to the next 70 years of being all alone because i had the misfortune of being born with shitty genetics and being short and unattractive why dont there seem to be anyone else out there who feels like i do who just wants to cut the bullshit and the posturing and peacocking and just willing to admit im lonely youre lonely we have these many other things in common lets hook up and be friendslovers its like so many others out there and on this sub would rather be lonely and depressed than cut the bs of dating and all that showboating shit i cant be the only one who is lonely and fed up right or maybe i really am the only fucking depressed guy on this entire sub who is so pathetic he cant even get a girlfriend unlike everyone else apparently i wont lie when i say it really pisses me off to see other people on here with partners that came from a loving family and have an otherwise great life who still feel like shit i feel like they dont even deserve to feel depressed they have everything yet some people probably most on this sub are like that they have loving supportive partners they get sex they have parents who love them they have wellpaying careers yet still feel hopeless i know people cant control how they feel but it still pisses me off because their problems seem trivial and nonexistent compared to mine im always like at least you have someone i dont have any of that shit i just want to cut the crap and be with a decent girl thats not too much to ask for is it apparently it is because literally everyone else diagnosed as depressed and on this sub seem to has a loving partner and friends and family and a steady income and i dont have shit its not like im an asshole or abusive or a cheater or anything am i i cant help but feel im being punished for something in a past life when even i cant get the most basic thing everyone else on here even has i guess i must be an asshole if thats the case its the only thing that makes sense even the most morose people on here still get to fuck and have someone hold them close at night edit just wanted to point out im a little lonely but i dont blame this on anyone its just my own shit to deal with it just annoys me when even awful people out there in the world end up being with someone and having otherwise blessed lives including murderers and rapists,pre-pandemic

venting out i 28f come from a nuclear family and my dad had been on work trips for most parts so i was raised majorly by my mom and i have no siblings my dad was one of the best people on earth and i lost him a few months ago my mom on the other hand is a good person but she was extremely verbally abusive towards everyone in the family and physically abusive to us and her parents so i always hated her growing up i saw my dad getting abused by her my whole life and never knew what i could do to help him so i ended up crying all the time but both of them loved me to death we have moved a lot geographically so i was never able to have stable group of friends finally i went to an all girls college and everyone hated me there as i was this extremely spoiled daddys princess who knew nothing in real world and i used to cry in my room all the time so my life was still pretty fucked up the only escape i ever had was jumping from one relationship to another i have been doing that since i was 14 so i continued doing that i threw all my anger at my boyfriends and then would change my relationship when things would get bad anyhow my college got over and i got a job and have been working since this is the only good thing i have i am financially independent i got into this relationship over 2 years ago and things were wonderful in the beginning except i messed things up by throwing my anger at him but he never left me and i thought hey now that all my anger is gone i can finally begin to be a healthy relationship but god had other plans he has started to take revenge and he insults me hurts me blames every chance he gets and i have lost every ounce of self respect i ever had he is a good guy and had made significant sacrifices to be with me does not have bad habits nothing questionable so i feel that if i let him go i wouldnt ever get a good guy so i digest all the hatred with a pinch of salt i do this because i think its my karma coming back and this is what i deserve i have lost my dad a few months ago then i had a surgery which has an extremely long recovery and one of my closest friends got married and rest of them are all married engaged pregnantmaking alot of money i am living with my family due to recovery and they love me but i think they dont like me as a person and that is true for everyone else in my life too i do not have friends to reach out to therapy is too expensive my boyfriend hates me cant share all this with my family as my mom is also processing grief overall i am completely alone and super lonely another thing to know about me is i am an extremely logical person thrive for perfection in every aspect of my life and generally dont give importance to emotions and now i am overwhelmed to point where i dont know what to do i know for a fact that this relationship is doomed to fail and i am not cut out to be a wifemother i lack empathy and emotional understanding plus i have too much baggage i had hobbies when i was a child but since we moved so much geographically i got out of touch and now i have no hobby my mom also made sure to feed me for my entire life that my friends are bad my relatives are bad everyone is out there to hurt me so as an adult i never know how to sustain any friendship and i also have no contact with my relatives because i wasnt allowed to for about 25 years i am a complete loner and all i want is to stay on my bed and use my phone which is really depressing but thats what i like however i do make a effort to do a few things during the day as a result of all of the above i feel like i am going to die alone,post-pandemic

just a thought that sprung up out of nowhere yesterday im not even sure whether i really believe it or not but it does come from a real place for a long time ive been worrying that the only reason i still consider myself a christian is because atheism is antithetical to my precious selfimage but now im wondering if it was just a subconscious survival mechanism all this time i cant kill myself because its a sin and ill go to hell but if it werent a sin if i had no eternal fate to consider what reason would i have not to give in to the cold embrace of death granted my suicidal ideation hasnt yet progressed beyond the point of dude i wonder if i could just like starve myself or something and ive never considered it an immediate tangible threat but if at some point in the future i reach such a low point that i decide to give up on religion entirely what would be there to stop me,pre-pandemic

i had suicidal thoughts ever sinced i was 12 whenever my parents scold me for my mistakes or for doing something wrong i felt horrible one day i drink an air wick which only made my throat and stomach hurt a few days after that i havent done anything except punching myself out of frustration but thats only occasionally now that im 18 sometimes i hold a knife it makes me think about ending myself but i tell myself that things will get better but after saying that to myself i know that wont happen im good at my engineering class i would say top 3 but as soon as i walk out my smile vanish i dont even know if it was my own choice to be there maybe i just did it to impress my parents i got to admit that i enjoyed it but im not sure if it will be a good job for the rest of my life i feel like im good but that i could be better and that no matter what i do im always behind i would love to be a leader of a team but im not confident enough to take charge as i feel i can mess up im good at speaking english but whenever someone points out my mistakes it makes me feel disappointed on myself after i learn how to drive i thought it would be fun to drive wherever i want but now that i do drive on my own i feel more lonely i would like to talk to a girl at my class about hanging out but seeing her talk to other boys makes me feel jealous but i hate feeling that way and i then i ignore her for a while i dont know why i do it i feel like one day i would snap out but i would most likely hurt myself before hurting others im afraid that day will come after that messy essay i want to know if anyone can give an advice or something to help me out,post-pandemic

i think i run behind things that i know would cause me pain to justify this chronic depressed feeling which doesnt seem to go away really i am addicted to tv shows that shows such complex characters who are alone and sad in their alone true self but sunshine for the outer world its not like i am not happy it comes in waves but id kill to feel normal again sometime and not this gloomy almost all the time when i dont have to pretend otherwise in front of a company am i really depressed or is it how it is for all of us,post-pandemic

ive been dealing with depression for a number of years now i find masturbation as a temporary relief of that feeling does anyone else feel this way,pre-pandemic
no im in no danger of offing myself so no need to send out the cavalry but i am so tired of having to remember what it feels like feel good instead of actually feeling good im tired of having to remind myself that how i feel is not normal im tired of having to remind myself my feelings are separate from me im tired of having to distract myself from my feelings to get through today every fucking day im tired of feeling like crying everyday all day everyday im tired of having to have some mild stimulant just to feel whole pardon the pun but my depression is fucking depressing,pre-pandemic
honestly dont know how to cope with this i workout everyday just to keep the negative thinking away but its always coming back i mean i deserve it since im a fuckup and nobody wants to hire me even for food deliveries im also too old apparently 31 and achieved nothing in my life and everytime i feel a little hope it just goes down the drain and i get stuck in the same shit as before everything just feels unbearable and i really wish i had the balls to put myself down try to watch youtube but its full of drama comedians and usually people that feel the need to make a penis inspection contest for what they have or what they achieved in life eagerly to judge and stomp on people like me and feeling righteous while doing it so i try to listen to music but i feel out of time at this point and it makes me feel nostalgic in a bad way used to go to a lot of local hardcoremetalcorealternative show when i was younger so i look on google for results for similar things that im feeling and reading some of the comments just makes me think wow my brain is kinda right i should just end my life the only funny thing about youtube is the suicide prevention stuff where there is always a little quote it gets better with the same sad corporate music mostly aimed at young adult or teens so i guess the nice cute message is not for me,post-pandemic
a few weeks ago i intentionally took an overdose of tylenol about 20 or so 500mg pills i went to the hospital afterwards in a panic and yesterday the bill came in the mail for 1800 i feel extremely guilty now because i am not employed and my parent pays my medical bills i had to hand them the letter last night and when i did i began crying and i ran back into my bedroom i had no idea it would be so expensive and if i had i surely wouldnt have taken the overdose in the first place and this guilt is made even worse by the fact that i hadnt even taken enough of the tylenol to do any harm i didnt need to have my stomach pumped or anything like that i just genuinely didnt know at the time whether or not the amount i took would have caused harm so i panicked and i went to the hospital now im wishing i hadnt gone and i feel so stupid because the decision to overdose was impulsive and i wasnt even trying to kill myself i was just not thinking about any type of consequence at all and i wanted to hurt myself if i was doing it with the intent of killing myself i wouldve taken a lot more because i do have access to a lot more than i actually took so the entire situation and the bill just feels like such a waste i feel so guilty and ashamed and i havent faced my parent since running away crying last night im afraid for when ill have to,post-pandemic
but here i am 24 years old man and doing exactly that,pre-pandemic

venting is one thing but when someone says overly negative things about themselves and another says me too it reinforces those beliefs then someone looking at these comments might think that its ok to engage in that thinking too it turns into a virus almost im not saying that its wrong i understand the negative things that flow through your head when depressed but i think its important that people dont accept them as the truth depression is bad enough reinforcing negative ideas about ourselves will only make it worse theres a point where it becomes less about venting and turns into too much negativity i may come across as insensitive in this post but ive realized through my struggles with depression you have some control over your thoughts if you let them get out of control they can take you to a dark place,pre-pandemic
i took three bottles of various pills in my cupboard downed a fifth of tequila and put a pipe to my cars exhaust into the drivers side window and cried tears of joy that it was finally going to be over i passed out and woke up in the ambulance strapped to a gurney confused sobbing and hysterical my housemate got home early and found me i was admitted into the icu spent my birthday christmas new years etc in the psych ward for three months going through ect all i can think of lately is not messing up this time it hurts because im a perfectionist and i couldnt get it right,pre-pandemic

i dont know im just so sad i kinda want just to vent because i feel like nobody is listening the way i need them to also i always get the feeling that im not allowed to be sad i always have to get happy again soon because i make others uncomfortable they tell me to get professional help which i try to but its hard here so i just try to eat it up and smile because anyways im always sad so it doesnt matter i dont want to be annoying too needy and insecure i get left i cant even vocalize what i need maybe just someone who listens silently to my pain while holding me in the arms even if its the 50th time they repeatedly hear the same story the same hurt which suddenly got triggered and just needs to be out of my system so i have space for the stuff i need to learn in my apprenticeship since years im so numb psychologically and physically sometimes i wish my old me back where i was self destructive it actually helped me but now with a few years therapy i cant enjoy as lack of better term it as i used to it doesnt help me i really want to feel the pain but im not allowed to everybodys saying im there for you but in the end its always the same have you tried xy to get better but it wont stop the ache inside my heart idk,post-pandemic

lately im gaming 610 hours out of the day just to distract myself from feeling empty i guess its better than wallowing in my depression but the minute i stop im back to suicide ideation i get it cant fix my problems but the anxiety of stopping and letting myself feel is too much its getting bad again really bad and i cant really talk to anybody in my life about it im not eating im not sleeping im just exisiting at this point and not really living i just think if i pull myself away from the screen ill give into the temptations that keep haunting me edit wow i honestly didnt expect this to blow up thank you everyone for your kindness i appreciate it so much the amount of support through your comments and messages is incredible thank you so much i shouldve mentioned i do have a job its a casual job but it pays the bills and i also do have a therapist who is also great but i at times feel like i shelter him from a lot of whats been going on i have friends and family i could talk to but with my history of mental health it would just burden them more than it already has i will try reply to everyones comments and messages,post-pandemic

i used to think that a better world was possible that fellow humans could work together for the good of others the uss response to coronavirus has reminded me of how stupid i was the vast majority of people only care about themselves when the government asks them to stay home they go to the gym or rock climbing or to a concert they continue having large gatherings some of them cant even be bothered to wear a mask without complaining about tyranny one of my siblings is flying home for thanksgiving and i know that he definitely doesnt care about the virus anymore the few of us that really care about stopping the spread of the pandemic have all our efforts shat upon by everyone elses carelessness this toxic individualism is going to be the death of so many people and no one fucking cares how can my country fight climate change end poverty and give people healthcare if no one gives a shit about anyone but themselves i just want to light this whole country on fire and watch it burn for all of its crimes against humanity but that would require motivation and my depression is making it hard to do anything,post-pandemic
being raped and being on lexapro ruined my genitalia and its ruining my state of mind please help hey yall not sure how to start this so i think ill just get into it at 1213 years old i f19 started feeling deep depression due to extreme bullying at school i started therapy and then lexapro at 17 my anxiety decreased but i now also had an extremely low sex drive plus genital numbness i decided that was better than daily panic attacks and constant depression so i took the pill regularly and properly when i was 18 i was unfortunately raped several times by my longterm boyfriend who i considered to be the love of my life what was left of a sex drive was now destroyed now matched with even deeper depression and incredibly incredibly low self worth regarding my body and my sex life not long after that i was diagnosed with spastic pelvic walls or an extreme form of vaginismus ive always been incredibly tight for a lack of better words not able to fit a tampon usually passing out from extreme panic and pain when i tried im not able to have proper sex because of it the only time ive been penetrated was by my ex when he would rape me and that was the worst pain of my life physically and emotionally im now 19 and im in a happy committed relationship i love him deeply and hes a great partner however i find myself so depressed that i cant provide for him sexually not only for his sake but for mine my entire genital region is broken and it makes me feel like less of a woman for it i understand that a working vagina or any vagina for that matter is not what makes a woman but its the only way i can describe it since theres no proper term for female emasculation ive started wellbutrin and stopped lexapro around two weeks ago and im very anxious to not see any improvement i also start pelvic floor therapy next month to help with my pelvis spasms i understand that it can take up to three months but im looking for reassurance from others in the same boat i cant keep doing this anymore i hate myself and body and suicide is constantly on my mind if anyone has dealt with this or something similar id love to hear your advice thank you please do not tell me that sex isnt that important ive had several people tell me its okay to not have it in our lives but this is way deeper than that this is now a physical issue,post-pandemic

aka survivorship bias we hear the stories of the people whose mental illness got better but theres little acknowledgement of those who have only gone downhill im tired of hearing it will get better just look at what happened to me because it hasnt why should i continue suffering for the lofty hope that my depression will ease up i call it as i see it if my mental state has deteriorated even after years of treatment then i probably wont end up as a survivor,pre-pandemic
i dont have any friends who want to spend time with me i have on friend but she doesnt care and i know that she doesnt im not in a relationship and never have been and probably never will be my entire life has been watching other people make friends get into relationships and be happy i know i will be alone until i die i havent hung out with someone in months maybe even a year i try to ask if people wanna spend time with me and go somewhere but they either say no or flake on me i feel like the least important person in this entire world i cant even maintain a friendship so hoping for a relationship is unrealistic im so sad and so tired of crying about this every single night,pre-pandemic

fuck this fuck chemical imbalance fuck people who say this bullshit fuck people who use chemical imbalance as yet another way to tell me i am literally too stupid to know myself or my situation fuck you if youre one of them fuck people who refuse to accept that sometimes life just sucks and feeling shitty about it is a perfectly rational response sometimes its not the temporary problem you say it is sometimes the closest it gets to temporary is the fact that im not fucking immortal so that when i finally mercifully die my problems will finally mercifully be over depression is not always some bullshit chemical imbalance sometimes lufe is shit sometimes believe it or not the depressed person youre talking to isnt some huge idiot who just needed done brave soultm like you to tell them that theyre too fucking stupid to think right like when you tell then their life objectively isnt as shitty as they know it is its just their poor dumb brain fuck off,pre-pandemic
the first advice you see on googling depression is do things you used to enjoy right well ive gotten really good at making myself do things i make myself do my job i make myself do a side hustle i make myself read books and post about them on my blog this month im making myself do nanowrimo i presume the idea is that at some point you start enjoying things again but i havent ever managed to get to that stage i dread my side hustle i never know what to say about books until i start writing i write exactly the number of words i need to hit my goal and then i stop i dont enjoy any of it some of it i really hate and ive been doing the side hustle for a year and five months and the blog for two years so its not a matter of it give it time x200b i dont know how to make myself do things if i dont treat them as obligations anything optional i just dont do it feels like a vicious cycle where the only way to make myself do something also makes me hate it is there a way around this has anyone else felt this i cant seem to find anything online that even mentions this being a problem let alone actually proposing a solution x200b im trying to make myself go for a walk every day because thats supposed to be good for your mood and it feels like an actual punishment,post-pandemic
the fact that im still here weirds me out considering i have no real purpose or human connections,post-pandemic
as someone who has dealt with intense depression that runs in the family for years i have to say most of the posts here are just people claiming they have it the worst with no real plan to get better most people here seem to love wallowing in each others depression not doing a damn thing about it when someone gives advice such as start keeping a journal go on a walk before bed try and find something you enjoy and spend time getting better at it the only response they get is wow thanks you cured my depression s or something to the tune of dude you dont know me my depression is much worse than anybody elses guys it gets fucking draining perhaps the reason you are depressed is because youre so god damn lazy,pre-pandemic
i hate waking up to my alarm every morning i just wish i existed in a never ending dream,post-pandemic
i hate to blame others for my depression but last year i cut out a long term friend who was a bad influence on me from my life and ive been doing much better at first i didnt associate feeling better with that event but recently ive limited contact with my sibling whos personality is similar to the fore mentioned friend and ive got to tell you its like a weight has been lifted off of my shoulders ive had more energy i want to focus on work more i have goals lined up my emotions seem much more in check i almost wonder if i should just ditch the rest of my friends and start over with more ambitious people i may meet along the way i could just be in the honey moon phase of feeling free and uplifted but at least i can say that i feel pretty damn good there are so many things i can do now,pre-pandemic
hi there i want to start off by saying i dont ever use reddit so hopefully i do things right this might also come off as pretty incoherent because im basically just writing all my thoughts down a little background of me im m18 having a very hard time in college not with my grades but with my mental health ive always been pretty popular and im an extrovert but ever since getting here ive had a hard time making friends i luckily have my best friend from high school here with me but she recently got into a relationship and now i feel like i have nothing my friends from high school besides one were never really great friends and i never really found myself connecting with them well i go to the gym and think im pretty decent looking just trying to give background for the relationship part of this post i think im pretty picky about who i want to get into a relationship with too i know many college students have the same issue but i feel so alone recently ive found myself thinking some really bad things im sure you all understand what i mean the only thing i can think about is how alone i am and how much i want to be in a relationship i havent had a relationship since middle school and in high school i came out as gay not to my parents tho they still dont know i feel like i have no one to talk to anymore as like i said previously my one friend here is in a relationship and everyone else from high school are also in relationships plus at different colleges i feel like i cant tell my parents sister that the main reason im struggling to go on is because i want a bf ive made two good friends since being here but neither of them nor anyone in my classes that ive talked to have been someone i wanna try to get into a relationship with i have seen one person that i cant stop thinking about and ive never even talked to them once i told myself im just gonna ask for their number and not care about the consequences this is the only way ive ever really asked someone out because i rarely like the people that im close to but im scared that when they inevitably reject me i wont be able to handle it so ive been thinking about ways to naturally talk to them and i cant figure it out im also so scared that i will never a relationship and ill mess something up since ive been alone almost my whole life now although my main issue is loneliness i also have a real hard time finding a reason to do my work i feel like my life has all been a waste as ive never experienced really anything that a kid should i feel like there is no point in becoming an adult when ive never been a kid im so jealous of people who have had fun at parties and had relationships and got to do everything that a kid should my family has mentioned taking a break from college but i feel like since i worked so hard and am going to the best college in my state i cant waste my hard work by giving up is my thought process a recent thought that has come up to me is that when i go home for summer and do nothing but work the whole summer because my friends are all occupied with their own life am i going to be able to survive that ill have no opportunity to talk to anyone my age with no school im so scared that i wont be able to continue with that even though i have so many things to look forward to i know i should really do therapy or something but i feel like itd be dumb if i just talk about how badly i want to be in a relationship and i feel like it takes so much effort to set up im hoping anyone who hasis going through something similar has something for me and im sorry if this post is rambly or posted in the wrong sub,post-pandemic

it was all the stuff that i hadnt moved into the house yet because i didnt need it for anything at the time it was my wii my gamecube and all my old gaming stuff chargers and such my old ds stuff that i wasnt playing the thing is i left the door unlocked because theres something wrong with my car in that if i lock the door the alarm starts blaring at random like someone tried to break in i cant leave it locked and go inside for more than a few minutes before the alarm starts going off and i dont have the money right now to get it fixed so what was i suppose to do but those are excuses i shouldnt have left any valuables in there to begin with i should have taken everything inside i knew better i knew my dads care got broken into in the same driveway a few years ago but i just didnt care enough i guess and i dont think ill ever care enough i always know better but it doesnt stop me from doing stupid shit and things like this are going to keep happening to me forever because im too lazy to just do what i know needs to be done fuck me and everything i do you cant convince me this is going to get better because no matter how good it gets ill find a way to screw it up edit thanks for the downvote kind stranger i really appreciate it,pre-pandemic
ill start by saying this under no circumstances have my friends ever treated me poorly its been a while since that happened the bell rang and the break began so i went to find them and when i did they were laughing so hard i was in my very lows that day i felt so nice for them and at the same time i thought i cant offer them that before we went back to the classes i let them walk infront of me because i didnt feel like being 100 in the mood and just by looking at them i kept thinking how great they are together now today i saw some insta stories of them staying at the house of the one i am closest to and it kinda hit me again i hope i am not just jealous its just that at points i feel like i annoy them when they give me no reason to believe that i always tell jokes and laugh and 90 of the time they wont even notice the state of me because of how well i hide it i love them yet i am sure they deserve someone who is not like me especially the one i am or used to yes i am insecure be closest to she deserves the world and shes always been there for me but i cant keep being a burden to someone so kind whom i love so much i just feel like they clicked so much better and even though on one hand it kinda hurts on the other it is nice to see them like that especially when the other one got hurt by her once best friend anyway thanks for reading what about you edit thank you everyone for replying each and every one of you i havent answered to everybody sometimes i dont know what to say but i have read all the comments i love you all ps i dont know what this silver plate is but i guess thank you kind stranger i hope you are doing fine all of you,post-pandemic

it happens a lot like really a lot almost every week i do a lot of online flirting and things go well then the women ask how big my dick is i tell them the truth its small immediately ignored yeah i know it may seem trivial to you but i wish someone would understand i challenge any guy to live what i live through it must be so easy for normal guys to flirt they probably just send the girls their penis pic yeah i get ignored immediately when i admit my size been rejected a lot over it girls have literally told me they wouldnt be with me over this it makes me very depressed and sucidical at times i think its below average and its thin some days im happy some days im sad not a day goes by when i dont think of it and all the rejection it really messes with a persons mind and please no advice like those women are shallow because i can understand it its natural biology for women to like penis and be sexually attracted to a man just like a man does find things in a woman attractive this part hurts the most because i cant even be angry with these women its like im stuck in a hopeless pit i crawl out every now and then but then i meet a woman and rejection hits and i fall in again and i know theres many ways to pleasure a woman but still i feel its not enough a woman will always naturally crave cock no matter how much i do for her she will always want a cock if im in a relationship with one she would probably miss cock and cheat or something my penis is really fucked up my life is fucked what do i do please realistic advice this time no rainbow sprinkles reddit because that shit isnt gonna happen im not good enough women like penis,pre-pandemic

warning this post will offend someone i have utterly stopped giving a shit about women because in all the situations i have been a part of witnessed or otherwise have read about a depressed woman can still be in a functional relationship depressed women are allowed to be aggressive violent or otherwise behave in a way thats disgraceful simply because men are expected to be the loadbearers in society and exist solely to take abuse my mom abused me and my dad is indifferent is this the same for every relationship no its not however it is perfectly fine for a depressed female to hit scream claw and spit at her spouse because oh shes depressed and she needs to have an outlet for her episodes a man is depressed suddenly hes unattractive not worth your time or needs to suck it up and be a man this hurts both sides im sorry but as a depressed male i am not allowed to be sad because my depressed face looks very intimidating and scary if youre an effeminate male great you have people willing to be affectionate with you i have not been hugged in years yes i am aware this sounds incredibly onesided and sexist thats because i dont care anymore,pre-pandemic

i am going to enter the dating scene despite being depressed i havent dated in over a year though it cannot possibly be ok to just be alone all the time just for the sake of being alone with my thoughts people say i should focus on myself join hobbies travel work on my career get new friends i can do all these things and when things fail or succeed i have friends to turn to but i ultimately experience life alone no one is keeping track of what is happening seeing my growth downfalls and growth again in closeness of me i havent had a partner since i was 18 im almost 23 maybe it will be easier to do things with someone by my side it doesnt have to be romantic i guess though thats a plus but a mutually beneficial relationship i think i have a lot to offer despite this disorder which clogs my brain eta i tried for the longest time to tell myself i shouldnt date because i dont want to burden someone with whatever i have too this is never going away,post-pandemic

i know im probably preaching to the choir and everything im about to say are textbook definitions of having depression but its a wednesday and thats therapy day and i dont have it in me to drive 30 minutes to talk to a man about how i feel sad and empty for 45 minutes only to drive 30 minutes home and its sad i used to enjoy going to therapy it was very cathartic and helped my anxiety and it still is i just dont have the desire to go it feels exhausting and i dont know how im going to get myself home after most mornings i can get out of bed today i set a record for 10 am usually its 1200 i can usually shower but sometimes doing things as simple as brushing my teeth or taking my medication feels like the biggest task my mom broke her wrist a few weeks ago and had surgery this means weve all been pitching in to help her but then my depression hit and i had a bout of sleepless nights and lately caring for her has felt like a chore when it really isnt my mom is my best friend and i love her more than life itself but i feel like that lyric from numb little bug like you have empathy inside but you dont really care i dont do things for her out of frustration or pity i care for her because i love her and want to help her be comfortable but i hate the ugly feeling inside of me that inwardly sighs or groans when she asks for help for things that make total sense and maybe its because taking care of myself feels like a chore so i cant imagine caring for someone else more than i would myself i cry a lot im quick to anger i have more selfish thoughts i dont have any interest in reading books or doing puzzles or meeting up with friends i dont even go to church anymore the one place that felt safest outside of home i have friends that havent seen me in months i take things out of proportion depending on the person for example my sisters boyfriend hes alright but in my personal opinion hes not the one for her however ive always respected my sister and her choices and have always treated him with respect and kindness but he can have a temper with people that arent her and hes said and done things that i often wonder if ive made too big a deal out of i often feel like sitting in bed and rotting away i feel like that john mulaney quote ill keep all my emotions right here and then one day ill die im surviving in every sense of the word i havent felt like ive thrived in a long time and i dont know what to do,post-pandemic
i f18 am just angry and frustrated that yesterday my brother m20 left a note explaining that he was gone and had killed himself my whole family was upset we all went out and looked for him and eventually he just came home at around 2 am and immediately my mum took him to a mental health facility hugged him and told him she loved him im not mad at him i understand hes struggling and were doing our best to support him im just mad that less than a year ago when i had began self harming and had attempted suicide everyone in my family told me that i was overreacting on my period or to get over it my brother especially told my parents not to take it seriously and that i was seeking out attention my mum yelled at me too when she found out asking me if i really wanted to die like that not even hugging me just yelling at me until i apologized but when out of nowhere he wants to kill himself they book him into a mental health ward get him specialty treatment everything he wants and are treating him so nicely am i a bad person for feeling angry that i wasnt why is his life more important than mine,post-pandemic

i dont like posting here its nothing against anybody that posts here but this subreddit gives off a certain aura thats foul it feels like a public bathroom thats never been cleaned i apologize if youre eating right now thats a disgusting visual my age is of little importance i will tell you that i am a man i suppose society would call me young but if you ask me i feel like ive been alive for way longer than i actually have i dont feel very young i desperately hope nobody i know reads this if they do ill have more bullshit to deal with every summer i attend a family reunion its been going on for longer than ive been alive at least i think it has id do some research but that isnt information worth having in any event its a tradition a family member of mine sent out an email asking everybody what date would work for everybody weve settled on a date that i am not going to share because it isnt relevant as i kept reading the email i saw that two of my cousins were pregnant at that moment i felt very badly about myself like really badly at this age i dont know if having offspring is the wisest choice for me to make theres something telling me im wrong about that but i think thats just the part of my psyche that wants to propagate the species on the other side of that coin nobody i repeat nobody has shown me even a sliver of the affection that would allow two people to come together and bring a life into this fucked up world on the one hand i can internally tell my family members to go fuck themselves and continue on a path that somehow spites them for being pregnant that does not seem logical then on the other hand it could be that im perceived as such a goddamn asshole that nobody even wants anything to do with me sadly id be willing to accept the latter all of these posts about your girlfriends and your boyfriends feel like everybody is collectively laughing at me this post was all over the place wasnt it im not sure if any of it makes sense i hope it does thanks for your time it is sincerely appreciated have a good one,pre-pandemic

it just seems so strange to me that most people dont spend every waking moment hating themselves and thinking about death like while theyre waiting for the train what do they think about if not jumping on the tracks and ending it right there or seeing a building and wondering if the impact of jumping from it will be enough to kill them do they just look at a tree with strong branches and think what a nice tree that is instead of which branch would be best to hang myself from how is it possible that some people just dont want to die not to mention so many people who go through painful and expensive treatments just to stay alive it makes me feel so guilty for all the times ive wished to get cancer so i can die without having to do anything i wish i could donate my physical health to someone who needs it so i can just let my sick brain shrivel up and die,pre-pandemic

i know its better to convince yourself that youre in control and things can get better but i cant agree with that the person i am is exactly the same as how i was when i was 5 years old literally since we were children you could tell my brother was going to be a chad and id be a weird friendless outcast so how am i supposed to change myself when everything is predetermined i cant get a solid friend group because im unlikeable i cant get a desirable girlfriend because the only women i can attract are ones with serious mental healthself esteem issues those kind of girls treat me like a god but i dont feel anything from it because ive experienced it dozens of times its all rigged anyway i watched this movie paddleton the other day and the ending has made me terrified of death so i cant kill myself or maybe that means i dont want it enough,pre-pandemic
i was diagnosed with adhd and depression when i was sixteen i grew up in a very neurodiverse home with three family members being autistic and the other five having addadhd at the beginning i never realized the toll it was going to take on me to go through middle school and high school while trying to navigate my adhd at the same time i flunked out of the majority of my classes i was called lazy unorganized and not going anywhere in life by the majority of my teachers i started to believe what they thought about me was true that i was stupid and not smart so from a very early age it planted a seed of insecurity that i carried inside me throughout my teenage years it was hard to maintain relationships and i got spun into a vicious cycle of depression and anxiety because i never felt accepted by anyone it resulted in me making harmful decisions that hurt me physically and that would negatively impact my future i turned to unhealthy habits to try and cope i wouldnt wish that type of loneliness on anybody now im creating a business to help others gain an outlet,post-pandemic

my wife and i started getting into cuckolding a year or 2 ago after 4 years of very happy marriage i believe during those 1st 4 years we saw each other as equals one of her 2 main bulls has become very authoritative he likes to command both me and my wife around which we both find so hot but i think my wife is genuinely losing respect for me as she sees me jumping to obey him the other night they were in bed together as i just kind of waited in the other room when i heard my wife yell theres no way im doing that its gross get your little girlfriend to do it they then called me in and he requested i lick his ass in front of my wife so i knelt behind him and started licking thinking it was so hot but i looked up at my wife after a couple minutes and just saw absolute disgust on her face i think that was the nail in the coffin for her now i can tell even when there are no bulls around she thinks of me as lesser she gives me commands and i do them in an attempt to please her this is no longer a marriage of equals she lets me know how things are going to be and i follow i cant decide if i find this hot or this is a path to destruction last night she got back from a long day and said she wanted her ass licked while she was on her laptop i obviously really wanted to so bad but didnt want to always jump to her every command so said i wasnt in the mood and just wanted to relax she absolutely ridiculed me for licking his ass but not hers calling me a sissy etc by the end of her rant i was begging to let me lick her back there but she wouldnt let me and called over her bull i felt so incredibly dumb for not giving her what she wants based off stupid male pride i talked with our bull about maybe being less mean and commanding of me and i got sure sure but nothing has changed fast forward to an hour ago and pretty much everything is gone she left me for him and ended it via text i feel terrible,pre-pandemic
today is the third day of my first episode of the year monday i wanted to die i went to work and it got worse over the day i fantasized about ramming my car into the guard rails the whole way home and only didnt because my wife and beau friend were texting me about their days they dont know about the suicidal ideation this time but know about my past attempts and depression yesterday i was locked in bed i woke up at 2 am and laid there alternating between disassociation and crying until 530 am when i reached over and woke my wife up to tell her i couldnt go to work i was locked there until 1 pm when i finally could get up to pee and eat a bagel i ordered delivery cookies and cried as i ate them last night my wife asked me to go to dinner with her mom i hate that woman and we talked about my wifes work situation and my wife thought i agreed with her mom we fought my wife cried for hours as we made up and talked i researched suicide by helium i dont want to die with a bag over my head i reminded myself of the lethal dosage of benadryl and we went to sleep this morning i told myself if i could move then i had to go to work i daydreamed about benadryl overdose as i made breakfast and coffee and got ready and left 20 minutes late i made it one third of the way there before i caught myself eyeing the guard rails again i swerved once just barely and decided to get off on the next exit and call into work i was doing better i went to the psychiatric hospital only 3 months ago i did the treatments in and out patient i was stable and on a medication that worked but it was the holidays no psychiatrist in my area and under my insurance was available to consult and refill it i got an emergency refill but no calls back and i tried i called all of them i checked the out of pocket fees that i cant afford i actively tried they werent taking new patients it took until two weeks ago to get a consult for february 26th ive been spiraling after being off my medication for 1 month i dont want to live anymore and if im going to be dependent on a medication refill that isnt guaranteed for the rest of my life its only a matter of time before i kill myself anyways how can i face my wife today having left for work and going straight back home a failure i should just get this over with because its bound to happen eventually,post-pandemic

when youre 18 you can make mistakes you have the time to fix them they dont define the rest of your life you have a decade to build a life for yourself there is always that hope that one day things might turn out well for you there is excitement life is full of colour but off in the distance you see a storm and road in greyscale then you turn 30 and suddenly the road ahead that looked dark and stormy ahead of you is the road youre now walking down and all you can see is darkness for the next 50 years of your life nobody is coming to save you or bail you out i would give anything to go back and do things over but there is no reset button you cant start a new save file all you can do is turn off the game for people in their late teensearly twenties dont waste a moment appreciate the time you are living in and the fact that you have several important years to work with they disappear without warning and one day it will hit you like a fucking dump truck in the chest that you have lost them forever,pre-pandemic

i was diagnosed with general anxiety disorder when i was 12 or 13 i take medication for it klonopin and for the most part i have it under control i havent had a severe attack in months so i was really surprised today to hear my pcp primary doctor tell me that he thinks im depressed and that hes worried that im killing myself his reason that ive lost weight since my last visit keep in mind that he told me earlier this year that i should gain fifteen pounds i managed to gain seven before leveling off i guess i lost eight since then because according to my doctor i am now severely underweight according to many websites im close to the normal range 112lbs to 126lbs for my height and body type i dont look like a skeleton or anything but my doctor was very blunt he said i had to gain weight and he actually said i should stop joggingexercising until i do i think he thinks im anorexic or something but im not i dont know what to think now he suggsted at the end that i should discuss the possibilty that im depressed with my psychiatrist i dont really want to do that sorry for rambling im high as hell right now,pre-pandemic
people are only just starting to understand depression but its usually depression thats making you stay in bed all the time or not eat i always feel like people think im lazy or i even question whether i have depression i exercise regularly go to uni eat well cook a lot of fresh meals for myself socialise and work but i had to cut my hours because i had a breakdown i find it hard to make it into uni my attendance is awful ill flake on plans to socialise sometimes because of the lethargy and anxiety of leaving the house i have days where im like a zombie everything is boring to me and i have a hollow chest feeling all day i feel heavy and i kind of feel like im trying to run through deep water but nobody really expects this from a depressed person it seems like i get through life just fine because i do get through life but its actually much harder than it seems edit didnt expect this to get the amount of attention it has im reading every comment and im trying to reply to all of them thank you for responding feels good to know this isnt as uncommon as i thought hope other people find comfort in that too edit 2 still reading every comment just wanted to share something that might be helpful i downloaded an app called moodnotes cost about 3 you can log your mood each day which is useful if youre trying to map your mood changes and identify thinking traps etc im not advertising or anything i dont even know if this is allowed but it has been massively helpful for me its nice to have a bit of balanced reflection each day,pre-pandemic

i 19f have been recently been diagnosed with major depression disorder and i felt like this was going to happen its all started when i was child my family was not the best when it comes to being emotionally involved with kids since i lived in a immigrant household im the oldest child and so they had high expectations for me mainly my mother unfortunately i did not meet these expectations and so i was labeled as lazystupid and other kind of hurtful words i felt like the least favorite compared to my other siblings and i still do to this day my mother was and still is the worst person when it comes to being emotionally involved i have many memories of her being cruel to me and my siblings whether its her telling one of my siblings to go kill themselves because they told the counselor that they were sad telling me and my siblings that we are ugly being stubborncriticize with our decision making etc my family never supported me going to therapy or taking medication since in their eyes i never experience real trauma even though ive self harm myself multiple times i found out that i was molested by my female cousin when i was a child my nudes has been posted on the internet without my knowledge or consent for money dealing with bullying from my peers and teachers dealing with insecurities with not only my body but my skin color as well and being in the closet as bisexual ive felt like i had nobody around me the only place i can run to was my brain and my imagination for the past 19 years and now due to experiencing suicidal thoughts i have now reached a dead end im on antidepressants but still i dont feel like its helping me i barely talk to my friends anymore i start college in less than three weeks and i dont even have a car i dont even have a job and seeing all my peers experiencing life more than me is just enough to make me want to kill myself i have no goals in life and i dont know what to do i want to give life a chance but if society hates me why should i keep living,post-pandemic
so im most probably getting to the worst point right now with thoughts every now and then of ending it self harm with also seeing new methods with less damage but im also loosing myself i feel completely different to who i used to be like i dont even know myself anymore i feel like everything is false and i dont even know what makes me happy anymore without the bad thoughts coming in my relationship with my family is being affected as me and my brother have started to drift apart as he constantly insults me and even today when i just stood up for my mum he said i suggest yoo dont come round next time and that i have an attitude issue and always miserable my family arent good at dealing with it and yes i have spoken to them about my brother and they said theyll defend me but they dont work is treating me awfully atm and to be honest sest im struggling on reasons to live i dont wanna exist anymore,post-pandemic

call me a bitch and all but who the fuck intentionally downvotes a post by someone who is struggling andor just venting the only probable cause i could see in doing that is if the person is attacking somebody else or saying hateful things but my god some of you are like a cancer on some of these folks who honestly have nowhere else to turn or have nobody in life and its really sad to see that a majority of these posts arent 100 upvoted when i could think of no reason as to why they deserve a downvote but i guess theres always gotta be that asshole right sorry for ranting just gets on my nerves when i see broken people on here possibly getting more shredded by the thought of somebody downvoting their post,pre-pandemic
best year of my life i felt like i was on top of the universe i felt genuine happiness for the first time discovering incredible new things and falling in love with them literally having once in a lifetime experiences being so confident in myself my greatest memories sadly it didnt last and at some point not long after my life just completely fell apart now the year that gave so much to my life is nothing more than a distant relic of my past slowly drifting further and further away from me i cant believe its been eight years now these days im constantly crying myself to sleep from thinking about what a hot mess my life has become seeing everything i loved with a passion back then now fighting on life support wanting to return to that time like nothing else i would give anything literally anything to be able to wipe my memory and live that year again even if it was just for one day so i could experience real happiness again,post-pandemic

i feel like the majority of my life so far was a movie of events just happening all leading up to the final end to the movie of me killing myself i would just die and i would never have to get to this part of life it would just happen like that but now i feel like i missed that chance and my movie is still going but the rest of the movie wasnt planned out because it shouldve ended with my death so the story is just improvised and now i feel even more lost and unmotivated than before because in all honestly i feel like i tried so hard with school and activities and work etc as one final push before i would kill myself but then i never went through with it and now ive given up trying on work and stuff i dont know whether others feel this way but maybe in another alternate reality i did kill myself at the right time and thats why i feel so wrong because i didnt who knows,pre-pandemic

even when i think something is going okay it goes wrong i cant seem to catch a break and im starting to lose my mind its been like this my entire life but the past year has been especially brutal 1 i got kicked out of my dads house this time last year and was homeless for a week before i found someone who would rent to me in a pinch my childhood dog died during this and i feel like i wasnt able to properly mourn the house turned out to be extremely old none of the electrical outlets worked and the ac didnt work in florida so i had to use a window unit in my bedroom for about two weeks before the landlord fixed the ac i had to run a huge extension chord across the house from the only outlet that worked to my room 2 the landlord was a super rich lady from up north who basically bought this crappy manufactured home sight unseen because it was on a beautiful river down here she ended up coming down and staying in the spare room a couple times a month eventually she started letting one of my male neighbors who was a drug addict stay in the spare bedroom when she wasnt there as a female in my 20s this was super sketchy and i ended up propping my desk chair under my bedroom doorknob every night to make sure he couldnt get in cuz the door didnt lock i woke up to him shining a flashlight by the front door which was right by my bedroom door in the middle of the night multiple times for no reason 3 i ended up moving out shortly after this and moved in with my only two friends all was fantastic for a few weeks and then my job laid me off this was a super easy remote job and i was devastated i went on unemployment which is awful in fl and barely scraped by because i had no savings i barely got by during this period i dont know how i did it honestly lots of debt 4 i ended up landing a new job that i hate its literally the opposite of my ideal job and i am miserable every single day i dread waking up for work im working as an auto claims adjuster as somebody with extreme social anxiety and i have to talk to angry people all day every day and the workload is unbelievable i end up needing to work almost 2 hours overtime every day and im still behind and im not paid for it because its salary 5 the house i moved into with my best friends is a 2 bedroom condo with a studio attachment my friends both lived in the condo before i moved in and then the person in the studio moved out one of my friends moved from my new room to the studio and i took his old room it was great for the first 5 months that i lived here then my friend in the studio could no longer afford rent and moved in with his boyfriend 6 the landlords cousin moved back into the studio hes the one who moved out in the first place i share a wall with the studio and its very thin this guy slams around all day and night slams doors has loud people over constantly he has two young kids that are there every weekend who scream all night long and bang against the wall i am extremely stressed about the noise and ive tried talking to him about it and it wont stop hes the landlords cousin so they wont do anything about it 7 ive been applying non stop to new jobs so i can leave this position that im miserable at my brother suggested that i lie about my employment dates to fill in some gaps he said that everyone does it and i thought nothing of it because these jobs dont care about us one job i put that i worked at for way way longer than i did years anyways i got hired and it turns out that this job does a thorough background check theyre contacting me for all my info i was an idiot filling out the background form and consented to all my previous employers being contacted and now theyre verifying my dates which are lies i also lied a bit about college nothing major just that i have an aa which i have the credits for i just never applied for the diploma so as soon as they confirm that i lied my offer is going to be rescinded 8 i co signed on my dads vehicle when i was 19 and stupid he ended up going 30 days late a few days ago and it ran my already average credit into the dirt 9 im slowly losing contact with all of my friends and my tiny toxic family i have nobody the only person i talk to is my roommate who doesnt even seem to like me that much even though i do consider her a friend im losing my mind im stressed and depressed and just want to end things im lonely and unhealthy and ready to pull my hair out i dont know what to do im tired of the constant tears and emotional turmoil,post-pandemic

i hate the saying suicide is selfish because no one ever congratulates you for staying alive for others despite how fucking exhausting it is to simply exist ive been depressed for past several years but one thing ive always had is my family which im grateful for and also ashamed to be depressed because how fucking dare i not be happy with all i have anyway ive purposely hid this from them because i dont want them to think of me as anything but the class clown type whos always seemingly upbeat and has his life together the fascade is exhausting ive wanted to die for a while but simply cannot bear to put my folks through especially my younger brothers who wouldnt even understand maybe this is enough maybe this will push me through until i get better,pre-pandemic
the first part of my soul is old and wise the part thats been through pain heartbreak death and disease that part is the one thats been depressed for 3 years and has been living with a painful chronic illness for 4 that part has broken hearts and has been heartbroken thats the part that has seen those around me die its the part of me thats a 90yearold woman who has experienced life and gotten everything out of it she can and is now ready to die then theres the part of me thats still a 16yearold girl the part thats still trying to figure out life and is full of happiness and curiosity the part that wants to stay up all night go to college and get drunk the part that is innocent and doesnt know a whole lot about life the part that still gets excited to do things most of the time the 16yearold girl can take over and convince the 90yearold woman that there are still things worth living for but sometimes the 90yearold takes the reigns and makes the 16yearold think that life has been experienced enough now and its time to go,pre-pandemic

i would say its simple for now i can say that im a high quality employee of my country i have my girl who we have a plan about marriage everything is great our relation is great my status in society is either good or better everything is great but my ex always comes back to me either when i see some faces or in my dream i saw her every 23 weeks we would have a happy life in my dreams i would say that in junior to high school i was a loser until my ex and first came to my life she was the best stand for me from everyone even my family everyone including even now i learn to over come my best trauma i forgave her for what she did to me before she left the great problem is i can remember how great she was in my life i dont know when it went wrong what in the great world world made this happen why and why she would be the best of my life and she left me i tried to understand that it may be because its meant to be right but sure its my faults who else respond for it she is the best in my life and we will never get back together it feels like the best of my life is gone i would never be confident encouraged and everything else as when she was there when i realize this what is my point of living i cant end it because those who stay with me what to learn when the im still keep seeing her there even in my dream and everywhere else ps sorry this is my first post but im may be at the end of my threat i can select new some but its 7 years that she left and i cant overcome it so what would be a point for my future people around me praise as a smart but most of 80 time i just hope that im not that smart to think about these anymore sleeping is hurting me seeing people or event is hurting me,post-pandemic

dear depressed redditors i wanted to share my story of my fall into a black hole of depression my struggle to find good treatment and then the ultrahigh speed2 week recovery i experienced i hope this story gives some hope to those that are struggling that getting better doesnt need to take months or years happy to answer any questions as well in college i was a fairly happy person however my senior year i had a personal crisis and fell into a dark hole of depression there were days i didnt want to get out of bed and pretty soon days turned into weeks i was struggling to complete my classes and ended up taking a leave of absence from stanford where i was enrolled i was in this horrible place for a few months during this time i tried all kinds of treatments to get better i tried antidepressants exercise 2 different talk therapists long conversations with friends trips to see family and many other things i was diligently searching for effective help but nothing i tried was very helpful and after months of searching i wasnt any better off than i was at the start of my exploration of mental health services finally by complete good luck i was referred to matthew may a psychiatrist on the adjunct faculty at stanford who was practicing a new cutting edge form of therapy called team therapy i went to see matt and in just a few weeks doing twice a week two hour sessions my depression vanished i felt completely better and in fact was able to experience loads of joy and happiness i can imagine this might strike many people as too good to be true and honestly i was in a state of disbelief myself having been cured so quickly of a problem that i had struggled with for months this new therapy is super awesome and i feel lucky i chanced into finding it but its not widely known ask me any questions note for those interested in an app for this new therapy after i enrolled back in school i reached out to the creator of this new team therapy who is a fairly well known psychiatrist named david burns dr burn is an adjunct emeritus professor of psychiatry at stanford and is well known in therapy circles for his bestselling book feeling good which was published in the 1970s and popularized cognitive behavioral therapycbt i was curious if he was interested in creating digital selfhelp tools leveraging the team model but for a variety of reasons the time wasnt right after spending 10 years as an engineer and product manager i reconnected with david and weve decided to build a new selfhelp app using the team model the model has become even more refined and powerful and the results are often astounding there are many examples now of people recovering from their depression in just a few hours of live therapy on davids podcast we are hoping our app can be an awesome new tool for people struggling with depression we are looking for beta testers if you are interested you can sign up here,pre-pandemic
when i was super young 5 or 6 i used to see this concept of a lonely person having an imaginary friend in cartoons often i always found it odd now after i ruined all my friendships and my relationships with my family due to my insanely unstable mind which lead to me being a very toxic person so i isolated to stop dealing with that and the lack of motivation which is making me fail in school i feel completely hopeless i have no future i have no friends and no hobbies i dont enjoy doing anything and i feel like my head is being poisoned everyday my only relief is an imaginary person who tells me its not my fault and that it will get better i spend hours everyday dissociating and spending time with them we talk and we laugh and they hug me when im upset i cry on their shoulder i feel so pathetic i know im a bad person and i know im not entitled to other peoples love and care which is why i chose to make this character in my head i dont see the point in doing this any longer i have no future i will try to survive till the summer,post-pandemic

atm is somewhat glib because in truth it has on average been much more now than just a moment moments there are still though im much improved i must admit it can be oddly hard to admit that i think as if some gremlin apologist for depression sits upon your shoulder convincing you that youre just as poorly off as before that youre just as under threat i full expect a return to bad times if only to protect myself from disappointment something you dont need more of when restricken with depression but for a couple months now ive been able to breathe alright i dont post this to brag but i recall appreciating such posts when i was rotting in those abominable depths so um like said posts many ended with something encouraging andor uplifting so er heres my attempt at that your soul isnt gone you just need to work on object permanence what you know to be true ie that youll never feel anything other than what you do now is not true pride stubbornness desire for continuing emotional selfvalidation or denial out of blind selfdefense against that actuality must be recognized as such put in its proper place of realityirrelevant compulsions how you feel now is temporal determining reality with your own faculties is one of the few possessions people really have which is why its so hard for them to give it up in the face of depression when you have so little of yourself already but understand this you are not to be trusted right now the state of your brain renders you unfit to judge the true implications of your present condition any conclusion derived and held fast to about the bleakness of your future should be regarded as dismissively as a medieval doomsayer slicked in filth ranting in his tattered robes about end times and repentance knowing how idve read the above two paragraphs i realize how little i may be able to convince any of you ever messages contrary to roaring horror whilst in depressions throes are met with incredulity with yes yes but this does not apply to me my suffering is special it is not and lending further undue credence to the arguments presented in the court of your mind which are rigged against depressions opposition anyway is a product of being brainwashed by your sorrow and keening misery im sorry you feel those things but fuck you youre wrong and not everythings doomed,pre-pandemic

ive been with my girlfriend for 4 years she knows about my depression and has tried to help me through it a few months ago i was on the verge of killing myself i couldnt bear living my life the way it was anymore instead i cheated i had an affair i felt overwhelming guilt but i felt less depressed it made me feel alive it lasted 3 months until i couldnt handle the guilt anymore and i broke it off since then ive been trying my best to treat my girlfriend the way she deserves but im as depressed as ever and now the girl i had the affair with wants to start up again i want to say no but i dont see a point in living if i do i dont think i would survive without my girlfriend either if i thought it would cause her less pain if i killed myself then i would but i think it would make it worse for her especially if the affair came to light has anyone else been in a similar situation cheating as a means of escape,pre-pandemic
she wasnt sure what was making me upset but she wanted to scare it off getting a dog hasnt cured my depression but she sure has made it easier to deal i love this dog,pre-pandemic
ive never posted anything online before so ill try to be succinct im 43 male never married no kids on medical leave from my job for depression im so disappointed in the person ive become no matter how much i read or do its like i have not gained any wisdom on managing lifes challenges i grew up in a loving home with lots of encouragement and high expectations i was an a student through college but my social skills have always been lacking i managed to work for the past 20 years but i couldnt keep up in my current job hence the medical leave ive been in therapy for much of the past 10 years my psychologist believes i have traits of avoidant personality disorder i take several antidepressants and im currently two weeks into tms therapy nothing seems to help im unbelievably critical of myself even now as i write this message i am certain that this will be the worst written message ever on reddit ive been reading hundreds of other posts and they seem so well written im even more amazed by the responses how are you all able to find the words to share your wisdom and advice i read everything i can find on overcoming depression and avoiding suicide but it goes right through me and outv the other end with nothing retained i cant imagine giving advice to someone there is so little i can think of to say to people in distress im a mess right now i have lost hope of getting better i dont exercise i sleep 14 hours a day i have a house but i spend most nights at my parents nothing traumatic has ever really happened to me the worst thing is that my exgirlfriend cheated on me three years ago and i havent dated since i have some solid friends that ive known since high school they are all very well adjusted and have careers and families of their own i cant seem to learn anything these days i used to be smart but i am not longer able to learn new things i cant imagine surviving another 40 years i think about volunteering but i even tell myself that i have nothing valuable to offer ive no real skills to rely on i have saved about 300k in my 20 years of work i had saved that money so that i could support having a family some day i no longer think im capable of having a family too overwhelming i would be an awful spouse and father i dont plan to go back to work i plan to just live on my savings as long as i can and then end my life by then my parents will be gone and i wont hurt them my siblings and friends will be hurt in the nearterm but they will be ok in the long run ive read so much on coping with this disease but so little spurs me to action until last year im was microdosing with weed every morning to get myself going keeping up with job and social occasions the weed stopped working for me though now if i smoke it gives me some paranoia that makes things worse thanks for reading all this i love you,post-pandemic
i already promised my family and made arrangements for my cat if i dont do this im not gonna make it ive fought this for so long and im tired edit some of my arrangements took longer than planned so now it got pushed back a day and i go in about 18hrs im just building past the anxiety of actually walking through those doors,post-pandemic
just woke up and this was the first thing that came to my mind,pre-pandemic
tldr im not depressed and i dont really understand much about the condition but whenever i think over how to help people with depression i struggle with the idea that depressed people shouldnt be catered to how do i treat people i am close to when they are in a depressed state maybe this concept wont go over well but i want to get some perspective on the idea that many depressed people were conditioned to be depressed by the people around them i feel like people need to take responsibility for their own attitude towards life in general everyone has bad periods in their life and may be sad for an extended period of time but if a person allows that period to extend for an unreasonably long time it is their own fault and those around them should hold the depressed person accountable when i was a child sometimes i was sad and depressed and in some cases my parents would reach out to me when i was in that state if i tried to milk that more than was reasonable the emotional support from those around me would stop i wasnt allowed to be depressed all day if i wanted to get along with my family instinctually i tried to get what i wanted by being sad and i had to have some hard lessons growing up to condition that behavior out of me i feel like some people who are depressed may not have gotten enough of those experiences to say to themselves you know what being sad isnt going to get me anywhere so i need to change my attitude and genuinely believe that idea maybe my ideas of depression are backwards and obviously they dont apply to everyone with depression but i struggle when dealing with people around me when they are in depressedsad states do i give them emotional support and try to make them feel better and when that doesnt help at what point to i stop coddling them and be supportive but not enabling,pre-pandemic
i just need someone to talk to my friends and family arent doing anything to help me i feel like nothing a puce of trash that nobody cares about i just need some human interaction even if its online,post-pandemic
i was just admitted back into college i am about to finish enrollment soon snd i am scheduled to start school on the 1st of march this is all a facade for my family i will die before i graduate i am a 24 year old below average male dying young has always been a fantasy of mine i refuse to live a life of 40 years of loneliness and misery misery is inevitable if i choose to give myself false hope and stay alive i am unfixable i have cancelled therapy and stopped taking medication i made up some bs lie to my therapist about wanting to put my full focus on school resulting in me cancelling my therapy plan what i will actually do is withdraw money out of my 401k to buy a shotgun the fact that im even contributing to a 401k knowing full well i will die very soon is actually really funny come to think of it,post-pandemic
hey everyone im a 26yearold and im hoping to share my recent experience and get some advice im feeling really scared about whats been happening to me lately for the past month or so ive been dealing with some intense dizziness vertigo and blurry vision but yesterday something really terrifying happened and im not sure if it was a panic attack or what i was out driving i work as a driver and everything seemed normal at first then out of nowhere i had this overwhelming feeling like everything around me was unreal like i was in a movie or something my vision got super blurry and i started feeling like i was losing control of my bodyi even started shaking and my hands got really itchy i pulled over got out of the car and ended up taking off all my clothes except for my shorts even though it was freezing outside i couldnt feel the cold at all the vertigo got worse and i was afraid i was going to pass out i called my wife whos a nurse and she gave me a xanax 05mg after about 4050 minutes the shaking stopped and my vision improved but when i tried to get out of bed i felt really dizzy again i managed to sleep okay that night but when i woke up and went outside i started questioning reality againwas this all a movie am i dying when i got back home things got a bit better but im still feeling off last week i got a full blood workup and everything came back fine except for slightly low hdl cholesterol still within the normal range just on the lower side additionally my vitamin b12 iron magnesium and d levels were all perfect in the bloodwork i should mention that ive experienced similar episodes in the past but they were much milder lasting only 2030 seconds and never as intense as this after those episodes everything returned to normal could this be a problem with my vestibular system or inner ear or is it more likely psychological any advice would be greatly appreciated thanks,post-pandemic
i just got put on abilify after roughly twenty other medication failures in my life i said last time that i wouldnt try again but im at a very low point and desperate for anything to work after nearly committing myself for psychiatric help which ive never considered before my question is how do meds work for people who overthink and ruminate about problems that wont go away i still just dont understand what a medication can do to turn around someones thoughts if all you can think about is certain problems i know thats what therapy is for but if thats the case then whats the point of being medicated just frustrated and looking for insight,post-pandemic
at least for me ive hated how people say something like oh that person isnt actually depressed its just for attention i dont understand the whole complex between depression and attention but i do know nothing feels worse than being in a depressive episode and having nobody to talk to maybe it stems from that all i want is my best friend back for us to have real conversations again too bad i have self sabotaging tendencies but thats a story for another day i just dont want to feel completely alone anymore update i never expected so many people to resonate with this thanks for all the awards and support on this post it makes me feel slightly better that im not alone in this i hope everyone had a good valentines day,post-pandemic
i dont see the point in me going to another psychiatrist not now at least im 6 months pregnant and theyre not going to give me anything i can have or change what im on i dont know why but the last week has been hard i dont want to do anything i go to work i come homeand i wait for bed its a double edged sword because not doing anything or having nothing to do before bed gives me bad anxiety but i just dont have the motivation to do anything im at a point where i feel like this is itthis is how i will feel the rest of my life basically pregnancy is making me feel stuck in this miserable cycle yes im on medication safe for pregnancy and my husband unfortunately cant wrap his mind around it just go do something take up a hobby go out play games all i want to do is lay in bed,pre-pandemic

sorry this is super long i dont really have anyone to talk to and i just need to get this off my chest yesterday i had to say goodbye to someone for the last time i genuinely dont know if ill ever see him again and it is so deeply painful i love him so much and i know he loves me too no other guy has treated me the way he did i wish so badly we could have more time together hes still in school and going abroad to a different continent and wont be back on campus until next fall or spring ive graduated and want to leave our college city because im miserable here things havent been going the way i planned so its looking like i have to stay here for the time being id be able to handle it if he could be here with me because id have something good in this city but he cant im not jealous or angry im really very happy for him im just so sad we had a lovely date and then we had to say bye i asked him what now he said its a good thing that were going to live our separate lives start our next chapters and he was sad too but the minute he left i started sobbing and i cried myself to sleep and woke up from a nightmare and cried all day i wish i had something to look forward to like he does my depression is so severe ive completely lost the ability to care about the things i used to be passionate about ive been in survival mode and might have to go to inpatient soon i just want a relationship with him we had something amazing and the fact that we may never see each other again is just another knife in my back after a lifetime of good things being taken away from me i wish i wasnt depressed so i could see things the way he does i wish i could just happily reflect on the time we spent together and look forward to new beginnings i wish i could look back with pure gratitude i wish i wasnt so devoid of positive emotions that i can only feel them in the presence of someone else of course i am incredibly grateful he was in my life but i just want him forever and i feel empty and lonely and sad ive had horrific traumatic breakups but this hurts so much more because nothing went wrong were just in different places in life and im entrenched in my mental illness nothing went wrong we just had to say bye thats it no more texting no more jokes no more dates no more kisses nothing in my head i fantasize about being with him forever and i get so sad knowing eventually hell meet someone else and ill just be that girl from a long time ago the scent of his cologne has faded from my pillow ive been so numb these past few months but he made me feel so loved and beautiful and excited and now i feel an emptiness i havent felt in so long that kind of emptiness that makes your chest feel completely hollow i feel like im being played by the universe as if my life is just some sick joke every good thing has ended with me hurt and deeply unhappy and now its happened again im quite self aware and i dont think im being pessimistic but rather realistic my life especially in the past few years has just been trauma after trauma and the rare good things were always taken away from me i prayed to the god i dont believe in that this one thing would work but of course it didnt at this point i dont know why i expected anything else my false hope destroyed me yet again i would give up everything i own if it meant i could be healthy i just want the pain to stop,post-pandemic

if that doesnt prove that depression is one of the biggest illness to ever plague us then i dont know what will i really hope one day people would emphathise and know how it feels to live this way and how hard it is to open up and how small it feels to beg for a way out only to be ignored or shut down that too by people whom you would give your life for fuck this shit i hope i was born heartless and emotionless so i didnt care about these kind of people but i still love them even after they refused to help me i hope i die a miserable death it would only be fitting to the already cruel game someone is playing with me if i cower and fail to kill myself and live long enough to maybe make something of myself i promise to do everything in my power to eradicate or atleast help the people suffering from this,pre-pandemic
i feel like nothing ever changes for me and my anxiety makes it harder to even try to change things yes somewhere down the line it might be different but even still ive thought about traveling around the world forever but im thinking about it now and i really dont think itll be as fulfilling as i think it will i think that even though its one my dreams im still going to feel discontented wheneverif it happens i just feel like im going to feel alone and unsure forever no matter the situation sorry if this doesnt make sense i just wanted to talk and i dont have anyone i can say this to,post-pandemic

first off what a stupid fucking question to ask anyway what do you want to hear as the interviewer when you ask that question that im indifferent and stagnant enough to stay with your company that long assuming you hire me or that im ambitiously arrogant enough to in five years plan on being well passed this shit fuckin hell man undoubtedly there are varying degrees of suicidality just as there are reasons for doing it all depends on the person i suppose im the sloth suicidal ive tiptoed through and around depression for the better part of my conscious life and i cant help but feel miserable an overwhelming percentage of the time yet when the obvious solution to this conundrum of despising being alive is well dont be alive anymore the meddling safeguards of thinking about the wake of my actions swelling over everything and everyone i leave behind effectively whiteout any sort of blueprint i have for seeing myself out of my life sounds rather counterintuitive but id rather my last thoughts be more you gave it a go youre not doing anything wrong you do you kiddo and less hey youre a tremendous asshole for this i hope you know that i can comfortably say im not doing it tonight or tomorrow or this year or even the next but i genuinely feel like thats how im going out pending the absence of a freak car crash or lightning strike or some shit dont even really know what im trying to say here but do you ever feel like this like life is essentially an existential clusterfuck that you want no part of but for whatever fucking reason just cant make any sort of move afterthought cant help but laugh that when driveling on in this post i look up at the browser tab and it says submit to depression haha fuckin a,pre-pandemic
hi all i am new here so i am sorry if i violate any posting rules i wanted to ask the question in the title essentially and see if any others find themselves facing depressive episodes triggered by seeing people you care about depressedtriggeredanxious i first started dealing with depression in high school after dealing with a very serious life event and didnt know what it was at the time to seek treatmenttherapy fast forward 15 years and i still experience brief bouts of depression that can last 13 days recently however i have noticed that most of these episodes seem to be occur after people in my life that matter to me share their own troubles with mental health or difficulty in life i do my best to listen and be of help but afterward and even during these conversations i find myself monstrously depressed and borderline nonverbal i dont want to be a bad friendpartnerrelative but i am having a lot of difficulty shouldering other peoples problems i find myself yearning for simplicity and neatness and no longer desire to know the messy workings of other peoples lives but how do you say that without sounding like an asshole i feel doubly guilty trying to wash my hands of these matters because i genuinely come from a pretty privileged upbringing my parents were always uppermiddle class and though their marriage was a disaster they gave me an amazing childhood many people dont have that sort of background and so i feel its unfair for me to turn my back on them i am seeking any general advice or experience people might have here thanks so much,post-pandemic
its fucking hilarious coz my brain is broken but i also am so hurt but also it doesnte evne matter because its so fucking hilarious also taylor swift exists and that is good probably and i swear to god something but also not and nothing and just so fucking funny being completely depressed and unable to live,post-pandemic
i was texting a hotline when they accidentally sent me this you mentioned that coping skill worked in the past but isnt helping right now you deserve some peace what is a new source of strength you might try they then told me to ignore that last message and i called them out on it she admitted that they have to use scripts and pretyped messages when talking to people this is why being an american sucks the only free help you can get doesnt work suicide hotlines only exist because people like to pretend they work,post-pandemic
why are we women treated like this regardless of whether or not you are a democrat or a republican shouldnt people not just women get justice ive been obsessing over the whole kavanaugh issue i cant seem to get anything donethere are so many people in power or arent who are blatantly guilty and yet are not dished a punishment instead they are met with sympathy and are given free passes boys will be boys victims are treated like inconveniences and are blamed for being in situations assaults they never wanted to be in if you say youre a feminist and want equal rights between men and women you get called crazy and irrational if a man sides with womens rights movements they get made fun of why is that what is so wrong in being a feminist im talking a real feminism wanting everyone to be treated with equal dignity respect and offered the same opportunities when women get emotional and passionate they get called crazy and irrational when women keep their cool and act assertive they are called cunts or cold bitches but when men show such displays they are often perceived as credibly justified to behave the way they did they even get treated as if theyre victims of unjust blame when they are to be faced with the consequences of their actions imagine mrsford acted like kavanaugh and vise versa oh how the world would turn upside down all these issues are taking an emotional and mental toll on me and yet i cant stop following the news on this case i feel trapped in a reality that doesnt make any sense i feel as if i dont belong in anywhere because i can never feel safe how can i feel safe if we let people like kavanaugh get away with this shit let alone get nominated to be a sj how can i feel like i have a shred of control when the strongest person in the us the fuckin president is a predator himself i know people are gonna say innocent until proven guilty but also remember that we arent dumbasses we can see through the bullshit i started having more and more intrusive thoughts and flashbacks of my assaults i still thought about it every day even before the k hearing started since i still have physical damage from the assault but i was able to push through my day without the memories bringing me extreme emotional pain and irrational fear i was able to get shit done now my body jitters and i get muscle spasms and have a hard time calming down my heart rate i get nightmares and vivid dreams about the assault i keep thinking about how i too was treated like shit when i reported my second sexual assault i didnt report the first one because i was too scared of how i would be treated but then it kept bugging me and at the time hated myself for being so scared i was trapped and he violated me via penetration fingers i still remember how i was alone with him cornering me and i still remember how his breath stank from smoking cigarettes i remember how i pushed away and ran out i remember the song playing in the radio as i drove home while crying what i dont remember what the exact fuckin date was but it doesnt mean it didnt happen thats a fuck you to lindsey graham when i mentioned that i didnt report it 1st assault on a thread here on reddit several people told me that im just as guilty as my assailant because by not reporting his actions he will hurt other people and i am too selfish to do anything about it that made me even more miserable because at the time i believed them because i hated myself and was feeling damaged and disgusted with myself as if i was the rapist my second sexual assault was when i was at my dormitory and the person who assaulted me was also living on the same floor the person was generally liked by the people on our floor and so was i at least at the beginningthat person even before the assault was working their way into ruining my reputation spreading rumours about me on a couple of occasions other people on my floor saw the person being physically forceful with me and didnt do anything in fact they helped the asshole they blocked my way when i tried getting away the person literally dragged me and confined me in my dorm room and blocked the door they forced me to take off my clothes and oh how kind hearted they were had me change into sleep clothes right in front of them when i wanted to go to the bathroom the asshole forced themself into the stall and wont leave a couple of times i managed to run away from them and they literally chased me down and dragged me back to the room it was humiliating those couple nights two worst incidents by them they forced me to sleep in their bed and i remember crying as they felt me up they spread rumors about me and i was already going through my own kind of hell extreme family and financial issues i tried to commit suicide and i was forcefully detained to be completely honest the worst of my injuries were from my altercations while being detained so i wont say its assault the cops and staff involved were just doing their job but their actions mainly the hospital shit definitely made me and still makes me feel deeply violated it was my fault i was having a mental breakdown and while i didnt try hurting them i definitely put all i have in trying to runget away at the er i was held down by several male security guards as they strapped me down to the bed which gave me flashbacks and made me panic even more some patients were watching as i was strapped down and kept watching as a nurse came in to sedate me that ment they watched as i was manhandled and pinned by the guards had my pants and panties pulled down to get injected with antipsychotics of course everyone in my dormitory found out because that shit head predator stalked me and told everyone i came back to an atmosphere wherein some people acted as if i was invisible i pressed charges on that shit bag and people found out i had to give detailed descriptions of the assault to a male detective which was super uncomfortable people refused to support me by telling the detective they saw nothing but many of them saw me being dragged so forcefully that i had bruises the next day most stopped talking to me including friends a few called me disgusting others shook their heads in a condescending way when they saw me trying to explain myself as if its my fault as if i owed anyone anything with addition to all that a close family member passed away a couple weeks later i was given zero emotional support instead i was told to keep my grievance on low volume that stress caused me another mental breakdown in which i slit my wrists cops came i was put in a mental hospital for a couple of days but it only made me feel more exposed and violated i was forced to strip down in front of a female staff member she saw me completely naked as she inspected me then one of the lead staff who checked me in started being creepy with me asking a lot of unnecessarily sexual questions especially about my sexual assaults which seemed to make him pleased i dont even know how to describe it he asked me if i was dating anyone and kept calling me beautiful he was super touchy and told me about how good he is at making love it made me feel unsafe i felt extremely worthlessness he was enjoying and feeding off my pain i felt like a slab of meat and that i dont deserve any help when i came back from the mental ward and was still grieving and processing the never ending humiliation i was told that i should get over it not talk about it or leave the dormitory and live in a different hall so i shut my mouth and didnt say anything and there i was with no friends and feeling violated this week i was called by the detective and he told me no charges will be filed since it was a he said she said situation and did i mention how i needed to describe in extreme details my sexual assault well i did but still they got away with it and i was left exposed and deeply traumatized anyways for people who support people like brett and dismiss people like ford blindly just remember that coming forward about sexual assault isnt easy its invasive humiliating and scary even if you comply you get blamed for the actions of the predator as if you had control knowing if you report abuse right away which is completely up to the victim its possible to not be believed just remember that im one of many people by people i am including women men and children etc that suffered from the sexual abuse but also suffered from the the general lack of empathy and dignity from those we report it to you might know someone who was a victim of sexual abuse without even knowing it cheers,pre-pandemic

i feel like i have no urgency to have a life work sounds like a horrendous repetitive cycle i look at myself in the mirror and cant recognize myself i dont know who i am and i dont know if i ever will a person i love greatly recently implied some things behind my back that really impacted me personally after i had told them some shitty things that had happen to me very recently i have felt like people could care less about my issues as if they havent been continuous and life altering my grandma recently killed herself when i had just lost my other grandma a few months back my mom relapsed alcoholic after being sober for 6 months and brought her terrible excuse of a boyfriend over from another state after he was the reason she relapsed in her past and to add to everything i had someone i loved drove everywhere bought things for and supported emotionally begin to talk about my flaws and insecurities after i had told her everything being fully aware that i despised my attributes and appearance deeply adding fire to the flame but also not telling me to my face and rather to my other friends i dont feel like i have a support system that is reliable i have begged for a form of therapy and medication but havent had any luck future is looking bleak i dont know whats next and i dont know if i want to the only thing keeping me going is my few friends that as far as i know havent been backstabbing and my little siblings i worry they wont be enough soon it sounds selfish but the overwhelming urgency to die has been so overwhelming in the past months i havent felt much else ive been trying so hard to push it away but it claws at me always beckoning me to go through with it i get so sick of finally healing and everything crashing down as if the universe is testing me and seeing how much it can push me down before i take matters into my own hands in most terms i am a failure and i dont say it out loud but i can be a piece of shit i feel like a failure to society but also within a family role im failing classes dont have the will to do them even for the sake of my future doesnt feel like my future exists everyone had such high expectations for who i was gonna be being a smart kid but now im here no motivation no consistent passions or desires and a looming feeling of dread for my life,post-pandemic
im so sorry depressed women of reddit but i just have to get this out it feels so unfair that you are allowed to be depressed and sad everyone has feelings depressed peoples feelings dont work like your normal persons feelings we cant just man up and be okay its unfair that you can just stay at home just find a man that cares for you hell supply the family with everything because hes a man men dont stay at home or theyre loser and leaches of society its unfair that you just have boyfriends love doesnt heal your depression i would know from all these bfs ive had as a man you wont find someone online they are all superficial theres a ratio of 101 at best theres millions of cases where this isnt true and its great for all of you where it worked out but as a male it sometimes just feels so true,pre-pandemic
im having a really hard time keeping up with life especially since the lockdown started i just dont feel like i have anything to live for i do not want to be happy i just dont understand what happiness is to be completely honest that is not to say that im unhappy and miserable what im saying is that happiness and sadness has become the same thing for me i just cant separate the two on top of that theres this feeling of guilt i keep having about everything i am from a rich family people have always expected me to be on top of everything ever since i learned to walk but i was never able to be on top ive always sucked at everything i tried to be on top but never made it and so now im this 21 year old uni student and ive been hammered so much with that mindset of trying to get to be best at everything and since ive always failed at that i feel safer as a failure i just do not feel that i want to succeed ive become an emotional masochist sometimes i imagine that a loved one would come and choke me to death to put me out of this misery and leave me in a cold dead end where no one would ever come across again thats not to say im suicidal i am not i just like having those kinds of imaginations the only thing i do to keep my mind off of these feelings these days is that i listen to music even my genres are new age or shoegazing or doom metal which used to be uplifting epic music now im not going too much into that stuff but i hope ive made my point clear im not looking for concrete advice perhaps simply writing these down and sharing might help me a lot thank you for taking the time to read through this whole post i truly appreciate it,post-pandemic

my actual personality is over the top funin my opinion confident and kind but the depression teams up with social anxiety so that i just dont have enough enough energy to act like who i truly am i turn into this very flat monotone boring quiet person who i would never want to hang out with or date its the main reason i avoid social interaction now it feels humiliating because i feel like im perceived as this pathetic pitiable ignorable person when im feeling better and have a little more energy i can act like myself but usually im just this shell its horrible like watching the progression of als in a loved one they just slowly fade away until theres nothing left of who they used to be at least with physical illness or bipolar or whatever you have yourself that fundamental spark of who you truly are and youre able to show that and share that with others i dont even have that privilege sorry if this comes off as arrogant or insensitive this is just how i feel edit guys thanks so much for all the responses i appreciate all of you i didnt know so many people felt the same way and im glad if i was able to help give voice to your struggles ive had depression my whole life so ive had a lot of time to think about these things i think it helps to be able to really narrow down what youre feeling i wish you all luck in getting better,pre-pandemic
i know im not as mentally healthy when im tired and i know that im going to be tired the next day if i dont just fing go to sleep and i know it will make everything feel worse but its just a cycle i cant seem to get out of edit thank you so much for the awards and all the time and care everyone has put into their comments while i thought it would be comforting im actually sad to see so many people relate to this im sorry youre all going through this i hope youre able to find peace,post-pandemic

i used to self sabotage and act rather callously i still do somewhat although ive become more mindful when i used to feel depressed i felt like i had a reason like my anxiety or the fact that i drank too much last night or that i was self deprecating all day or because i spokeacted on impulse and suffered the consequences while i still have very bad anxiety my medication has started effectively dampening it ive also started having fewer ideations in general and ive been trying my hardest for the first time in my life to help myself get better i stopped drinking almost completely i sometimes have onemonth when my friends do illicit activities i opt out ive taken away specific triggers ive found a way to hold myself to a flexible eating schedule but im noticing that by doing all of these good things i am starting to feel worse because despite everything i am still depressed i cannot stand in a single place doing nothing without feeling it i cant go to work without feeling it i cant have a day off without feeling it and its causing some of the worst thoughts to start coming back except this time i dont have a crutch and i still dont have any motivation or hope for the future is there anybody here who has gotten better after trying to reroute their life is it possible,post-pandemic

does anyone else find themselves constantly just thinking about dying or disappearing and just not wanting to exist but also not committed enough to end things like i find nearly nothing redeeming about my life i know theres good in it but its just not enough anymore so i just daydream about dying so i dont have to pretend to be okay anymore im not planning to kill myself but i find myself wishing i could because this disinterested floating through life is just pointless,post-pandemic
i dont know how to function in society i can barely go outside without having a panic attack anyone who arent my parents terrify me and i become easily paranoid of things around me ive never been able to get a job at 22 the thought of having to communicate with another being fills me with fear and anxiety i spend almost every day laying in bed sleeping because the only time i can feel happy is in my dreams i hate living like this but im terrified of change and failing i barely even feel like a human being its more like im a ghost drifting through my life my parents try to encourage me to do anything with myself but i wind up doing nothing and rotting away in my room disappointing them even more i hate this shit man none of the medications ive ever been on has helped im just fucked and i dont know what to do i want to kill myself but i dont want my parents to have their child beat them to the grave,post-pandemic
i genuinely hate college with every fiber of my body not only is it absolutely fucking exhausting but i just dont have any motivation to do anything here its so pointless to me first of all ive come to realize that college literally just sets you up to be a corporate slave for the rest of ur life thats not how i wanna live my life no matter how good the pay is idgaf what anybody says on top of that i cant even get an internshipjob offer because everyone at my school is a fucking genius and has like 40000 different work experiencesreferences how in tf am i supposed to compete wtf am i supposed to do bruh im literally sitting in class about to have a mental breakdown my god ive literally been to countless networking events and career fairs and it just doesnt seem to work out for me the whole process of getting an internship having to get professional references and do all this bullshit makes me realize that this corporate bullshit is just not for me whatsoever this shit is genuinely so depressing its unreal i just want to graduate at this point i honestly dont give af about a job offer anymore i gave up on school a long ass time ago if im being real i just want to be happy with my life again,post-pandemic
you know im terrified of death and it was the only thing that kept me from actually doing it im not afraid of pain but im afraid of not feeling like myself which sucks too because drugs would probably help me do what i need to do im so tired of working hard breaking my body only for nothing to improve im 35 with nothing i cant afford my own space and i cant afford the car i drive or the insurance i cant afford my phone bill like everything is just getting harder i had to ask my mother if i could only pay half my part of the mortgage so i can pay my insurance also ive become my mothers punching bag when she is upset with her boyfriend and i am so tired this morning shes telling me to get rid of my cat and dog all i have is my animals and she knows how to use them against me if i have to give them up i think i will do what i can to actually end it i just want this to be over im so so so tired im currently in the process of fixing my teeth because i let it them get really bad my life since 18 is to get up try to remember to shower or my mother would criticize me go to work come home go to sleep and repeat everyday thats literally it i skipped over brushing my teeth or doing anything else meaningless so i can rest now i have to pull out all my teeth using my sisters college money lol because im literally living paycheck to paycheck with a career job im tired,post-pandemic

i just want to turn the clock back 10 years and redo everything and right all the wrongs now i cant too late and too much edit 05242020 i did read all the comments thank you this thought of regrets have tortured me so much a simple choice a decade ago still haunts me today and looms over me in the past two weeks wrestling my inner demons i lost so much weight and have lost so much mental curiosity and interest i used to possess but recently after watching being erica as some of you recommended i realized that no matter where you run you just end up running into yourself i suppose regrets will come in different forms no matter what i do or try the outcome would be the same that id be short of what i desire to be to be honest i dont know what a solution could be here but i suppose seeking it is part of that endless struggle,post-pandemic

well so here goes i am at a total loss so for context i am a 24 year old autistic bisexual demiguy so animation has long been my passion animation and cartoons helped calm me down they helped me understand the world around me now one thing is for sure i was mistreated as a kid teachers did a lot of aba like tactics on me i was yelled at and bullied for my love of cartoons but i was also sensitive i was prone to meltdowns i know i was violently touched and restrained as a kid i was told often to stop talking about movies only getting movie talk or cartoon talk as a reward this girl who i will call shauna for protection her dad was a cop and her uncle was the director of education she would always get away with things she bullied me for liking certain cartoons she would act like my friend and then turn people against me she would spread rumours about me i know we always fought in grade 7 she started physically bullying me i accidentally touched her boob one time in grade 7 and made it out to be serious when it was accidental and i had no idea about the human anatomy at the time she then gaslighted a lot of the school into believing i was a creepy stalker also she was allowed to draw all she wanted but i was yelled at for even doodling then in grade 8 i stood up to her and since her dad was a cop she got a cop to verbally assault me which i still have ptsd from to this day next thing i have a girlfriend who was autistic who also mentally and emotionally abused me she treated me like her slave she got away with behaviours that would get me yelled at by a cop she was obsessed with killing her ex boyfriends she got away with things because her mom ran my citys autism ontario chapter she was also the only autistic who avoided stereotypes because of that too if anyone crossed her her sister or mom would publicly shame them or get them in trouble in smaller ontario towns many neurotypicals tend to dickride whatever autism ontario says like sheep but ignore people who actually have autism not to mention they see many autistics as odsp bums so basically whatever my ex gf and her family said about autism was the law though in reality her mom was only enforcing autism stereotypes like the all autistics are creepy incels or savants like sheldon cooper stereotypes she was the only one treated like an adult while every other autistic was infantilized i was always third wheeling with people as teens i was always awkward and barely invited to parties because they saw me as not mature enough so my childhood bully works in the very job i dreamed of as a child animation my favourite animation studio is sony pictures animation both spider verse films and mitchells vs machines are some of my all time favourite movies sony made many great family films outside spa too now she worked on another show i loved with its newest season hilda i now hate the show because of this she works at mercury filmworks she also worked on kid cosmic as well the school system due to nepotism advanced her drawing skills but stifled mine and she worked on a sony show i am very scared she managed to gaslight a lot of people into believing i am a creepy stalker due to our drama as kids i dont know whether or not i can still be a fan of sony pictures animations moviesshows and still have them as my favourites since mitchells and spider verse and even vivo really helped me her friends too worked on inside job another show i love like i am afraid of making youtube reviews on cartoons because of them potentially finding out and cancelling me i know i am graduating school for broadcast tv but i want to be involved with animation it was my passion she appropriated it from me but i know animation takes a lot of learning and i dont really want to go back to school for animation but i have a lot of stories i want to tell that can only be done in animation is there a way of asking people to animate something for you i am curious i am sick of being stereotyped as a p3do too because i like cartoons and nintendo games this is a common sterotype with autism it sucks if i worked in animation theyd get off my back am actually crying right now i am sick of being told to tough up because i am a guy we have feelings too any advice please i dont know what to do i am at a total loss,post-pandemic
cant go into details too much for privacy sake but im really falling apart my relationship my friendships my happiness all gone all because i acted upon my own anxieties and panicked i wish i had listened to what people told me to do maybe my life wouldnt be all broken i want to cry everyday i want to die everyday everyday is a battle between wanting to be a better man for myself and those around me and wanting to die i dont know how much longer i can take this but i hope im still here for my daughters sake edit this is wild didnt think this would get a lot of attention i posted this as a means of putting it out there instead of bottling it in and im glad a lot of people resonated with this everything sucks but my daughter is the only thing thats keeping me going i hope everyone has that one thing that motivates them to keep going much love,post-pandemic

i turned 21 today i live in one of the biggest college towns in the country when you turn 21 here its a big deal i just finished my third year of college and my third year of having absolutely no friends im not the party type or anything but it still is a bummer not to have a single friend to share the occasion with today i received three texts more than most days one from my mom my dad and my cousin wishing me happy birthday in all fairness i dont have a facebook and i dont expect people to memorize by date of birth or anything but it still feels really sad not to hear back from anyone i guess ive never been comfortable with having a facebook the idea of being so interconnected which each others lives and making daily status updates is such a foreign concept to me but i think in not having a facebook ive sacrificed my social life absolutely anyways ive spent the entire day in my room with the lights off trying to drink away the depression of today and of college there is not a single person who if i called them right now they would pick up and talk to me ive been fighting with my parents and after a few shared unpleasantries are not answering my calls because they want we to cool off and understandably so ive been no contact for ever a year with my girlfriend i knew from highschool who i ended up dating long distance when we started college today i made an attempt to call her went to voicemail to ask her if shed let me take her out to lunch as friends to catch up but i havent heard from her it really breaks my heart that i lost that person who was my best friend for a good part of my life i assumed she would have remembered today was my birthday i certainly didnt forget hers anyways if youve made it this far from the bottom of my heart thanks for listening to me vent edit the reddit community has been absolutely amazing you guys have been sending me happy birthday wishes from all corners of the globe ive been getting offers for people to buy me drinks and some have even given me their cell numbers to talktext me if i was still feeling down you guys are unbelievable you turned what was a miserable day for me into one of the most memorable birthdays ive ever had from the bottom of my heart thank you for all of you who took the time to help a stranger on the internet thank you your words of encouragement have lifted up my spirit exponentially i cant say it enough thank you thank you thank you,pre-pandemic
its because waking up to start a new day is so fucking overwhelming and exhausting in the day time i have to do things and be productive i have to see people and talk to them i have to pretend i care about doing anything and im not thinking of suicide every five minutes nighttime is sort of like this void that is congruent with my state of mind nothing is happening everyone and everything is quiet there are no expectations its like everything is finally over for a little while its just me and my thoughts and an emptiness that is finally acceptable can anyone relate,post-pandemic

i have clinical depression i was diagnosed about 5 years ago it really hits me hard sometimes one of my friends does not understand that people can 100 get depressed because of nothing she thinks people only get depressed for a specific reason such as someone passing away or a horrible break up and those things are awful those feelings are valid and the literal worst but she doesnt understand that people can just be depressed for basically no reason at all im currently having a depressive episode nothings wrong i just cant get out of bed i cant do the dishes i cant pick up the takeout off my bedroom floor i cant i just i cant hear the but why are you depressed question one more time fortunately and unfortunately ive been dealing with this illness for long enough that i know that this feeling will end and i know how to somewhat manage it but if she were to say that to someone else i just worry that it could end someones life anyway thats all im sure no one will even read this k bye edit im really happy this post caused some awesome conversations hopefully made people feel less alone in the fact that you can be depressed about nothing,post-pandemic
ive already hit myself countless times today alone the swelling and bruising makes it even more painful go on vote up,pre-pandemic
yup no shit every time i would ever come out as suicidal thats always the first thing they say the crutch for my existence is reliant on others wanting me to struggle in the same foggy waters that ive been struggling in for years i know theyre trying to help but it doesnt help it just guilts me into a corner and leaves me being perpetually sad all the time it leaves me with the impression that if i sever ties with everyone to the point where i am in their eyes irredeemable garbage that maybe ill finally be free from my death causing pain to others at least that was my impression before i realized the hard way that it would only shift the pain from my death to my actions so even if i get lucky and my suicide was clean it will never be painless so for now im trapped there is simply no solution other than think about wanting to die and feeling selfish right after edit i sympathize for the people in this thread whos parents are part of the problem that makes this statement much much worse the people trying to help are effectively assuming that you have the same loving parents and probably tell you things about their parents you would kill to have for one day that sounds like a rusted knife to the chest and im sorry you have to deal with that to people with worthless unsupportiave parents i hope you can get out of that situation as soon as possible and find a support group and i hope the cretins that drive their kids to suicide eventually receive the same torment that they have dished out,post-pandemic
every time i tell someone from my family how i feel in this case i told my older sister that i commissioned an art piece which was 11 usd of me and my yourself to make myself feel better and she responded with this look youre gonna hate me you need to stop manipulateing with that sorry actually im not sorry i think you need to stop be irresponsible with money progress i think comes in an other way and you are going into your i need to waste to feel good and im gonna excuse myself with this i think the art is beautiful but i think its one of you mechanisms that got you like this in the first place what i had told her is exactly what i said in the post,post-pandemic
the title and this story may sound fake new account to hopefully protect my identity but i swear to you it could not be more real for me i wanted to share this i am not doing this for attention but merely to seek help more questions will be asked at the end of my story as the title describes a miracle has occurred given the severity and intent of the crash the paramedics police doctors nurses and my parents all gave me the most puzzled look of their lives when they asked how fast i was going and i replied 200 kmh i have been depressed for 4 years now nothing has been working and my mental health has declined terribly i have been on multiple medications tried behavioural therapy such as cognitive behaviour therapy cbt and even went a course of electroconvulsive therapy ect first my motivation to do anything went down i couldnt eat do school work and most importantly socialize my social circle grew smaller as my depression grew bigger after 4 years of suffering as well as other health conditions such as horrible eyesight 1000 in each eye with astigmatism sleep apnea and anxiety i figured life wasnt going to get any better and i decided to end my life i drove to the mountains where i decided i would find a large hill go full speed down it and either turn into the median or drive off the road ultimately killing myself about 3 hours from my hometown i found the perfect hill the road was steep perfect for gaining speed to ensure a fatal crash without thinking too much i would just talk myself out and not commit i pulled a uturn and drove to the hill which was about 5 minutes after that point they say your life flashes before your eyes mine played back to me for those 5 minutes the most important people and influential moments of my life appeared before my eyes they suddenly disappeared as i approached my chosen hill my foot automatically floored the gas pedal i placed my left foot behind the brake so i wouldnt back out i raced down the hill gaining more and more speed by the time i reached the bottom my car which only has a speedometer for up to 200 kmh i saw the road start to bend and i jerked my wheel into the opposite direction of the turn slamming the front end of the car into the median that was the last thing i remembered before waking up in my car with tapping on the window from bystanders all i could think to myself at that moment was wow i so much of a failure i cant even kill myself a bystander described to the paramedics and police that i hit the median did about 10 spins no flips and then continued to scrape median down the hill for another 250m i got a glimpse of my car before i was taken away in an ambulance it was completely destroyed when i arrived to the hospital i was placed in the trauma room however the doctor was incredibly surprised after seeing me sitting upright with consciousness after a 200 kmh car accident he assessed me and ordered a fullbody ct scan the results came back clean no bleeding no broken

they originally belonged to my grandpa im not a hunter but we used to go out target shooting and i was a pretty good marksman when he died he left me two of his old rifles theyve mostly sat locked in my closet ever since worth a lot of money but unable to let go of them partly out of sentimentality but id come to realize that i also felt compelled to keep them around for more troubling reasons my depression has been lifelong and ive had varying degrees of success fighting it recently things have been okay but ive had a nightmare of a time with intrusive thoughts impulses to do things i dont even want to do would pop in to my head at the worst times and i would fixate on the details of the aftermath until i would bring myself either to tears or to panic what if i just went up there and did it would my wife be better off in the long run would the friends i havent spoken to in years show up this is shit i do not need running through my mind two years ago i was feeling better i was finally getting serious about art and photography again i actually started selling prints and even had a little space in a local gallery for my work then the grey returned and i started seeing less and less worth going out to see then the darkness came back and i became convinced that those things i used to see and enjoy were gone now and nothing good was on the horizon so last week i made a decision packed up the guns all the ammo i had left and drove to the sporting goods store i got 2200 cash for the pair of guns and on the way home i stopped by best buy and bought myself a fujifilm xt3 for just around 2000 later that evening the intrusive thoughts returned as i tried to think about dinner what if i just went up there and then it cut off the pressure was gone went up there and what grabbed the camera ive always wanted and started taking pictures i did i cursed the cold bundled up grabbed my new gear and lost myself in the woods taking pictures of snowflakes and a family of deer that happened to wander though ive been shooting the camera for the last week and i cant put it down i feel something im really fucking good at this and im motivated to do it my worst impulses have been stopped in their tracks and replaced by the desire to improve and surprise myself its always going to be a struggle for me and i know that but i feel free in a way that i never really expected also posted in rgettingoverit if its not allowed to post in two subs let me know and ill delete,pre-pandemic
its hard to explain but its a feeling of not wanting the pain but wanting it at the same time i feel like depression is very comforting even though its not supposed to be can anyone give me ideas on what this is,pre-pandemic
dear all those living with depression i want to start by saying that i am no expert and that all of the information below is purely based on my experience and opinion regardless i hope that this post helps a famous ancient chinese man yeah seems random i know names lao tzu once said if you are depressed you are living in the past if youre anxious you are living in the future if youre content then youre living in the present step 1 realise that the past is the past you cant help what has happened you must try to move on but also in the process of moving on from whatever awful experiences youve had dont worry about the future or youll land right back where you started so thats two part of the quote the next part is living in the present i want you right now to come up with as many things that youre thankful for having in your head right now thinking about what you already have and appreciate havingare privileged with having gets you on your feet but its the first of many steps to finding your happiness x200b step 2 whats your passion everybody has a drive and a passion its what inspires us everyday who we see ourselves as as a result of this you need to have moved on to continue these steps i want you to focus on your drive what gets you up in the morning even though you tell yourself its just gonna be another shit day focus on it and make some goals as stepping stones derived from your passion this is the beginning of your path to happiness strive to accomplish these goals if you dont want to achieve them then theyre not really associated with your passion this is probably the hardest part of the system outside of moving on to immediately pinpoint what we all really want can be really tough even if it takes you a few days of thought to do it youre on track with your passion as your drive and your goals set push to the finish line now this is tricky some days it will be hard guaranteed and eventually that drive may fade as a result of sinking back into old habits so i want you to set aside a little money each week or month and pin down a date on that date i want you to treat yourself a little even if its just grabbing a chocolate thick shake from mcdonalds down the road the feeling of rewarding yourself should just be the sparkkick you need to keep on moving x200b step 3 the infinite step sounds daunting yeah well this step is just well life youre on your way i cant help any more from here the infinite step is purely just adopting healthy practises to help you not to go back to the state you were at the start of these steps tip 1 every night when you go to bed instead of worrying like many others go again through your head everything that you are thankful for take deep breaths between each one x200b tip 2 try not to associate yourself with negative people by this i mean people who bring you down make you feel like you were at the start this might even mean cutting off connection with a friend even just for a little while i dont mean disassociate yourself from others in your position once you complete these steps as a former sufferer of depression you can really make a connection with those who are in similar positions you can empathise more with them than others can and you can help if you choose to bring many people out of the holes that they have dug for themselves x200b tip 3 pass this on to someone else you know is suffering with depression x200b i do not know if this helps at all i can just hope please feel free to ask any questions in comments good luck for all your futures x200b,pre-pandemic

different girl too after a few seconds though i realized she was pretty attractive i guess thats how hookers do it they cant give out their real identity so its like a 5050 if they are going to be hot or not thankfully this one was its awkward as fuck at first at this point im peaking on all the drugs oh yeah i also bought another form of a viagra pill to help me last longer at 711 before this i give her the cash 120fuck the haters for an hour started joking about how i was actually a cop then confessed i was a virgin she was genuinely surprised said i wasnt bad looking cool im not ugly she said i have a big dick too fuck yeah eased me into it eventually leading to sucking my dickwith the condom on at first tho and fucking her in the ass and pussy i dont know how long we fucked but it was a long timeid say over an hour forsure it didnt feel too good fucking her with the condom on so after this i recommended we smoke her weed because i wasnt getting close to busting at all so we did then she took off the condom and blew me as i was peaking holy crap no i didnt fuck her without a condom gross mind you im a virgin so dont get all your a faggot on me fast forward we fuck for a long time she orgasms i orgasmyeah this part was indescribable i lost some of my hearing for a few seconds i bust in her face blah blah cleaned up chilled for about 30 minutes just getting to know each other she seemed to actually like me asked for my and asked if i wanted to hangout a bit before leaving smoked a cig with her we talked about life afterhow she was so alone and wanted a real friend she was beautiful funny down to earth smart but very sad deep downwith a little bit of hope left she was 36 caring and loving a warm loving heart looking for something but no directionshe was lost medicine was her hooking up with guys for money she couldnt get out her situation but she wanted to i could hear it in her voiceshe is a beautiful human being with a beautiful heart and it breaks me to see her like that i tried to help her but idkbest of luck to you briana hugged each otheri know weird right then she asked if i wanted to hangout another time and was willing to drive to my city holy fuck i know this isnt a big deal and shes a hooker and all yes she might have aids or whatever the fuck but i swear she wasnt ratchet at all plus i practice game so this was eyeopening for me learned that im actually funnywell to myself i am but isnt that the point to conclude it was worth it im gonna get a lot of people looking down on me for doing this but i got a lot more positive out of this than negative1 week later i have stdslol anyways it was worth it especially if you were a sadless insane virgin fuck like me now i am a man with purpose or however that saying goes btw to all the people against hookers its the same for a popular girl at school fucks just as many guys and gets called a slut yet people would still fuck that hot popular girl what do u think a hooker is 3216 update i started developing feelings for hertried to help her sent her a huge text after encountering other hookers i realized she was very specialshe was actually a genuine personbeautiful human beingpersonality and she still had a chance of getting out of the hole she didnt reply i realize cause its patronizing and im 19 shes 36 but i feel better now no signs of stds u have a higher chance of getting an std with a random girl than with a hooker because they have to get checked weekly holy shit update she just texted me back and said i feel like i need to see u says shes sad shes not with me update 3416 the first girl i didnt fully realize how much she was suffering because she was good at hiding it but i knew something was wrong the other two girls were dirtier and worse and they didnt even try to hide that they were sad it was already too late they were gone if i tried to help them they would have laughed at me and told me to get out i mean yeah i could have tried but the main point is that i got a reference between the first girl and the other two and i saw where she was heading so i had to help her in regards to what i did ever since then i contacted a bunch of websites to help against prostitution one being called cash community against sexual harm and talked to one of the employees who was a survivor and got her number i texted my girl a huge text message in hoping to get her to call that number but she didnt reply i just hope she calls that number and turns her life around wow i changed alot reading my first paragraph is disgusting,pre-pandemic
i recently decided to catalogue my struggles with depression through abstract passages while i dont think im very good i decided to post one of them here in case anyone can identify with them and to show some of my feelings through these hard times the darkness darkness is comforting it creeps up on you like mold taking over a tree in the woods it holds your head against your pillow and smothers you with soft whispers of the despair and banality of the light it digs into your soul with gentle yet violent strokes that maybe waking up today was the mistake it clouds your vision like the drop of blood in serene waters imperceptible at first melancholy dripping its sweet nectar into your very essence its the cold grasping embrace that paws at you with the sweet whispers of nothingness when existence becomes an unbearable state of being many people abhor the darkness struggling to thaw its eternal grip on the essence of mortality i welcome it as an old friend the sole companion the void of life has bestowed upon me,post-pandemic
i had a dream where a met a great girl and we had an amazing time but later the dream kinda started to break down and i realized i was dreaming i was so sad that id have to leave her while i was fading out of the dream she just held me and comforted me ive never felt so cared for and wasnt even fucking real i feel fucking pathetic,pre-pandemic
as the months keeps passing by im losing more and more of my myself some days i dont even recognise myself because of how different i am from the joyful girl years ago i miss her i miss being so free and happy she would be so disappointed in present me i dont know how i even reached this point i dont see the point in doing anything good anymore because i dont see myself living longer i have this really important university entrance exam coming up but i havent even studied for it because i just dont see the point anymore ive lost all my ambition and have no clue what to choose as a career i dont want to waste my parents money when ill probably just end up dropping out of uni tbh theyre the only reason why im still here but idk how much longer thats gonna last im just so tired i hate myself and i hate everything,post-pandemic

so i am a pretty horrible person especially lately my relationship with my boyfriend is basically dead mostly for me i think he still loves me we havent had sex for a year or so and none of us have made any effort to fix this i thought my reason for not wanting sex was because it hurts for me im depressed duh and maybe because of the medications im taking then i met a guy we had sex a couple of times when i was drunk as fuck basically blacked out i figured it was just a rough spot it didnt mean anything it hurt etcetc this weekend we were sober he figured my pain was related to stress knots in my vagina and proceeded to massage them out the sex was amazing and i feel like i actually want sex again im not in love with him or anything i just want sex it feels weird as fuck as you can guess i havent told my bf about this i wont tell him for a little while either because im unemployed and cant afford to move which i will have to when we break up every day i pretend everything is fine tell him i love him etc and i do this just because of self preservation not because i dont want to hurt him and its not like i love you but as a friend its more you feel more like an aquaintance to me and i dont respect you ive cheated in relationships before but then ive used it as a means to end the relationship for good because i didnt trust myself to manage to break up properly now i just dont feel anything about it i dont feel horrible about it its just nothing of course i feel bad for my boyfriend who trusts me but its more like how one reacts when hearing about other people being cheated on it doesnt feel like this is someone ive fallen out of love with its more like hes a stranger i dont really care about he hasnt done anything to deserve this hes a really nice guy i just feel myself becoming more and more detached from everything im not in love with the other guy i just want sex mostly because ive never had painless sex and didnt know it could be this good thats all i currently care about i am a narcissistic bitch and i dont really want to be like that but i just dont care enough to do anything about it breaking up feels more like a hassle than anything else of course i should have broken up with him months ago or at least after the first time i had sex with the other guy i know how hell feel when i tell him everything ive been cheated on before its devastating knowing the one you love and trust have done these things behind your back and lied to you i just dont care i dont like not being able to care about it i want to change and i dont know how treating people like this and not feeling anything about it is so wrong to me and i dont want to be like this im trying to live with my depression as best as i can i take medications and try not to worry about everything being more content with myself this feeling of not caring about something like this is so wrong i dont want it to last tldr dead relationship fucked a guy will probably do it again havent told bf dont care just trying to get a job so i can move has this happened to anyone else here was it just a phase how did you change if you managed to,pre-pandemic

i said it a lot of times people want to tell others who are suicidal that theres always another way or that itll get better and while that might be true for some for many its not theres not always a silver lining to ones painful existence and things dont happen for a reason sometimes people are just thrown into holes so deep that nothing could get them out and there is realistically no chance of them having a good life i wish it werent true and that there was some level care from the universe to the ones who find themselves in these predicaments but honestly the universe couldnt give less of a shit contrary to what people may say the world is not a beautiful place the world is only beautiful for those who are privileged enough or work their asses off to be in that position,post-pandemic

i feel as if im just wasting his time by even saying anything to him neither of us are really out no one but the few friends i vent about this to know about us and ive been up countless countless nights wondering if he would even notice if i would just disappear its almost like he enjoys it or is just totally and completely unaware of it which im sure isnt the case i just cant go without eating for as long as i have been again ive dropped a solid 2030 pounds stressing about this i cant fall asleep before 530600 as im sitting now is the first time in a long time ive actually sent him real concise messages telling him how i feel like garbage and that whether hes aware or not its how he treats me and i get nothing in response i just dont know what to do anymore,pre-pandemic

my uncle asked me to take him a couple places today and i told him no i cant take you right now he knocked on my door at around 6 in the morning to ask me to take him out 6 in the morning im fucking half naked inching the door open while this man asks me at 6 in the morning if i can take him out to a couple places today i said no im in the middle of finals i know a couple places means 5 places that ill spend an hour each in i said no and he said alright i thought that was the end of it i get back in bed an hour later hes slamming shit in the kitchen slamming doors closed downstairs till finally he comes up to me again pounding on the door asking me to take him somewhere i said no and he started fucking screaming over the word no he eventually said nevermind and a second later hes walking out the door slamming the door on his way out over the word no but when i tell my parents this im the wrong one for getting him upset and not succumbing to what he wants my dad asked me the other day if i still had my depression what the fuck does he think edit thank you for all the solidarity i oftentimes feel like im an asshole and run myself into circles wondering what i did wrong in each and every moment how i could have prevented a negative confrontation from my family by simply being agreeable with them i struggle with this and the friends i have dont always fully understand where im coming from all of the time so its nice seeing that im not insane over denying someone else i managed to get a go ahead from a friend to stay at his place for the weekend to cool off because im starting to spiral and am quickly heading to a place i dont want to be thanks again for taking the time to actually listen to what im saying,post-pandemic

i slept at 2am yesterdaytoday and i woke up at 7am i would have liked to stay unconscious a little longer but my body didnt allow it i want to cry i forced myself to sleep at 2 because i was wide awake i cant sleep i never i hate myself i cant do this anymore its so hard waking up and seeing that my house looks like a hoarders house and that all my assignments are piling up and all the accomplishments of my peers towering over me im good at nothing and have done nothing ive tried journaling mediation maybe i havent tried hard enough i tried therapy but it never works i hate myself theres something wrong with me i dont have any friends either i tell you when i say no friends i really mean it i have zero friends im all alone at school i feel so isolated,post-pandemic
this statement makes no sense to someone who doesnt suffer from depression i wish i was never born i wish that this would all end but i cant bring my self to end it i want to not exist but for some reason dying scares me not death whatever lies beyond i will deal with when i get there but its the step between suffering and non existence that scares me,post-pandemic
this quote has always stood out to me as one of the most eloquent and simplest depictions of depression ive ever encountered in literature one of the few times im actually startled by my own reflection just thought id share id love to hear any poignant quotes or excerpts you guys may have too,pre-pandemic
i know that i can talk to friends and family about my feelings but at the same time i just feel like there is no one i can talk to nor do i possess the capacity to voice my feelings aloud whenever i try talking with a friend i just clam up i dont understand myself i dont understand why i am like this why cant i just express how im feeling maybe because expressing feelings aloud makes them real or permanent a perspective voiced gives permenamce to those thoughts im still unsure of anything and everything,post-pandemic
i feel so sorry for the lives lost to covid 19 but i have no sympathy for the people who are apparently killing themselves due to lock down thats pathetic and gives pple with depression a bad name,post-pandemic
nobody faces the same challenges when battling depression some have it harder than others while some goes through an equally difficult period but with different elements to why it is difficult i have found a phrase that helps me through the day through those dark periods when all i can do is to feel sorry for myself this phrase is the world doesnt owe you anything most of us knows that in the animal kingdom every animal goes through a brutal life dominated by chance and luck the world doesnt owe a lion a long life just as it doesnt owe a gazelle a long life most of us understand this but fail to apply this logic to our own life the world doesnt owe us anything we are not entitled to love from family or friends we are not entitled to the bed we sleep in these are blessings and shouldnt be taken for granted a recent example from my own life that send my spiraling down into a depressed phase i was at a party and as usual i was anxious about not being funny or interesting so i get uptight and nervous this is normal for me so i expect this to happen what i feared was gonna happen though happened i was chatting to a buddy and a drunk girl comes over i get uncomfortable and dont make much of myself another one comes over to the three of us and says whats up the drunk girl comments how my buddy is playing serious and that im actually 100 serious and that she is trying to think of fun things to say becausse were so boring yes that was an incredibly rude thing to do yes you shouldnt care what other people say but thats not how we really work so the comment from this girl triggers bad memories from all the time ive been called boring serious and uninteresting and there are a lot of those ill tell ya this statement put me in a bad state so i didnt enjoy the rest of the night what i shouldve done was to think im not entitled to feel funny and interesting i shouldnt feel like a victim because this girl or others dont enjoy my company im not entitled to that the universe doesnt work that way why should i feel sorry for myself feel bad feel worthless just because an interaction didnt go the way i wanted it to no i perhaps others should stop feeling sorry for themselves were not entitled to anything we gotta be grateful for every positive moments we have because theres no reason that we deserve or are entitled to those feeling that the world owes us makes it easier for us to feel like victims to feel sad to feel sorry for ourselves so this was a rally to all those who easily feel sorry for themselves like i do try to shift your perspective a tad and i hope that will help you hope this didnt offend anyone depression is as i said different from person to person and i shouldnt tell you how to feel or deal with that experience i also know that being called boring is a miniscule problem compared to people who are victims of molestation or other much more seriously damaging experiences than going to a bad party like i did this weekend much love,pre-pandemic
a month ago i tried to get my ex gf back since i still love her more than ever she told me shes happy with someone else now were no more in contact cant stop thinking about her never mind what it is because i realised shes everything i need the ones in a lifetime girl now i can just hope hes cheating on her and time soon or dies or some shit so i get my last chance additional to that im looking for a job for over 2 years now and still nothing in sight additional to that my familys home is packed with bills and if we cant manage to pay anymore well land on the street im at the deepest point in the history of my 20 12 years and i simply cant see anything that would make it better,pre-pandemic

just a warning in case anyone else has been dealing with suicidal ideation please just ignore my post cause i dont want to trigger anyone well where do i begin its been a pretty rough start to the new year at least from a personal level i have never really been a positive or happy person despite what my parents continue to reiterate to me i am pessimistic and for the most part i have gotten use to my outlook on life but even for me it is getting tiring how can i muster up the energy to go outside if all i feel is glaring and judging eyes looking at me how can i go outside and pursue a career when the first thought of putting myself out there is negative judgment i recently graduated from university and for me a person who experienced so much anxiety it was a miracle but now i dont see a step forward what do i do next without the structure of classes i am lost and because of my fear of judgement i just cant muster up the energy to apply for anything i am qualified for i tell my parents and instead of helpful advice i just keep getting bombarded with negative words lecturing me on why i should have a job already why i should have a relationship or why i should be like all the other normal people they see around them doesnt help that my neurodivergence was not detected until i was already an adult and that my neurotypical younger brother is finding life easy and i know that it is easy to say that as an outsider that my golden brother may not find life easy but i know he does today was just another day of me being told what i should be doing how i should be doing things and that i am wasting my life leading me to feel alone and worthless it would be so easy to just cut my arm like i normally do but make it deeper wrap my throat and feel the pressure before darkness takes over but then i feel bitter about what my death would invertible cause my parents lying about who i was a person they never spent time getting to know playing mourning figures when they could never care about me whenwhile i am alive the less than a handful of friends who showed me love remembering the good times but also the bad many of which may never find out about my death because i have such a separation between family and those who i care about the only thing keeping me from ending it all is that fear of being remembered incorrectly being thought of in ways that are fabrications from a parents vanity even now while writing this i am sitting next to a blade knowing full well that one day my self control will be gone and with it so will my life,post-pandemic
so i guess my depression has started getting worse because last night i actually found myself in tears over which is the first time to ever happen to me but something that we all eventually progress to when it gets pretty bad anyways as i was standing there hunched over the bathroom sink tears in my eyes face red faced and burning i decided to call upon a higher power now i attend church on a regular basis and am very blessed good job health family ect ect so i am very ashamed of the fact that alot of times i feel like complete crap for no reason at all when my life is pretty good however i just simply said a quick prayer begging god for a little help in the currect situation for that i just cant do it alone almost right away i started feeling calm and by the end of the night i was feeling ok and that has carried on into today maybe it can help a few of you it wouldnt hurt to try for those who dont believe troll away if you feel the need i could care less,pre-pandemic

i feel like my depression takes away my brains ability to simply ignore all the countless problems in the world the poverty hunger abuse war corruption all of which could be significantly reduced if humanity wasnt so selfish hurtful weak and idiotic the pointless grind of working terrible jobs just to survive the futility of going after your dreams because none of them are likely to become a reality the inevitability of pain and death for you and everyone around you where the best case scenario is that you die quickly and are the first one to do so life is just a nonstop horror show depression doesnt make it seem like it life actually is terrible depression just makes it impossible to ignore,post-pandemic
for the last 2 years i felt this way in a few days its gonna be 2 years since my girlfriend left me and it being valentines day today doesnt help i was dumb and looked at her socials to see she has a new boyfriend and i all i can think is there gonna have a good valentines day together and its just get sad seeing everyone walking with flowers to give to the loved ones it just makes me so depressed my rooms never been this messy before i dont have motivation to go to the gym i recently went on a trip and the only thing i can think about is her i think about her everyday and i think i have a problem but i dont know who to talk to it about my counselor at the time was getting sick of me and just started ignoring my messages i have no one i feel comfortable with to talk about so that brings me to this reddit post is there any way i can get free therapy sorry for the post if it seems rushed i dont what else to say with out going into details thanks in advance,post-pandemic
i dont know what it is that im missing about life in general i think i make pretty reasonable choices as far as how i live my life but good things just dont happen to me yes no one life is perfect but other people actually have meaningful relationships in their life they have sex sometimes sometimes other people want to spend time with them because they like them not me every decision i make just leaves me in the same sad empty place all by myself i dont know what it is exactly but im not sure i even care anymore if i had to guess id say im just a fundamentally unlikable and unattractive person and i dont mean ugly i dont really think i am ugly i mean i am unattractive and unlikable as a human being ive been fighting tooth and nail against this mindset for years all the while genuinely trying to get the kinds of relationships i want if you wanna tell me i havent been reallllllllly trying and have been secretly self sabotaging all these years you can just suck my ass i have been tried shit just does not ever work out its them and its me they dont like me easy as that i should kill myself,post-pandemic
we all admit that our humain brain is a complicated organ so the idea here is understanding what depression is im not going to explain it scientifically you can read about it or just watch some youtube videos to understand how things work im here to make it clear for those whos sharing some supportive paragraphs thinking they help ok thanks for the efforts but its not how things work i mean depression cant be that shallow mental illness that can disappear that easily by reading posts on the internet depression is a mental complexe if that makes sense that seems like a digital virus in fact it has its unique algorithms that are complicated so that your antivirus and by that i mean your optimism can not defend you so depression is really a smart virus it attacks your security so that you have nothing to do against it or maybe you have but its not that helpful so my point is if your own system wasnt able to defeat its own self it means one thing some supportive posts wont please do not read between the lines im not trying to make it more difficult for those who suffer from depression im making it clear,post-pandemic
nothing more is left for me its hopeless,post-pandemic
i spent the last hour or two just switching between youtube reddit and some other websites spending no more than a couple of minutes on each i couldnt barely finish a single video on youtube and id just keep refreshing the home screen for a bit then checking reddit then some other forums then the game im afk in then repeat again its too much effort for me to even finish a video from start to finish let alone listening to music or even playing the game im afk in anyone else just feel like doing nothing feel like not wanting to live when you are depressed edit thank you for the reddit gold even though its my first time getting it i dont feel as appreciative as i should be considering the state that my mind is in sorry,pre-pandemic
mine started while on trazodone,post-pandemic
as a part of my mental illness i suffer from strong self doubts and feelings of being worthless and i often got told that if i have these i need to think very positively about myself and realise that these thoughts arent true but it never worked my negativity is way too strong to be able to habe any positive thoughts about myself let alone to have stronger positive than negative thoughts so my current therapist suggested another approach she said instead of forcing myself to think positive i should try to not evaluate myself at all for a certrain time neither negatively nor positively though the second is rather rare anyway what this does is that it gives some distance to the negative thoughts and therefore breaks that cycle of depression where depression makes me have negative thoughts and the negative thoughts make me depressed this is way easier because i just have to be neutral instead of positive and i notice what she means with breaking the cycle i hope that this might help someone here edit i dont know what to say right now last time i looked at my phone this had 10 upvoted and i was so happy that 10 people considered this useful and now i see this thank you so much this means the world to me,post-pandemic
lost afraid ashamed unworthy outcasted exhausted cold dead i come home once a determined boy now a drifting shadow of man i come home away from all mine and myself stepping up on each sunrise tripping falling spraining in pain i walk back each sunrise shows a glimpse of a summit the ground slippery mocks me i creep and crawl and slip to the same spot only more battered and drained each time my presence reeks i detest my reflection in the lake for who am i im not someone ever destined for the ascent my hopes and dreams a cruel jest upon my existence seems like the chill of winter can only grow colder,post-pandemic
hi all for as long as i can remember ive always had random overwhelming waves of wanting to cry there doesnt seem to have to be a reason but it also can be triggered by things that have no place making me feel like that it could be happy things or mundane things causing it when i say they are overwhelming i mean i feel it in my whole body over the years ive gotten good at suppressing them when they appear but i also have to reallyy concentrate on stopping it i cant remember the last time i let it happen without stopping it i dont mean i dont cry in normal situations just not allowing those specific waves take over my emotions so i dont really remember what happens if i do i think i would just cry and it will eventually stop im not sure if it has something to do with suppressing my emotions which is something ive had to do growing up but not now that i tend to have a lot more empathy than normal or what but does anyone know what this could be im really getting tired of it happening,post-pandemic
first im sorry if this isnt the place to put this i couldnt find anywhere else that i thought would let me talk about this its really eating me up tonight slow deep breath so the tldr is that im in love with my girlfriend an amazing woman but i also still love my wife ive been with my wife for 7 years now dated for a year engaged for 2 married 4 but sex has always been something i thought could use a little more something plus i didnt get much of it she says its not that she doesnt want to but that shes always so tired after working all day then she says that its because she has to say no so often that its easier to say no than to just have sex we would often go two to three months without any sexual contact two years ago i reconnected with a friend from college we went to a reunion mixer thing and just chatted went to a bar afterwards with some friends and got kinda flirty then texted each other after and within a couple days we were basically sexting a few more days and we had sex for the first time we agreed that it could only be sex and we could meet up as often as needed since we were both in committed relationships already but we could never catch feels or we would have to cut it off we did cut it off twice and one night i got drunk alone and told her how i felt i told her that i wanted whatever it is we had with all the complications attached so we were in a relationship at that point i guess now im really truly in love with this woman and want to be with her all the time but i still love my wife too and my depression makes it worse i dont feel guilt in the typical sense i feel guilty that i dont feel guilty and i feel torn like i should be choosing one but i feel like i need both i feel like i should be ending with a question but i just really want to talk about it,pre-pandemic
i used to come here every day and thank god i stopped most posts on here seem to be about how horrible people feel suicide and hopelessness instead of supportive comments youll get equally depressed people agreeing with the op or talking about their own misery i initially thought this sub was supposed to help depressed people but it honestly makes me feel so much worse,pre-pandemic
turns out she loves me but isnt in love with me and has felt that way for a couple months but couldnt figure out what was bugging her until recently so today she finally put words to the feelings and told me i had kinda felt like something was off but i thought it was other events that had caused it turns out im just not the kind of person she can love my words of course not hers added to my getting laid off our emergency fund running low and generally not good times across the board im just done i think im going to go drive somewhere and sleep in my car part of me thinks a garage with the engine running sounds like a nice place for a nap,pre-pandemic

i became disabled about two and half to three years ago ive pretty much always lived in poverty and thats what its gotten me i got with a girl when i was in my early 20s and got her pregnant i tried my best with things i rushed to buy a house that i really couldnt afford for her and that was a huge mistake not only did she end up just disappearing forever and leaving me with the kid and the house but the house she wanted ended up being a disaster it had many problems but the worst one has been the new roof which was installed incorrectly ive been here 12 years now and its leaked for most of those years despite multiple attempts to have it fixed a few years ago i thought i finally had the problem solved some guys came out and repaired it and all was good six months or so passed and it wasnt leaking anymore so i dumped a huge amount of money into remodeling the room the leak had been in since i had just graduated college and gotten a shiny new job big mistake again shortly after i finished the remodel the leak came back same place it was before nobody i called could take responsibility and wed been having some heavy rains i was scared of all the money and work i put into it being literally washed away so i stupidly climbed on the roof with a tarp and thought id just lay some plastic down over it and hopefully at least prevent further damage until i could afford to have someone come back again to fix it again i fell rolled down the roof and off the side of the house and ruined my life forever i destroyed my back and have nerve damage in my shoulder i guess im lucky i survived or at least thats what people tell me i can barely walk unassisted i have trouble lifting my right arm and im in constant pain obviously i havent been able to work since then i tried for a while but the pain was too much the lack of mobility made everything so much harder and my hand shakes too much to do the intricate electronics work that i went to college for so two years ago i applied for social security disability and i was denied i appealed and was denied again i requested a judge look at my case last september and two days ago she denied my appeal as well in spite of her own vocational specialist testifying during the hearing that i couldnt work based on my condition in these past two years with no income i lost my car that i stupidly bought when i got the shiny new job and ive sold almost all of my possessions just to keep the lights on i havent paid my mortgage in well over a year because i just have not had the income and as a result im in foreclosure on this shitty home thats been the source of all my pain and suffering you would think i wouldnt be too heartbroken about losing the house considering all the issues that have come of it but its still my home i bled for this home i ruined my life for this home its the only home my now 13 yo son has ever known and on the 27th of february its being auctioned off and ill lose the last material possession i have i dont really know where were going to go from here my parents would take us in and thats good for my son but my parents are controlling overbearing spiteful and i think i hate them im 34 years old and they still try to micromanage my life even though i havent lived with them in 12 years i dont know if ill survive living under their roof again all i do know is that ive lost almost everything im miserable and i hate my life i hate the world and ive become so angry and bitter over my situation that ive even begun hating everyone around me im even beginning to resent my son because deep down he just reminds me of that one stupid mistake i made almost 14 years ago that lead me to all of this and because despite that i still feel the responsibility of a parent towards him hes the only reason im still alive honestly i would have killed myself by now if it wasnt for the guilt and fear of what that would do to him im just stuck in this miserable existence where my life is devoid of all happiness and every waking moment is filled with pain both physical and emotional and im tired so very tired i wish it would end,post-pandemic

hey so i have been struggling with depression for at least 10 years now i had a very hard time years back when i was taking medication and tried therapy it kinda ended when i came together with my now ex we were together for 7 years and i ended it last november just was not working out anymore i struggle a lot again lately obviously due to the breakup as well some things about me i try to maintain a few friends in my life i am really shy self esteem is basically non existent whatever i try to achieve i always think i will fail in the back of my head to feel at least a bit comfortable in groups of people i would have to drink alcohol the only time i am in groups of people would be the weekend i dont drink on weekdays on the other hand the alcohol makes me feel mentally even worse on the next day after a night out if i have the time i will just lay in darkness in my bed for 2 days barely eating or doing anything i am basically feeling like i am barely keeping my head over the water most of the times of course there are rare occasions where i feel better but 90 of the time i just dont enjoy life i would say i am a very sensitive person and every little inconvenience just totally knocks me off my feet and i cant deal with life very efficiently i just dont know what i am doing all this for why do i have to do this whats the point i just have nothing to look forward to and feel like a useless piece of shit i dont get how other people can just be happy in life with this being said suicidal thoughts are there as well every now and then it just feels calming knowing to have the option to end it i have not tried anything yet tho this didnt all start with the breakup it just got worse i am currently trying to finish my bachelors degree and it is just super hard for me to focus on anything related to it i also started going to the gym on a regular basis which i really enjoy i already talked to my doctor about my mental state lately and she said i dont lack any nutrients or anything which would benefit my bad mental state so do you guys have any ideas what could help me maybe you have been in a similar situation and broke out of it of course the most reasonable next step would probably be to get therapy i will try to do that but it takes a very long time where i live sorry for the long post feel free to ask me anything,post-pandemic

you know how many people reject me and judge me for my mental illnesstrauma guys will fucking play me act all into me at first and then flip the script and be like oh srry this aint gonna work out u dont rlly love me ur just miserable haha bye they dont say that literally but im trying to summarize lol like wtf you knew about my trauma and mental illness from day one why even entertain the idea of wanting me if you were just gonna reject me for things outside of my control anyways do you know how devastating and invalidating that is thats like saying someone with a disability cant love someone because theyre not normal tbh i think the only reason guys do this is because they see girls like me as easy targets since im mental and ive been abused my entire life they think they can just walk all over me and are surprised when i stand up for myself and dont allow them to do that well screw you and fuck off,post-pandemic

i 27f have depression and anxiety never been diagnosed but i absolutely know that i do i grew up with my mom suffering from depression and anxiety right in front of me she has tried so many different kinds of medications therapies group therapies moving and starting a new life many relationships etc she has done it all and ive watched her as my dad is not in the picture none of that lead anywhere i ever want to be she also cant work because of a bad back she hasnt been in a relationship in years and never will again she lives in a basement apartment paying through welfare absolutely hates herself has intense depression and anxiety is on countless meds and has tried so many shes still depressed and anxious and hates her life she still wants to die all the time and has nothing good in her life her words not mine so what the fuck is the actual point in me even trying to get better when she never did and i have the same genes as her the more i grow into an adult the more i see that im the exact fucking same person as her nothing makes me feel more bleak and hopeless in this world than recognizing that as i grew up i always told myself i never want to be like her and here i am her spitting image she never got better only worse so what hope do i even have im just never going to be someone thats genuinely happy its always going to be fake just enough to get by and keep my boyfriend and friends but nobody will ever know how awful i feel inside 90 of the time some days im happy and i feel like i can do this then next day the depression is even worse i dont want to kill myself but i also dont want to just feel so bad all the time i have so much potential and it will never be used because the unhappiness is so fucking deep and thick in my genes i dont see a light at the end of the tunnel i picture myself growing older and being the exact same unhappy forever just like my mom there better be an afterlife because this is bullshit im a good person i dont deserve this,post-pandemic
its helped my game last saturday at a party i experimented with a friends girlfriend or her lady friends just for that reason whenever i walked around i tried to keep a smile in the eyes so that i look approachable and when i make eye contact with someone im already halfway there to smiling so its not awkward usually she smiles back and if she doesnt she usually looks away which is no big deal its a small victory like this for my confidence i forgot i much i loved making women smile i maybe a 410 or 510 in the looks department for now but im not going to let that get to me,pre-pandemic
when im around my friends i feel like i want to be in their conversation i want to laugh and smile at their jokes and contribute with my own stories but i just cant like i physically couldnt even if i tried i always end up just sitting there looking at them listening and not contributing even though i so desperately want to idk sorry,pre-pandemic
just curious if anyone else affected by this problem also noticed quite a big cognitive decline or if anyone has noticed a cognitive decline and managed to build themselves back up to that previous cognitive level,pre-pandemic
i used to be so outgoing and carefree i was content with myself because i didnt really have the capacity at that point to dislike myself at all like i didnt really know what that was and i hadnt really lived much of life at that point to have developed anxiety and other issues i didnt overanalyse and overthink i actually used to walk about without this constant pit feeling in my stomach and without anxiety filling up my chest all the time i genuinely used to be fine and now im not so much if i sit for a while and actually genuinely think about how i physically and emotionally felt and think about my past perception of the world it is so different from how i feel now and occasionally ill get a fleeting feeling that reminds me of the contentedness i had when i was younger but it never stays and it makes me so sad edit holy upvotes thanks for the awards and also sharing your feelings with me its nice to know people are experiencing the same thing,post-pandemic
a good friend of mine with whom ive been attending therapy for bpd overdosed a couple days ago she survived and was transported unconscious to the hospital she woke up but is unsurprisingly devastated i want to be there as her support she has a boyfriend but no family members who care about her and few friends i had plans to see my family for christmas but when this happened it left me deeply depressed particularly because another good friend of mine had committed suicide four years ago almost on the same day to elaborate i dont like spending christmas with my family i like them but christmas has always been more about chores and preparations than about quiet and peace i thought i would spend christmas by visiting my friend in the hospital i dont want her to be alone i know that if i were in her situation i would appreciate it if someone came to visit me so i proposed this to my mother and brother even the possibility that i would spend the afternoon with her and then go down to see them before dinner however their comments left gasping for air they showed little empathy for my friend or me my mother asked me if i had any normal friends my brother told me that while its ultimately my choice i would be ruining christmas by not coming down or even by coming down just for dinner that everyone would be disappointed in me and it would create arguments implying i would be at fault for them heres the breakdown with my family i risk being ostracized for weeks if not months if i dont go down there however ive felt more and more like they were less and less my family while ive felt like my friends have shown more compassion and empathy for my depression and bpd than my family ever has in fact theyve dismissed it as me not having enough social activity as not having enough will and have called my therapy a waste of time i feel like visiting my friend is the right thing to do i know i will think of her the whole time i would be down at my familys but i do not want to be ostrasized for months i dont think i could handle it with my mental condition any and all thoughts are welcome thank you,pre-pandemic

just look at myself a man with ugly disgusting hair fat on my stomach even after losing weight and the worst of all a penis the most despicable and worthless thing to ever have been brought upon this earth its so disgusting that millions of womens lives are ruined because of this gross thing between my legs just turn on the news open up a depression thread read the statistics see the despair and im not just talking about rape even most consensual sex is looked back upon with great regret we grind grind grind away at work at exercise at building a character in a desperate attempt to draw attention away from the true disgusting and desperate intentions but only the very best can achieve deception for the rest of us we get offended when the deception fails at least thats the bleak depiction that i keep coming back to i really wish there was more to life but when youre treated like this and the news social media and all personal relations all play out in the same way its really hard to see things differently i guess i just have to accept that men are disgusting and thats why they should be isolated as what has been happening more and more often lately,pre-pandemic

i 15f am miserable i have been for maybe 3 years now my depression only getting worse as time moves on i have not been diagnosed with anything other than add when i was very very young but i have leading suspicions for some sort of clinical depression anxiety or some sort of bpd i live with my mom my moms boyfriend my grandma and my baby brother my brother is a bit of a meanie but means well even so i often project anger and resentment against him and my mom they annoy me beyond my own comprehension and i hate that i am never not irritated with my living situation my mom is always throwing a lecture at me that i never seem to remember any part of and cannot make myself pay any attention to she is always nagging about something and i hoped to never end up as miserable as her but i fear im actually far more theyre good to me and love me but i cannot take it i want to move out as soon as i can but im even scared to do that ive been in a pretty healthy relationship with a boy 15m but its been pretty distant we dont have much in common and i dont think i was ever mentally prepared to be with someone since i can barely take my normal situation just alone ive considered breaking up with him every other day because i am getting quite little out of this relationship and he probably deserves better i am failing at least 2 classes at all times i used to blame teachers and i was right bit now i blame myself i cannot make myself do any homework when i get home i feel like doing nothing my interests no longer entertain me my hobbies are sat aside all day for me to rot in my bed while doomscrolling instagram or tiktok or reddit i have no actual coping mechanisms that help me long term i cry andor masturbate nightly just to shake off overwhelm or sadness and either way i go to sleep feeling guilty about something i cannot put my finger on i used to often break down at school or in public i still do but i find a corner or a bathroom to do this in i used to find a big joy in mornings of dressing up really colorfully and cute everyday but as i get more and more tired a pair of jeans or slacks and a hoodie is the go to i barely even brush my hair anymore its been stuck in a puffy pony for about a week with the occasional removing the band and putting it back in to refresh my hair i hate my looks and my body and i go back and forth between denial and acceptance of it i weigh 240 pounds and i am 510 i have no patience or time for eating well or exercising i miss and envy who i was before 2020 i was a gifted academic student and never had any mental emotional or physical issues i hadnt much thunk about life afterwards im weighed down by literally everything now and i feel like im in the worst state to take on this challenge im black im queer im a woman im not very attractive i talk a lot i grew up sheltered and have trouble making good friends i have no balls and no grip on anything i am an atheist by logic not by choice and i used to be a christian not bring a christian i think ruined my joy part of why i no longer believe is because when my doom and depression started i asked god to give me strength and i got nothing i was maybe 8 at the time i waited and waited and i still havent got that strength it just seems as if he didnt hear me with the war that i see everyday in palestine and the congo with my american government getting worse with my extreme agraphobia with knowing that the only way ill ever be able to get enough money to sustain myself is to get at least a bachelors innan actual degree that i probably wont like with knowing that i still have at least 6 years of school ahead of me with knowing that the friends i have now are probably not going to last with inflation being so bad i may have to work two jobs in the future with knowing that i have no actual purpose and everything that makes me happy is material or superficial or absurd i feel a resentment and hatred towards waking up everyday and simply just living i dont consider myself suicidal but i definitely do not wanna be here and i have considered it i do not believe in a god so i dont fear any concerns or consequences to doing so life is very meaningless to me at this point and i want my old life back id kill for it to be 2018 again why do i feel a sense of impending doom i cannot shake what should i do,post-pandemic

if you wish to understand the universe think of energy frequency and vibration nikola tesla the great mind of nikola tesla was referring to what we in the modernday know as quantum physics what is quantum physics quantum physics is the science dealing with the behavior of matter and lightenergy on the atomic and subatomic scale its the study of consciousness energy frequency vibration to understand consciousness is to understand reality itself everything in life is energy all matter is made of energy everything from the ground you walk on the bed you sleep in the water you drink to the air you breathe is just energy anything solid liquid gas or plasma is a basic unit of matter all matter is made up of atomsatoms contain subatomic particles protons neutrons electrons and quanta these particles are the smallest particles measurablethousands of times smaller than a period at the end of a sentence quantum physics has shown that although matter may appear to be solid when you look at it through a highpowered microscope so that it is broken down into its smallest components the protons electrons neutrons are ultimately composed of 999999999 of empty space filled with energy these subatomic particles protons electrons neutrons are moving and emitting wavelengths of electrical energy these waves of electrical energy are what we call a frequency everything you can see smell taste touch hear and think holds a specific frequency a wave that vibrates at different speeds its in constant motion always moving nothing is at rest everything in reality is in motion all matter vibrates in essence everything is composed of energy and filled with empty space but vibratesmovement at a frequency a table or phone or tv may seem like its not moving but in reality its vibrating its protons electrons neutrons are constantly moving vibrating emitting waves at a specific frequency making it appear physical giving its texture color smell taste and sound everything that appears solid is just the vibrational frequency of energy that makes it up the energy is just condensed making it appear physical so if everything is just energy filled with empty space what is reality exactly the principles of quantum mechanics explain that the universe is a quantum field a limitless void of matter and energy the field of infinite possibilities a mind one consciousness one energy at a different rate of vibration and frequency expressing itself through life the quantum field is the underlying essence of all matter and energy the building blocks of reality the quantum field is the source of power for all quantumpowered beings whats a quantum powered being any living organism with a brain the brain is the receiver of consciousness it renders energy frequency vibration its a quantum computer a network of up to 100 billion neurons working together to create and interpret and simulate your reality our consciousness is the way we observe our world everything you see hear touch taste smell think and feel holds a specific vibrational frequency everything in reality is just frequencies electrical signals received by the nervous system for the brain to process instantly creating your experience life is your own personal quantum field the existence of this quantum field acts according to quantum principles and it does and does not exist meaning a quantum field does not exist until a quantum being willed it to do so matter doesnt exist unless its being observed without an observer atoms are just waves particles with an infinite possibility the quantum field can not exist without being observed without your sensesyour ability to perceive life cant exist the way we observe the quantum field decides what we see the observer is the observationin other words our mind is not simply our perception of experiences but those experiences themselveseverything in life is youthe relationships youre inthe good and bad events you experience and the environments youre in are all a reflection of you a reflection of your mind a reflection of your thoughts all is mental your experiences create different neural connections to bring about different perceptions thoughts beliefs systems and emotions to createregulate your own vibrational frequencyyes you are energy we each have our very own electromagnetic field that vibrates at a specific frequency and your vibration will set up resonance with whatever possesses identical frequency the reality you experience is a reflection of your vibration like attracts like reality is a mirror thought is where it all begins the thoughts feelings and actions we choose have their own rates of vibrationnegative thoughts and feelings hold a low frequency and lower your vibration while positive thoughts and feelings hold a high frequency increasing your vibration as your conscious mind dwells habitually on thoughts and feelings of a certain quality these become firmly embedded within the subconscious mind the way the subconscious mind is programmed becomes the dominant vibration your programming is analogous to your vibration the dominant vibration sets up a resonance with other similar vibrations and draws them into your life positive feelings positive circumstances negative feelings negative circumstances so not only do your thoughts and feelings affect your vibration so does the environment your environment withholds a vibration human beings are tropical species we belong in natural environments citys hold a low vibration cell phone towers radars satellites radiation toxic chemicals and pollution affect the human electromagnetic field city life may have its benefits but its been associated with higher rates of mental illness it lowers our vibration and keeps energy stagnant the vibration of natural environments is conducive to our overall health by spending time outside in parks forest beaches or other natural environments or walking barefoot our bodies receive a charge of beneficial energy that puts your brain in a balanced state the more time you spend in nature the more beneficial it is to your mental health nature grounds us and surrounds us with positive energy when surrounded by nature our low frequencies start to dissipate and we raise our vibration the people the people you surround yourself with also affect your vibration when youre next to someone your electromagnetic energy field intertwines which explains why some people give you good vibes while others give you bad vibes low vibrational negative people just drain your energy high vibrational positive people just feel good to be around are you in a toxic environment surrounded by negative people who bring you down or are you around positive people who uplift you the food do you give your body the right fuel to function does your diet mainly consist of high vibrational alkaline foods or low vibrational acidic foods highly acidic foods have been linked to multiple diseases and cancers while alkaline foods have been proven beneficial for optimum health your thoughts your feelings your environment the people and the food you put in your body affects your vibration people who vibrate at a higher level feel happier positive and more at peace whereas lower vibrations feel fear more negativity anxiety sadness and poor health be conscious of your vibration for whatever your vibration is is what your quantum field reflects quantum mechanics states that reality is a unified field everything is connectedthe universe is mental its one mind you are a mind a spirit energy a mind is not

first of all im a furry is important for the context meaning i like drawing or do other stuff that involve anthropomorphic animals is a hobby that i really enjoy and i met amazing people into the fandom a lot of people there are so nice and im not planning leave it but as many people should already know the fandom doesnt have the best reputation inside or outside the internet a lot of people call to the furry fandom members as weirdos zoophiles or even pedophiles with weird fetishes actually is something you have to assume if you think become a furry because no matter how good you are people keep thinking the same and i know some people just are trolling but now it reached the point that nobody is sure what is not or is a joke at least for me is completely depressing and horrible to think and question myself if im a criminal by enjoy this hobby it truly hurts not everyone in the fandom are like how is told in media most of the furries are just people who enjoy something as any other person in any other fandom in a sane way im not a criminal im just a person i never would that to an animal or a child ever i have pets and i love em i would be completely against do something that could hurt em,post-pandemic

hello guys as many of you i also had a depression so i just want to share my experience what helps to survive in tough moments of life 1 talk just talk with people about your feelings or write it down it helps 2 meditation of letting go try to learn how to release your inner pain use a lot of online practises it saved my lifereally 3 go outside even if you dont want to fresh air helps to fight with anxiety especially in nature 4 use essential oils especially lemon grapefruit or orange 5 if nothing helps you can always have a stress relief pill but i will not recommend you to take a chemical one cause it is toxic and might cause a big damage to your mind and body in the future me personally use these homeopatic pills it is really helpful and much better than others if you have any tips you can add it on a comments below i wish love and happines for all of you x200b x200b,pre-pandemic

i am so sick and tired of many things these are just some of them people not caring not even enough to check in people using me as a last resort for boredom being left out all the damn time constantly being made to believe i am nothing but a burden to others people thinking i fake being autistic and depressed being singled out and so much more i do not know what i did to deserve to be treated this waybut every friend i have ever made eventually does all these and then eventually just acts like i do not exist no reactions to me pleading for help for advice for comfort nothing i am nothing but sweet and kind to people even if they are jerks towards mebut i get nothing in return i truly believe now that i do not have any friends the ones i do have just use me they dont actually care nobody shows they care enough,post-pandemic

ive been going through bad times for years and i realized before and recently while ive been going through a particularly tough time that i am usually feeling way better when i have people around me i noticed that my depression stems a lot from loneliness and that during times in my life when i was in a relationship i didnt feel the bad days as much but now im thinking what if all of that is just covering up the depression it always comes back especially when i feel alone lately i havent had many friends and for about half a year ive been by myself a lot and i just feel awful however there were definitely moments when i was around friends or bf and i still felt shitty im just not sure what to make of this and how do i become well on my own thats what ive been trying since my last relationship failed but i cant seem to be better and im again trying to find consolation in another person instead of being better on my own but what if i can never be good on my own then im just waiting to feel bad until next time someone leaves me and im all alone,post-pandemic

so my cat apparently got alzheimers and its breaking my heart all the things we have been through he has been there for me like no other person in my life has all the play and joy hardships running in and out to the vet petting him and loving him waking up every morning with him looking at me and meowing following me downstairs and watch me make coffee and now all that is gone its like he seized to exist wiped out his hard drive i got him when i was 14yo my cousin gave him to me when she learned i had a hard time because my mom had cancer and also breaking up with my father my life was in pieces but my cat he mended my heart he gave me love and support when no one else did he was there for me always no matter my mood and i loved him so so much now he is gone but his physical self is there but none of his personality he stopped doing all the things that was him he is only existing atm doing all the necessary things like eat drink sleep poo but not making contact with me not cuddling not meowing i look into his eyes and i dont see him there anymore i am so sad right now i dont know how to think positively about the future without him i feel completely shattered,post-pandemic
im sorry im sure you have been through a lot like we all have but most of the time i just scroll past it or just ignore it and it doesnt impact me positively usually it makes me feel worse because you have gotten through this but for some reason i cant i dunno maybe im just crazy or something but it always makes me feel worse edit i dont mean when people are venting i mean when people are telling you that it gets better or are trying to help,pre-pandemic

these days it seems we can never see eye to eye i know im not the type of human being anyone could ever like unconditionally im seen as stoic quiet unempathetic disagreeable reclusive boring useless but it hurts when the only person i thought i had my own family sees me the same way they dont even hide it anymore why am i still here then what should i do the only thing there is left for me to do is disappear im back at square one before i made any friends worked on my looks dated got a job went back to college or picked up a hobby im back to when i was 12 years old contemplating whether the canyon ledge behind school was high enough to erase my existence back to the days id return to a barren white room with nobody to greet me and the most interaction i had with my family was hearing them screaming at each other through thin walls back to when people had no faces and faces had no names back to when the sun was always so big and the nights were always so long back to when i was so numb i wasnt sure if i was even alive back to the disappointing moment hands encircled my throat but they couldnt even finish the job i thought i finally became a mentally healthy and functional member of society i really thought life was looking up i know depression never really goes away but this house and the people in it are all so suffocating it makes me wonder was there ever a good thing about life,post-pandemic

if i had to sum up my experience thus far in life now 20 it would boil down to two words invisible and expendable i am a realist when people dont talk to me no big deal right they dont want to offend or something about the southern politeness just beckons them to refrain from engaging in conversation fine when people stare at me with a look of disgust or actively avoid being near me i know i am unattractive not the type of unattractive of being unkempt not the type where a simple shower and clothes would fix their disposition i am the type of ugly repulsiveness that has deep structural flaws in ways that despite my best and honest efforts i cannot fix i know that 99999 of the world does not give even a thought to me not even in the echo of a dream but for the 0001 that i have had the pleasure to come face to face with i am systematically and deliberately avoided and demonized as a creep my ugliness is unique but some of the sentiments that i feel are not to be a man especially a white man in my generation is to be guilty of any and all crimes that even the the most deceptive and notroious of others can bestow upon me and like rabid dogs the media will twist and push until i couldnt even donate ice cream to a childrens hospital without being labeled a creep or pedophile or racist or sexist or any other trendy label that the brigade employs to vilify young white men the ironic part of all this is that my generation of men have done nothing terribly wrong we havent waged wars weve not formed lynch mobs weve never destroyed foundations of civilization in the name of equality and social justice ive just barely made it out of high school where i was told that not only was i competing against the entire world for a chance to work a decent job but that i would be actively discriminated against in preference for others of lesser qualifications in the name of diversity and a more personable candidate in this day in age you either have to be exceptionally beautiful or a politically protected minority that whines loud enough get anybody on your side i am neither im sure some people think that i am being a little whiny bastard and that if i work hard and keep with it ill succeed my father says this a lot but his beliefs of my reality are warped by his age and incomprehension that people are genuinely put off by me i have no champion in my political system anymore we are either converts and cannon fodder for the right or bank accounts and scapegoats for the left i would like it most to be left alone without the government around to tell me who i can or cannot marry what i can or cannot put into my body and how i can and cannot defend myself i would also like a government that does things to help the people that need it because the poor are sick and hungry without decent work and a mass of discontent young men has never led to a stable prosperous society women bash men constantly calling us asshole for just existing that we are the scum of the earth because something people at least half a century ago who happened to have the same colored genitals as me did to women who are not them they are allowed to strike men with impunity in the courts and are almost guaranteed to keep a child regardless if they are even able to feed themselves just let the babies father pay for it the court will say while at the same time not allowing the man to see the fruit of his labor people have become entranced by the fairytales that mass entertainment sells them they are perfect and must have the perfect everything or else their life isnt worth anything i too am under this spell but when a sheep think its a wolf it doesnt say it to the other sheep lest itll be left for the wolves to slaughter there are worse things than this fairytale i tell myself each day i wake up at around 6 or 7 when i wake up the first thing i see is myself each day my head is filled with selfhate from sunrise to shut eyes not hate that helpful either i cannot channel that hate into motivation as there is nothing to change im boned any way with a deck stacked so high against me that im climbing everest every morning in my boxers theres no bright future and no path of escape except the obvious but instead im in a thick grey mist headed deep into a maelstrom that might collapse upon me at any instant and apparently i have privilege that i need to check im not a murderer i dont even have the will to kill myself yet but when people wonder why there are so many mass shootings in my country committed by young white men they are so quick to condemn the man or the weapon or talk about how we all need treatment that they never want to look at the realities that we face we are deemed obsolete by everybody protected by no one and told to hate ourselves for choices that are not ours to make we are nothing more than pawns until weve cornered the king,pre-pandemic

it seems rdepression has become a place to post memes that vaguely relate to the illness who does that help it is impossible to sum up depression or how you are feeling with a futurama fry or scumbag brain quickmeme link it wont help you and it wont help others threads that have real meaning and useful advice are comparatively ignored they are unseen by those who dont specifically visit rdepression while the useless memes are seen by everyone who is subscribed here as they pop up on their 2nd or 3rd reddit page just because you can relate in someway to the meme that has been created doesnt mean it helps you or anyone the illness deserves proper recognition in my opinion,pre-pandemic

my mom died yesterday night at around 12 am she killed herself i can only assume she has schizophrenia the previous 2 weeks of her death she was acting totally different nothing of herself she was going on about god she was never religious and how if we dont believe in him we are going to hell it all began from when she was dating this guy joseph and when she came home that night she was totally different i now live with just my dad and sister and all to remind i am just 16 it really hurts she is dead all i can think about it her death i cry off and on and some moments i feel fine then others times i feel numb my family is being supportive but none of them understand this pain they remind me it wasnt her i know it wasnt her my mom would have never done this to us it doesnt change the fact my mom is selfish for killing herself i can still hear the gun shot in the bathroom it hurts to even go into the bathroom to even touch any of her stuff i mourn with happy pictures of her still painful to think she would change so fast i looked through notebooks of hers she used to write like it was her life she wrote lists and lists of things to do chore lists grocery lists activity listsetc it was never ending my mom was always full of life always ready to take on what life gave her she never considered suicide the night of when she killed herself she was preparing us all night it hurt to hear her talk like that she had cuts all over her body and bruises on her thighs from the 48 hours she disappeared that morning she came home naked and wrapped up in blanket apparently walking around the city i want to let every one know that no matter what cherish the people around you and take the sad things seriously never forget that that may be the last time youll see them,post-pandemic

as the title says i feel like im getting worse and worse at everything i feel like im getting weaker much much dumber i used to know a shit ton of trivia a lot of history and be really good at helping people out now ive forgotten most things unless i read up on it daily ive been relying more and more on canned responses when talking to people and ive become completely socially unaware things that used to be easy are now difficult i constantly make typos and i cant even concentrate on things i like much less things i dislike anyone else feel like that,pre-pandemic

lately ive been obsessed with huntergatherers see link they only work three hours a day and its more like play than work hunting collecting chatting with friends while you prepare food etc they have no class system are healthier than us and rarely suffer from depression what is there to be depressed about they dont go to school the idea of telling a child what to do was alien to them they spend so much time idling and sleeping that when europeans first met hunter gatherers they always said these people are lazy it seems to me that when the world horrifies us and nobody else understands why we feel so bad when we just want to stay in bed all day when we hate school or work when the only thing we can imagine enjoying is walking in a forest with no worries when our solution to problems is just i want to walk away then we are absolutely correct we see life as it really is and how it really should be when we stay in bed and want the outside world to go away then we are doing it right and our problem is that everyone else is doing it wrong depression is supposed to be ithis rrational thing but almost everything i read on this sub is rational genius is when we come up with some insight that others cannot see well if the only people who can see the benefit of the huntergatherer lifestyle are the depressed people then i guess we must be the geniuses,pre-pandemic

so i have depression nice to point out the obvious idiot i am not religious so i cant turn to god for help we lost our insurance so i cant get therapy and my family is against medication because it makes you fake which i agree with slightly also people say to do something to take my mind off it but i cant draw when i am distracted by depression i can sing and i love doing it but who do i sing to anyone have suggestions as to what i can do if i can do anything about it,pre-pandemic
i want to kill myself so bad nobody cares about me other than an online friend ive met a couple of days ago i really like talking to her but i always feel that everythings temporary i have always been lonely but im so scared for the fact that she could block me on any moment and everythings going to be as it was im going to be weak vulnerable and pathetic again i wont have anybody who could be there for me when im sad i also feel like shes getting bored pf the fact that i always talk about killing myself even though i have never talked about it while thinking that could make her talk to me more im so depressed and i wish that im dead already but the thing is i live in the middle east and in here a large percent of the population are religious or at least the elderly people and i was raised on if a person kills himself he going to burn in hell for the rest of eternity and thats the only thing holding me back i need definite proof that god isnt real and then ill be free for once and for all,pre-pandemic

it took me 20 years to recognize that i was depressed and another 10 to actually do something about it by seeing a therapist and taking sertraline my problem was and is that i suck at life i got by on 20min of workday in school but that changed and i didnt so i failed at most of the things i started including a 6year relationship two attempts at college and a company last fall i finally faced the music and got on sertraline i always told people that there should be no stigma attached that it does not change your personality etc boy was i wrong yes i felt happier for a while i also slept about 18h a day i did not even notice it until about two weeks ago i was simply once again too lazy to refill the prescription when i went cold turkey i suddenly noticed how much the meds had changed me and not in a good way to put it in simple terms i had gone stupid whereas before and to a limited degree now again i was good with words charismatic and convincing i had become dull when i talked to people it felt like something wasnt right something was off my imagination was nonexistant my creativity stunned i had become bored by my own thoughts but remained unable to come up with new ones i am deeply unhappy now but for some reason i am somewhat productive again the fog that i did not even notice has cleared i am not a good person but at least i am a person when after 150 years of trying modern psychology still cant help a somewhat simple case of depression such as mine maybe they should finally give up but theyre probably too happy to see how much they suck and to gritty to look in the mirror and evaluate themselves pointless rant sorry felt like it yeah by the way cool withdrawal symptoms bro feels like i sat on my brain for too long,pre-pandemic
firstly let me say i truly appreciate anyone who comes here to help and not just people like me who only want attention and sympathy and shit its very selfless to actually want to help people especially intolerably bitchy and downer people like me who if theres one thing were proficient at doing its ruining others days with our moods not because were sadistic but because were uncontrollably moody i guess either way i dont spend my time working live off my gf or socializing or doing anything i spend it worrying and being pissed off about shit all my time is spent in my head i have more severe anxiety and anger than ive ever witnessed in anyone and i dont let anyone see that because then i have to worry about not only them but my self image as a whiney bitch so i keep it all bottled up and now it seems ive completely ruined my health because of this theres not one internal organ in my body that doesnt have concerning pains at least at some point everyday today i get pissed on by my dog and have to walk around for like 30 minutes with piss on me before i could get home and shower and i busted in the door fucking fuming and my gf gives me a sigh and an unenthused what can i do like even shes sick of dealing with my shit which puts me in an even worse spot and i dont mean to say any of this is even the worst of my problems just a tiny not wholly representative peek at how my life goes day in and day out ive never really been as suicidal as i am atm which i guess means that im still not suicidal enough to do anything just at the very rock bottom end of my completely dried out tank which i would assume is the last stop before being truly suicidal idk hell my mom just got out of prison she was always such a classy girly girl who would have been the last candidate on anyones mind for prison and i thought for sure she would have been a changed person and so much more appreciative for life when she got out nope shes just down and depressed as fuck now i spent an entite day of every single weekend for a year to come up and make sure she had someone to visit her including when i was employed and including my whole christmas none of which was seemingly appreciated at all and i want to include that in my suicide note yeah even my mom who did this to herself is all depressed now instead of being happy shes out of that place that was a nightmare for her by her own free will but i couldnt live with the burden of putting a burden like that on my mom for the rest of her life obviously just saying how upsetting it is and how representative it is of this world i want nothing to do with anymore just bitching about my life which nothing has ever gone right for i cant get a job or do anything because im too trapped in my head all day to even motivate myself to wipe my own ass practically ive just never seen a life as unhappy as mine i never had a single friend growing up because even as a child i was plagued by unhappiness and mental disease that i had no idea about or how to go about it cuz i was a kid and my parents obviously never gave a shit to look into my outbursts and rage and loneliness etc so here i sit friendless jobless happinessfree and no recourse because im jobless and have no insurance etc fuck my life,pre-pandemic
im a sophomore in college right now and i am constantly surrounded by wise people people who did things with their lives in high school and didnt waste it away crying starving themselves neglecting their work they were able to partake in extracurriculars in spite of nervousness or not being nervous at all they were able to accomplish things efficiently without attention or memory issues they were able to make friends without poor social cues i had friends who manipulated me and threatened to commit suicide everyday and even then i never had positive influences to help me my parents were so busy with work that since my youth i was always alone at home i have trouble having fun i cant emotionally feel like a happy person its always forced it doesnt come naturally to me so people didnt like people like me im too lazy to write this but basically i feel so bitter i wish i did more so i could show off my potential but nope i wasnt certain of myself ever im trying to improve but my past latches onto me sigh edit i have something to add first i am very happy to see that some people can relate to at least the topic sentence of this post we all feel like we were taken back by years because of some shitty stuff in my past i also didnt get to finish writing this because i hadnt the energy to finish but there were moments where i stopped eating showering and brushing my teeth for very long periods of time i also hid my feelings all the time when people used to say you dont understand it would hurt so much because i really did in some way or so i thought i had speech therapy in middle school and general therapy in high school but i was never very honest because i was always afraid of the consequences i feel a little bit of pride i guess saying this but i feel like im an example of someone who hid all their feelings and just wants it all like all vomited and shat and sweated and cried out of me until i can remove it completely nowadays i struggle to even read sometimes i just dont have the strength but i try i do say though writing this was therapeutic because i am severely overwhelmed saying this but thanks for reading,pre-pandemic

my ex still friendmore than friends basically together minus the label at least until she leaves for the rest of the summer in july and then off to college so shes basically gone after this next week and a half or so but still here we are having fun and running around i just want her so badly and shes the one and ive had this thing inside of me screaming to go and get her since the second i saw her which was a solid year before we actually spoke and exploded into this true love that we both feel she just wants to go and she has this pain inside of her that is caused by something that may as well not even be of this world shes got this connection to something otherwordly and divine that i cannot see and neither can she but she can feel it i can acknowledge it and feel it somewhat through her but not on my own shes got wings and all ive got are legs and shes flying away and i cant do anything and how am i supposed to go find someone else ive seen and experienced a person whos fucking divine and has wings so how can i settle for legs and how can i find another of the rare winged people or whatever they are and give myself to them the way i have to her when i know theyll just fly away later too thats the thing about winged people they have to fly and i dont have wings so they have no choice but to fly away from me im not depressed about not having wings thats okay with me im special in my own way and all after all i attract people with wings im fucking reeling because shes flying away and i cant do anything and she still is so sweet and tells me she loves me and holds me tightly against her and says for all she knows shell be back someday and i cant handle that time inbetween now and someday even though no matter what happens when that someday comes ill drop whatever i have going on to go back to her i tried to open myself to other people i really did when i was away at school i met another girl who i did have love for as a person not in love love and was beautiful and fun and i genuinely enjoyed her company but my winged beauty still danced around my head and heart and screamed louder and louder im scared of not being able to be with someone else completely without going to sleep and dreaming of her like i still always do i need that kind of person who will be in a relationship with me and grow with me but i want and need it to be her too but shes not going to do it now so i dont know what to do because i cant give myself up to another person completely and thats unfair to everyone her leaving and not wanting to be with me she still loves me and wants me in her life but she cant be in a relationship right now is the point she has to be alone and grow alone and in her words perhaps discover she has to be alone forever and live in the mojave desert in isolation but thats a crock of shit its not just a break up please dont patronize me all the promises of forever she made are still in my head and playing and i still see them in her to some degree and she still feels them i think that if she would allow herself to give into her most truly selfish desires shed ask me to wait for her while she was gone in fact she has asked that before part of me wants to but then again theres that part of me that just needs a relationship thats sweet and stable and present and actually physically there not just fleeting promises of that however many years from now and i dont define myself based off of relationships so i dont need the whole take time to yourself thing i cant even possibly begin to do the story of us and me and this and everything justice in my emotionally frenzied state on some subreddit im just trying for something anything because i feel like im dying and ive been crying for a long time im sick of wasting every wish on her staying with me part of me feels like i need her to just be cut out of my life so i can really move on but thats so horribly painful and were best friends i cant do that to her or myself i just want her i just do my love for her and us forever is the truest thing i have ever felt in all my life more so than 224 but i dont want to feel this way i want someone who will hold me one day and not fly away the next im just so lost and dont know what to do i dont know what i want anyone to say i dont know if any of this makes sense im sure it sounds crazy we really had such good times and we still do just yesterday when i saw her last was so sweet and lovely and simple and fun and just at ease i was at peace she brings me peace and gives me strength and courage but she also takes it all away without meaning to just as quickly i dont know what to make of that story of my life with her why why why why why because what else can you say when nothing makes sense,pre-pandemic

i dont know if this is the right place to post but here it goes as a man that has never had a girlfriend been kissed and is still a virgin i have serious doubts if i still desire any human relationship platonic or romantic i had a very sheltered adolescence and i missed out on a lot things part of me still wants to experience but given my age it would be vastly inferior to the experience i would have gotten at 19 theres a magic that is to be had in adolescence in human relationships that can never be replicated as an adult women peak physically between 18 and 22 and they really drop as the years go by they are also at their most fun im at an age now where a lot of women are beginning to become marriage and child hungry theres a seriousness and maturity to adulthood that makes human relationships dull i really think i should never give dating a chance at this point truth is what i truly want is a replication of what i could have gotten in my adolescence and college years i really wish i had the college experience i wish i can date 19 year olds but societys pressure is overwhelming i miss the energy and innocence of those years theres nothing i can do however and im stuck with a ugly boring old lot im open to children but if only and only if my partner waited till my mid40s thats a big ask and i may as well not have them at all but im serious when i say i want to make up for lost time thats why im high on the idea of an agegap relationship and i am open to adaption this turned into a long rant but i just think dating is something i missed the boat on friendships as well adult friendships suck i just think romantic relationships are just too serious now when i really just want to have innocent fun giving dating and human relationships in general a chance at this point would just result in painfully dull and difficult disappointment in my opinion,post-pandemic

ive been struggling a lot this week my mental health has always been shit but lately its just gotten worse i recently fired my therapist because my insurance changed and she wasnt accepting the new provider she wasnt a good fit for me either but something is better than nothing so aside from my boyfriend and a few friends i dont have anyone i can rely on i feel bad venting to the people around me because theyre all going through tough times too and it just doesnt feel fair for me to unload on them so i hope that opening up to this sub is the right idea even though i still feel guilty expressing my pain the heart of it all is that i have cptsd along with other psych disorders and these past few weeks ive been drifting in and out of disassociation flashbacks and episodes of crying fits i cant stop reliving my trauma and am having a tough time with positive selftalk right now id say my selfworth and selfesteem are at a 0 it doesnt help that i live in an abusive household but unfortunately i dont have anywhere else to go and this is something ive dealt with my whole life my mother is neglectful and my father is emotionally verbally and sometimes physically abusive he picked a fight with me this morning for no reason and it set me over the edge so between the flashbacks disassociation and deeply painful depression i just feel so unsafe in my house if my parents see me crying theyll either gaslight or bully me i just wish things were different i dont really know where im going with this post other than it would be nice to be reminded that not everyone is mean and nasty that i am a good person and i deserve a good life i just want to stop crying x200b edit thank you for the wholesome the silver and the hugz i did not expect this post to get any attention let alone receive my first reddit awards im crying tears of joy and hope now thank you kind internet strangers i will be sure to pay it forward 3 edit 2 wow this outpouring of support was so not expected im trying to respond to everyone but its taking longer than expected so in the case that i missed your comment thank you,post-pandemic
i should start by saying i dont know if im depressed or whats really wrong with me but somethings been wrong for a really long time my moms side of the family has severe mental health problems and i know that contributes to my messed up brain chemistry however for the past 5 years ive been working constantly and havent had much time to address it i talked to a therapist twice and didnt feel much of a connection and didnt try again afterwards although i know i need to anyway sorry for the ramble im looking for some advice on how to deal with minor inconveniences ruining my mood and day this morning my favorite bakery didnt have something i usually get and i just felt my heart sink i immediately felt like the world was falling apart and its been probably 2 hours since then and im still lying in bed crying my mind is telling me i cant get up i cant go to work i cant study for this test ive been studying for for so long it ruins all my plans for the day i feel like such a pathetic loser every time this happens and i dont know how to cope with it until i can find a therapist to talk to i know its literally the smallest unimportant thing but this is just an example it could be anything this small and my mood just changes instantly sometimes i want to break things or hurt myself or hurt other people its just a lot of feelings all at once this would be really helpful for my upcoming test too i tend to talk to myself really negatively and if i mess up or dont do as well as i think i should i fall even deeper into the pattern of everything falling apart thank you for all your help,post-pandemic
im getting so tired of trying to try or love everything i do feels so pointless i worry and cry alone all the thoughts in my head are shared alone my life has been full of people that are supposed to care about me but hurt me instead my dad always hurt me my mom hurt me and left every relationship feels like im always the one making problems i feel so useless and unwanted ive tried to end it and im still here still always tired and questioning the point of everything i dont see a point anymore honestly i think oh ill do this and get better just for it to be ruined by my own thoughts and trauma or by someone else giving me more reasons for those thoughts and creating trauma its just an endless cycle of pain and false hope for something better im just so lost and tired of hoping for people to change or me to even change i dont know what to do anymore,post-pandemic

i just want to share my experience with depression couple of months ago my girlfriend for 3 years broke up with me it was tough because i didnt expect it to happen after the break up i couldnt eat and sleep well most of the time i was sad i was even crying everyday it came to the point that i was so tired of dealing with depression that i wanted to commit suicide but one day i woke up and realized that i needed to surrender this depression to god and ask help from him so im praying everyday that hopefully i will overcome this depression one day and i noticed that im getting better every single day that passed im not yet happy right now and still in the process of healing but one day i know i will be happier than ever i just need to be patient and trust god with his plan to everyone who can read this please know that youre loved and you are not alone i am here with you and most importantly god is with you,post-pandemic
but honestly being positive is in my nature i look for the best in everyone and everything even when i feel so down my inner me is in a constant battle with the negativity depression pushes inside my head which is of course what happens to everyone when you have depression as a positive person its weird because you know you dont mean it but it is there if this makes any freaking sense lmao,pre-pandemic
im not really expecting sympathy as i know what i did was wrong note this is going to be long lol so basically ive been seeing this guy online for three months now and we instantly hit it off we were texting each other constantly everyday but little did he know that i was actually a catfish who posed as a pretty cute person who was just camera shy this was my first time catfishing and instantly after a day of doing it i deleted my account from the dating site but kept in contact with him without telling him who i was now this relationship lasted through november and december which were both of our exam months which gave me the perfect excuse to why i couldnt meet him since we both live in the same area he was the perfect guy to me we shared stories our feelings and talked about what we did on that day he was everything that i wanted to be he was sporty popular and talented what made me fall for him though was that he was so supportive during my exams were he would actually take his time for a couple hours and tutor me over time i just stopped sending him photos and he didnt care he thought i was just shy but in reality my guilt was just building up i wanted to tell him badly but before i did i sought help on subreddits such as ramiugly and others to get a sense of how i looked obviously this was a major mistake on my part and resulted in a major blow in my confidence levels i was a wreak and still am i told him i was a catfish 3 days ago and to my surprise he took it really well and forgave me really well he actually complimented me on how i was such a good catfish to my surprise he confessed that he also catfishes other people but instead he catfishes people for fun this was going great until he confessed that he had a boyfriend all a long and he was pretty promiscuous but this thought never would have crossed my mind i showed him my real photos and he rated me a a 5510 i was completely average to him i was not too bad he wanted to remain friends and so i did the consequences honestly i think ive been let off easier than most people but a part of me wishes he just totally broke ties with me this was my first relationship that felt meaningful with a person looking at his pictures kills me inside and i havent talked to him for 2 days now i feel empty and alone the nightly ritual that we once had of talking from 11 pm to 4 am was gone i dont know what to do this catfishing scheme only resulted in many many insecurities i think ive fallen into depression i feel lonely jealous of his life ugly inadequate on top of this is other things like my joblessness i find myself comparing my life with his he was everything i wanted to be im not sure if i should even still talk to him i find myself thinking about him every minute of my day i know i can never compete with his boyfriend he is un reachable now this will be my first and last time catfishing im not sure if this is the effects of losing a friend having my first breakup being called extremely average or both thanks for reading my rant if youre still here lol if youre the one i catfished sorry again i really wish to talk like we used to this is a horrible way to celebrate the new year a part of me wishes that i had confessed after my christmas break to remain happy just a little longer ps for those who are confused im a guy too tldr i catfished another guy fell in love after he supported me for so long i confessed found out he had a boyfriend all a long and that he thinks im average af im depressed now after my first breakup because i miss him and never can get him,pre-pandemic

so im not really sure what i expect from posting on here but being able to anonymously vent what i need im getting burnt out in general of my love life i know im not the only one everyone has a different situation but i feel like my love life couldnt possibly get any worse i want to be able to say positive things about the man i love on here i want the world to know how much i love him i want him to know how much i love him some background info im 20 female hes 21 male weve been dating off and on since 8th grade and were engaged to get married last year but the wedding fell through due to reasons id rather not discuss hes in the airforce and i just graduated with my ba current problem currently i dont even know why i should bother getting up in the morning we arent officially together because we got into a fight 4 days ago and broke up he told me he needed space but we could still act like were together the real problem is that his idea of space is talking to me for about 3 minutes total all day then hanging out with his friends the rest of the time i need to explain that typically we would call each other when we were in the car with down time we would sleep on skype every night and text each other sweet things and updates on what were doing all the time we would even help each other pick out our clothes for each other like we were actually there right now were at the point where hell just tell me hes basically deleted me from his life except for when its convenient for him he doesnt tell me its revenge for mistakes ive made in the past but i feel like thats part of it i think another part is that the military has just made him forget whats important i havent seen my man on good terms since august of last year we saw each other in january but he had some issues that he still cant explain and we didnt have a good time i tried making plans to see him in may but the only time i could get off was his 21st birthday which was the weekend we were supposed to be getting married and he didnt want me there since i couldnt go out to drink i just feel like we go through these ups and downs of him needing his space which means he completely ostracizes me from his life and makes his friends priority i feel guilty that i have to feel like its a competition but i also cant help but feel that the past has made me feel this way i just wish hed be more understanding i wish i had moved there as soon as i was out of school so we could give each other a fair chance right now hes out drinking and watching movies with his friends having his distance im at work crying because i dont mean as much to the man i love as i thought i did i hope he knows that ill still love him a year from now even if we arent together,pre-pandemic

i have fought a thousand battles without a weapon i have taken a thousand blows without a shield i have heard a thousand screaming voices tearing me down day in day out telling me how worthless i am how useless this all is how broken i make the world i have pulled myself a thousand times from a bed i dont find rest in i have put my foot before the other a thousand times making myself walk into a new day i have performed a thousand fake smiles a thousand fake good mornings and a thousand hollow laughs i have lived a thousand dark nights in the broad day for everything i have done for all that i have bourne without armour or assistance for all the pretence and lies i say for every battle i win inside me i feel nothing but a hollow ring a sucking silence a vibrating anticipation for the monster waiting in my soulwaiting for when i am alone waiting for that one wrong look that one wrong word waiting for my failure but as i hear its talons click closer as i feel the darkness sink into me again i raise my fists i clench my teeth i breathe because i am a soldier because i pull the tide because i saved someone by saying thank you for being alive because i love chocolate caramels because i deserve to live,pre-pandemic
this has probably happened hundreds of times in my lifetime im 50 now so obviously i havent succumbed to depression yet but the peaks and valleys are insane i guess im insane yesterday it fully made sense to me if i had had immediate means to end my life i could see taking that action this is why i can never have a gun or live in a tall building so far that small voice in me that says it will get better just wait has remained more powerful than the other larger louder voice that says youve always been alone youll always be alone life isnt worth the pain my reality is having both of those voices in my brain and feeling that both are absolutely real when theyre there,pre-pandemic

how the fuck do people keep going to work every day how am i supposed to keep doing this im literally just working part time at a coffee shop but i feel as though i am in agony every day its all meaningless and worthless we literally work a job so we can afford to live another day to work our job i cant even begin to comprehend how anyone is happy my family work so much more than i do and i can tell theyre stressed out but they push through i just cant wrap my mind around it fuck just fuck it all i fucking hate being alive in this world i appreciate all the replies i dont really have it in me to respond individually so ill just say here thanks for the good wishes and for sharing your own struggles its a shitty world but its what we got i guess its on us to make something of it its just that some of us like me are really really bad at doing that lmao,post-pandemic
the short version of the story is that i believe this depression could be alleviated if she would just take responsibility for her actions and actually apologize to me she cheated on me and when she dumped me i told her i loved her and id forgive her well we kept talking as the weeks went by talked about getting back together multiple times and each time we did she went out that night and fucked the guy she cheated on me with and later bragged to me about it i was upset she went out of her way to be as horrible as possible to me i cant stand it now im getting threats from her friends and mine that im going to get my ass beat if i dont accept she did nothing wrong and im just being an asshole i have done nothing but express my desire to forgive her but everyone is so determined to white knight that ive lost everything i cant believe i could be betrayed so heavily and the meds arent exactly helping,pre-pandemic
two things mirapex and wellbutrin have helped my depression and anxiety secondly if you are a christian its not about cutting off sin its about loving god so much that that the desire is not there and the anxiety and depression are down i may have gotten off topic but i am an alcoholic 10 weeks sober by focusing on god and im not depressed i dont need a beer,post-pandemic

i am the elder sibling in a dysfunctional family of 4 parents always fought with each other when i was a kid they resorted to physical violence with each other more often than not they were extremely strict with me and resorted to hitting me and being extremely critical of me in order to discipline me we were not well off financially so both my parents worked very hard to provide for me i could sense that if i did not achieve something big in life all their hard work will amount to nothing i worked very hard at school and college to be the brightest student in class but i am failing hard at my career right now it has been 3 year since i graduated and i was stuck at a job that i did not want to do in the first place i got lost at the same time covid hit and i was faced with a lot of health difficulties post covid like pcod endometriosis i started taking birth control for it and i am still yet to figure out if my depression and anxiety was because of it or because of my life circumstances i started facing a lot of muscle related issues like back pain ankle tendonitis etc due to which my activity in the gym reduced it was one place that made me feel active and sleep better at night i was also in a toxic relationship at the time which left me feeling unsupported in all this amidst all this my parents kept persuading me to find someone and get married the mental toll of these experiences was too much to bear i resigned from my shitty job and stayed with my parents asking them to support me for a few months while i seek therapy and try to take care of my health i have been diagnosed with depression and anxiety which i am working on at therapy and i am also working on my physical health and took a break from thinking about my career while my parents have been understanding of my situation my younger sibling continues to hurt me emotionally she is rude and disrespectful does not perform her share of chores in the house but in turn creates more of a mess which i am supposed to clean up when asked to do it she raises her voice calls me a bitch and says some really hurtful personally directed insults like i am incapable of things i am a burden etc she has always been the rebel daughter she has messed up so many times in her life like always getting into trouble in school getting involved in physical fights with people having a relationship with older guys flunking out of college etc my parents were extremely worried and they did everything in their power to understand her but they have given up we have collectively stopped interacting with her in the house her upbringing was completely different from mine she wasnt hit to be disciplined we were at a good place financially when she was born so she got everything she asked for my parents reached a better place in their marriage too she is known to be extremely social confident and charming among relatives and friends she wasnt expected to do anything or be anything except herself but inside the house she is abusive and rude and cruel her presence over powers everyone elses existence she has started using my failed career to make me feel worthless she knows thats my trigger she knows that the mere mention of it will make me have a breakdown i fall for it every time and it makes me so so angry to even look at her i have started to hate her and i started wishing that bad things happen to her i hate this side of myself because it makes me feel like a bad person and i also believe in karma but her arrogance and reckless behavior and her lies and manipulation makes me want to punch a wall i get so overwhelmed and hopeless that i want to not live i get thoughts about what would happen if i die how will it affect other people i dont know where all this pain is coming from but when something triggering or overwhelming happens not just wrt my family but even with my health or career or relationships the thought of killing myself pops up and eases the pain but also makes me very sad that i have reached this level of rock bottom i would appreciate any advice on how i can deal with this situation,post-pandemic

nothing i do will no matter how great will allow me to feel good about myself ive done it all surrounded myself with great people tried every med under the sun got in shape got into plenty hobbies but there will always be a rain cloud over my head a dark hole in my soul that cannot be mended i just wish i could feel good about myself just once i have anger and hatred toward happy people and people that can go about life care free i pray heaven is so much better than this temporary body my day was even more ruined by some pretty girls who laughed at me while doing my run but hey at least i ran 5 miles doesnt matter though when the people you try to please snicker at you i wish i couldve been the muscular jock with a huge johnson that just lives life on easy mode instead the majority of my life was being a fat kid until 8th grade even after years of work i cant ever be enough to be appreciated or even just ignored the only thing that i can hold dear to my heart is christ im so exhausted with living and im so young my body aches my mind aches more i hope i can make it through this cruel world to die by old age c bless you for reading this i hope you conquer your battles,post-pandemic
much of my depression is because we live in a society where 99 of our problems could be solved if rich people and rich countries were not so greedy i am scraping by every single day because i cant afford therapy theres no universal healthcare in my country and i have the crippling weight of student loans and poor credit ruined by those student loans so i am trapped in an endless cycle of poverty i turned to alcohol to numb my pain and its made me into a fullblown alcoholic which has made my depression even worse i cant afford rehab at all so relapse and suffer in shame i dont want a billion dollars but just being able to afford medical care and have a roof over my head would solve a lot of my problems whenever i see rich people suffering it brings me joy i know its sick but i view all the superwealthy as corrupt and evil people my country only cares about wealthy people and it makes me so angry people are exploited daily yet someone pays 250k to see an over 100 yr old ship when that 250k could change peoples lives i hate this world so much,post-pandemic

ive come to the conclusion that ultimately you create your own depression you obviously dont mean to and its so easy for humans to slip into a depressive state if you create it then it stands to reason that you can destroy it and you are the only one who can therapy and medication help they definitely help but theyre never the final fix the final push the final breakthrough has to and can only come from your inner willpower,pre-pandemic
i cant seem to get it together im nearly 40 married with 2 kids have progressively worked to a point where i have a really well paid job trouble is its all a house of cards which tumbles down harder each time and im tired so tired my wife is at the point of leaving me and i can understand why i have had depressive episodes in the past but shes told me that she cant keep supporting me as its impacting her mental wellbeing and i understand that i have been a horrible shit in the past and she has always stood by me my finances are in the toilet we have no security despite my good wages and i make stupid money decisions because i think my family deserve everything im now therefore trapped in a job i dont particularly like but as i have no social life and no friends i turn to work as my way of escaping and chasing some big chance i lie to everyone cant engage in social situations as i have imposter syndrome and feel like any plans i make are not fair on my family i had counselling last year but stopped as i cant afford it and the waiting list for local healthcare counselling rightly prioritises more serious cases im reading a path through the jungle but just think whats the point ill fuck it up anyway i constantly have stress headaches but as my wife has significant health issues my headaches seem inconsequential in comparison we have no security and live month to month i just had a holiday cancelled by the agent which has upset and annoyed my wife but i didnt have the confidence or heart to tell her i couldnt afford it lots of people will read this and think how dare they good job family and that is on my mind 247 ive had very low mood recently but try my hardest in front of my kids who are everything to me i know i probably need to make some hard decisions but honestly feel so much that i would be letting my family down if i make them as it would have a significant impact on their lives feel trapped and alone but also like a fraud,post-pandemic

i recently had an awakening and i realized that i have self sabotaged myself my whole life girls and people in general but mostly girls not giving me all their attention automatically meant i was worthless and every time i passed a girl on the street that didnt look my way it further reiterated and crystallized that concept into my head when im talking to a girl and something as small as her not texting back instantly happens it automatically means im worthless i never voice these feelings and i end up walking away but i always paint them as the villain i blame them and i genuinely suffer from pain but i make it all up all my heart breaks every single one was caused by me walking away and shutting them out and blaming them in my head they rejected me they betrayed me and i believe it but now i see its all fake but it felt so real how could the suffering i went thru for 5 years be fake how can this be fixed how do i stop how do i stop being an overly sensitive over reactive little b,post-pandemic

update so i thought it would only be fair to post this update while one friend still doesnt seem to give a fuck im meeting another friend for lunch tomorrow turns out shes been having a thyroid flare up one other friend also wants to make lunch plans soon so well see about that some people care but have stuff going on other people dont care pay more attention to the former original post seriously fuck everyone its so easy to say after someone ends their life that they should have reached out to a friend and talked but whos really willing to listen only a select few of us are blessed with friends who listen with sympathy and respond in a timely way the rest of them are just faffers capitalism has rotten human relationships to the core and everything has become disposable including friendships hang on with dear life to those who really care about you and are willing to talk more often than not its people who have struggled with mental illness themselves edit it is usually better to talk to a therapist if you can afford therapy that is about issues that friends do not have the professional training to deal with i dont recommend burdening other people with all your issues because that would just drive them away people have enough shit in their own lives to deal with however it sucks if you want to talk with a friend who clearly knows youre going through a tough time and they dont return your call edit 2 looking back at my post i realise i sound a little angry and cynical but i really wish for a culture where mentally ill people could get the nurturing and support they need a big part of that is also having access to mental health professionals who are capable and helpful if you can please seek the help of a therapist it has helped me realize where my boundaries with others lie and how i can strengthen my own self to ask of others what i needdeserve from them it can be a longdrawn process and you might not always land a good therapist at the first attempt but please persevere if you have the means thanks to everyone for your comments im trying to reply to each one but its hard to keep up so im sorry if i miss yours rememberyoure worth the effort and the struggle so please hang in there edit 3 if youre in the us uk canada or aus you can use this directory to find a therapist near you read about them what insurance they take etc,pre-pandemic

i grew up in the evangelical church and i always hated the idea of heaven i wasnt worried about going to hell but the idea of having to continue to exist after death was unbearable i could not even imagine existing without suffering as much as an anglerfish cant imagine hiking a mountain its my understanding that this is an unusual perspective but i find great comfort now in the confidence that when i die i will cease to exist i will not miss anyone or have any regrets about my life i will not be sad i will not be lonely i will not be relieved i will not be at peace i simply will not be while am not afraid of death i am afraid of dying alone not that i wont have anyone in general but being alone just in those final moments its one of the few things that keeps me around that ending my life would have to be done alone,post-pandemic

i know how depression works no one really helped me at least they tried i was almost completely alone you know it is really hard to get out of that trap once youre depressed you might want to stay depressed bad idea it is really important not to waste your life like that think about it depression can lead to a shorter life been depressed for several years i remembered when i used to be a little happy last year because i just moved to the united states that time it all got ruined until i started to get bullied i was trying my best to be nice it just got worse i get lower grades and lost motivation i had interest in science i had a gf but we stopped talking and it got me worse today we are talking now but the thing is it doesnt matter if you have gf or not if you dont you might be more depressed dont you will have a good one eventually if you are happier now how did i cure my own depression i remembered today how much fun i had when i was doing things i realized i could have been way more prepared or successful for my future depression does nothing but consume you it isnt good it is there to ruin your life now you might be questioning your existence if you exist its for a good reason there is too many chances that you could not exist why waste that chance you can live once god loves you if you dont believe in god you should he will forgive you and guide you i recommend going to church every sunday so you can learn why not give it a chance if there is nothing else left just get out of depression if you cant it doesnt mean that you are weak it means you really need to try harder do absolutely anything possible to get out of it its nothing but a trap get motivated look for a better future now before its too late i believe in all of you if you have no idea what your future should be there are many things to get inspired i listened to monstercat instinct vol 3 which made me motivated to do things there is a website called artstation that has pretty cool art dont ruin it all by thinking you are never going to be that good or i cant do this it takes time i know you will be good if you practice dont rush on anything if you fail learn and move on whatever you do dont fall into the great hole of depression,pre-pandemic

ive been doing this since i was younger and i think its time to see if people can relate this ones about passive suicidal tendencies and how it feels my demon i try to drown out the pain but the noise is too loud the darkness is creeping in slower and slower and i cant see the light at the end but the darkest of blacks is taking over i dont know how to think and i dont know what to say the quiet is where i can be at home yet not get away the panic sets in my body trembles my face goes numb i dont know what to do its taking me back back into the cage of this emotionless shell i ball up in the corner and try to hide but i cant escape whats to come now everything is turning from blues to black and time fades just like my hope thats all i can feel as the pit in my stomach begins to swallow me from the inside out i try to let out a cry but nothing nothing comes out and that allows the pain to set through my body the ever changing tides and emotional swings always bring me to my knees i cant escape them and the pit begins to grow i feel too much yet it feels like nothing at all because love and war become one if it isnt shown the love i have it turns into an emotional battlefield that i cant escape i cant see whats right and i cant see whats wrong the shell that thats me does not belong it weeps from the inside yet smiles all around no one knows what is dragging me to my death all these emotions set a blaze inside its burning me and i cant let it to get out as time resumes i feel the chard remains of what is me i see the emotion fading as traffic collides my shell is thrown and soul is not inside its an empty vessel with the thoughts of emotional suicide but i must continue the task at hand to drown out the pain yet the noise intensified its coming again my demon inside sw,post-pandemic
saying things like shes so emotional hahaha and telling her friend everything i just said that was making me upset everything about me is just a joke to her just a topic of discussion for her to gawk over i dont even know why im crying what else should i expect from someone who hasnt ever given me any kind of legitimate emotion support,pre-pandemic
it was tense i talked him through some dark stuff he showed empathy like no other and i immediately felt like i already knew him and vice versa at the end of the session he asked for my id for administrative purposes when he saw my date of birth and realized it was my birthday he cracked up and through his chuckles he demanded who the hell sets up an appointment on his birthday of course i couldnt care less if it was my birthday i tend to forget my own age however his laugh was so genuine and from such a good heart that at last i recognized the ridiculousness and joined his laughter it was the first time i felt 100 comfortable with another person in the same room i couldnt have asked for a better present edit i cant thank you all enough for the wishes and positivity ive been an active rdepression dweller for the past few months and ive never been let down recovery or not this community will always have a special place in my heart the bond that links your true family is not one of blood but of respect and joy in each others life i know its far fetched but it applies for me today,pre-pandemic
though it might be the fifth time i will not kill myself or commit suicide the real suicide for me is struggling to live burdening yourself of extreme loneliness ill just try to live but ill never try to enter relationships again ever in my life so what happens when i got friendzoned again ill probably just try to graduate in college find a job here in my place and then when i finally got the chance i would probably leave somewhere aboard like japan or canada and there i would just settle down find a stable job and be like that lifeless workforce stuck in his cubicle everyday working for nothing in his life i would probably get bullied in my workplace and i will find no one for my life and socially isolate myself to people and live most of my adult life forever alone and then admit myself to a reckless psychiatrist carelessly prescribing me with antidepressants mood stabilizers and sleepinducing pills after that i will probably get older and retire and because i am now unfit to live alone and i will probably stay in a home for the aged forever sitting somewhere seeing the sunset as it go down every afternoon till the day i die alone my funeral would probably consist of only two gravediggers and a priest no one would ever remember me after i leave the place i live right now after i die what a happy life no no one would probably read this shit anyway,pre-pandemic
time doesnt have the same weight anymore it flies by i can see my life falling apart yet am unable to do anything about it no drive to do anything im either stuck in the past which is beyond repair or the uncertain future feel sleepy all the time i know how much of an valuable asset time is but life just doesnt appeal to me at this point why is there so much noise in my head a serene mind is all i wish for but it seems nigh impossible to achieve so much mental struggle always overthinking about something irrelevant i havent progressed in any field of my life in the last few years its a joke,post-pandemic

i was quite shocked at their reactions i sorta expected a very stigmatized reaction for some reason the first professor blew up on me in immediate concern for my wellbeing he too had actually been through similar circumstances when he was younger and the second professor he had a close friend who was suicidal and very depressed as well he was very calm throughout the whole conversation actually that was a really fucking cool thing to have a legit chat about mental health with college professors edit i really cant express enough how reassuring all of your supportive comments are i would like everyone to know that i actually just recently started therapy for the first time this semester and it is doing wonders hopefully i get the courage to schedule with the on campus psychiatrist soon to see if medication can help also thank you all for reminding me that people do care about others thank you greatly,pre-pandemic
what do you bitches want all i want is for girls to be attracted to me i dont think there is anything so wrong with me that i should be disgusting yet i cant seem to get girls to find me attractive enough to fuck meanwhile my fucking roommate who hates sex and wishes he had no sex drive can get any girl he wants he has had a new girl every month in the year that ive known him he even stole a girl from me girls reject me because im horny and want sex once i bring up sex they run away why i just dont get it i dont see why wanting sex means that no one wants to have sex with me it just seems so unfair and so unreasonable people say i should stop wanting it that i should take a break or that i should just hide my sex drive i try but that is very hard i dont really know how to do it and when i meet a girl and dont talk to her about sex she just friendzones me all of this just makes me want to die sometimes other times it makes me want to kill my roommate or girls or everyone honestly im just frustrated and very angry,pre-pandemic

i have suffered from depression for a few years it comes and it goes anyway my friends told me to go see a therapist even though i was skeptical there was a form that asked me various things and to rate my response on a scale of 110 questions included you feel like there is nothing to look forward to in life you feel like you are worthless you feel like you are worth less than other strangers you cant find any joy in life in the middle of reading these and realising i had to give a 1010 to all those responses i gave up handed the form back to the receptionist and went home i was sitting at home genuinely considering hanging myself before coming to my senses and snapping out of it anyone else dealt with stuff like this,post-pandemic
as the title says i am trans and i will go back to that after i give some context to why im even posting here i have been struggling with depression since i was 13 and at the same time realized i was trans but denied it because i wasnt ready to deal with that for all those years since it started ive had very bad episodes of being depressed for months sometimes i get better for no reason then go back to wanting to kill myself i started medication when i was 15 or 16 and have had that medication up until a few days ago i have been going through the process of changing my mecidatiom and now im off meds and im pretty sure all of you know thats a slow process today i start in a new school and have to move to a dorm because the school is in a different city im already stressef because firstly i dont have any strenght or motivation to study and now comes the part about me being trans i came out to my mom stepdad and sibling when i was 15 and my dad and stepmom when i was 16 but i havent told an irl friend i will be going to the sale school with and i dont want to but if i dont tell her and explain why i want to be called something else then my deadname i will have to be deadnamed and misgendered by the teachers and that friend for the next 23 years if anyone here is trans im sure they know that doesnt feel nice to be closeted just bc youre scared or dont have the strength to deal with the possible outcomes of peoples reactions and so on i also have social anxiety and never really had friends irl atleast not ones that stayed or even cared about me since ive struggled with that i cant risk losing an only irl friend by coming out i dont want to be alone at school anymore been bullied since i was 7 up until i was 15 so i dont want any more of that or having to sit alone or eat alone last school i was at i had some sort of friends but not those kinda people that i would come out to or even talk to after school and i didnt i am extremly depressed right now i have been through so much shit and rn while being on the damn edge and trying not to end my life i dont have the strenght for any of this i rather just pass away i dont want anyone to worry as im not planning anything but i really need some support,post-pandemic
i 24f cant help but feel so guilty for being depressed and anxious but my boyfriend 25m does not indicate any frustration at all right now we have immigrated to another country from the uk and whilst we wait for certain visas to come into place we cannot work or earn an income this has taken way longer than supposed to due to unforeseen circumstances and it is killing me jnside ive dealt with depression and anxiety since the age of 13 and always managed to control it myself with talking things out etc until 2020 my grandad died in 2020 and my whole world collapsed i have been through cbt etc and this has all helped right now i cant sleep until 4 am waking up at 10 am and cant bring myself to do anything around the house boyfriend is volunteering at work until he can rejoin as an employee so he is out 7305 every day and sometimes he comes home to an absolute mess he doesnt say anything he hugs me asks how im doing and will pick up the hosue and cook us dinner the only thing he expresses is his worry i have heard him crying on the phone to his mum about feeling helpless i really dont want to burden him and i feel so guilty and scared that this is going to affect our relationship background been together four years and he was there for my depressive episode in 2020 he is amazing and when it comes to my mental health he has no faults he does everything he can i just dont want it to get too much for him any support or advice would be great,post-pandemic
im obvously much more inferior to heterosexuals because only heterosexuals can have a normal family i wish there was a way to get rid or cure homosecuality because it is a genetic dead end i believe its a mistake of evolution homsoexuality should not actually exist and because i will never produce offspring im therefore useless and i will probably kill myself sooner or later i will not kill myself if there is a cure otherwise i will certainly do it,pre-pandemic
it would be nice to have the unconditional kind of love and care you offer to others but we all know that life will never work that way reality sucks we all know better to expect any one person or any group of people to be there for you when you really need itonly works for a short period of time they will only offer help temporarily but they also all have their own lives to work om and deal with so in the end youre expected to just get over it or to find help elsewhere never expect someone to be there for you expectations create hope and unanswered hope always means pain and suffering and being alone again when no one bothers to show up for you like you would for them its a strange thing when society tells you to reach outyet reaching out and becoming a burden to others is part of the problem reaching out causes dependence which only leads to disappointment i dont want to disrupt other peoples lives by reaching out and becoming even more of a burden i want everyone to go on with their happy lives i wish i could just crawl into a hole somewhere and sleep forever and for everyone to forget about me it would be better this way for everyone i feel so incredibly exhausted i just want to sleep there was a time earlier last year when i had made all the plans to distance myself from everyone and unalive my existence i was told by people around me at the time that i seemed the most happiest and relaxed ive ever beenbut plans fell through i missed my timing and now i feel stuck there is so much pain and anger inside me i recently had an outburst of this anger but was told to apologise for acting out on my feelings my feelings never matter how i feel will never be a priority it hurt a lot to realise that neither family or people who i though were my friends but only ever used me for their convenience ever considered how hurt i feel i turn 30 this year 30 years of being worthless i had hoped that i wouldnt be exisiting to this age i almost died a few years ago unintentionally it was the most peaceful feeling ive ever had tooi crave that feeling if i cant unalive myself the best way is to disassociate and become numb to everything to isolate myself from the world people rarely give a thought about me anyways im tired of reaching out only to have silence as my response heres to hoping i can quietly isolate myself forever for the good of society and for the happiness and lives of everyone around me,post-pandemic
i am in my 20s there was a recent period in my life where i was really happy where i had friends that liked my company appreciated me made me feel important loved and gave me a sense of belonging life was so wonderful i looked forward to waking up every morning i hated afternoons because i had to wait till the next day to see my friends it was like i was living a dream and it was entirely real i smiled and laughed more during this period than i had before in my whole life i felt heard and safe i was invincible but something happened something bad all it took was for me to lower my guard a little bit i trusted the people around me a little bit too much i did not see the enemies and the bad people among them i lost myself in the happy times and when i think about it i really did lose myself and most of what i had what made me happy and made my life worth living i created a near unfuckedupable situation for myself what happened did not have to happen it was and is so stupid random and unnecessary my days are now painful hard and sad i am nearly dead inside and everything feels pointless as i sit here i cannot stop my tears from flowing while i am writing this as i reminisce all my happiness i cannot help but think that i had my chance at a happy life but i lost it and i am done for now i pray that god takes mercy on my soul and gives me a break nobody should ever have to feel the way i do right now i want things to get better like they were before i always have these moments where the sadness hits and it is unbearable any useful and constructive advice is welcome sending love to everyone be kind,post-pandemic
im so lost in this relationship she doesnt even sit by me anymore she would rather gloat and sit between 2 older black dudes she hates me obviously she knows how i feel when she neglects me this way but yet she still does it she doesnt care how i feel this makes her feel good i just want her comfort and to not want me upset like this she cant find it within herself to make me happy anymore she doesnt love me she never did she was just comfortable,pre-pandemic
im tired of trying i have been shing recently due to a bad relapse and my partners have noticed had to have a heart to heart with two of them because they felt that i was isolating and not communicating at the end of both of those conversations i left feeling worse about myself instead of better i got told repeatedly i need professional help and theyre right i do but the rest of the conversation was just everything im doing wrong and how it impacts others around me all valid points but i needed support and didnt get that ive been in therapy since i was like 11 im almost 23 after years of different medications and therapies and coping mechanisms its hard to want to keep trying to be better im just so tired of trying its exhausting being mentally ill and being aware of your mental illness and knowing youre insufferable but cant seem to figure out how to stop its exhausting and no one seems to talk about that im just tired,post-pandemic
just one year ago i was actually happy maybe not everyday but i was content and honestly looking forward to the future but today i just sit here typing feeling like there is a hole in my chest that cant be filled nothings changed in my life besides a rough break up but that break up made me take a good look at myself and realize all of my awful flaws i had and i thought that maybe if i found a new gf and fixed my flaws then perhaps the hole could be filled but i know its untrue because a relationship and character development would only distract me from the problems but not fix them yet now everyday is just waking up to either crying or having nothing exciting me even if the day is filled with fun activities the excitement and joy in my life is gone i feel like an outcast who will never truly find connection or love ever again im just this soul doomed to be alone because no one will ever understand or want connect with me on a deeper level the is no point to me and there has never been ive always just been floating down the river of life and its all i hear you have to try new hobbies you have to get more sunlight you have to make yourself more interesting so people want to be your friend why cant someone including myself just accept me for who i am right now no amount of changing or investing in this body of mine is worth it because this life will never be enough for myself or anyone else im so tired of the routine and the bullshit and everyone just telling me how to live everything is just boring now i just want to curl up into a ball and wither away,post-pandemic
understand that the reason you feel the way you do is due too the ego what does ego do to us ego makes us look at all of our flaws and tell us we arent good enough ego creates insecurity because we are always looking to be the best physically we hate seeing people better looking makes us put up barriers too the world because we are scared too show our true self we have gotten to show out true self you think your ego which dictates your thoughts feelings everyday behaviours is you who you are but its not your true self therefore the depression you feel isnt you in your pure self the thoughts that dominate your mind daily with negativity is the result of the ego taking action depression and all of this shit you got going on in your life was not always there there was a point in your life the moment you were born you did not feel the depressive way you feel today the insecure way you feel today the sadness you feel today the amount of mental stress and struggles you face today were not present the moment you came into the world there was a moment where you were simply just existing as a baby so you cannot be depressed in your true natural egoless self that had not developed yet a ego is not developed until life experiences let go of your ego then you will find happiness,post-pandemic
being alone with my thoughts is so awful its painful and difficult and i have absolutely no control i just ruminate on so many painful memories i get trapped in thought spirals affirming all of these awful assessments ive made about myself in the wake of primarily trauma and abuse but theres a lot of elements of truth to them and i cant really avoid thinking about them or that unless i manage to avoid thinking at all i just wake up and do the bare minimum to exist and often times dont even achieve that as i dwell in self neglect and pour every minute o can into video games until im exhausted enough to pass out within minutes of laying down because if i dont then ill lay in bed for hours making myself even more miserable this is so awful and so difficult and it feels impossible to do anything about it i am in hell,post-pandemic
this holiday got my fucked up thinking about all this shit tragic romance i found my first girlfriend on an online chatroom in 2014 while i was at college during my freshman year we started as friends and pen pals i lived in new jersey and she lived in iowa in 2017 she decided to visit me and traveled on a bus for 18 hours across the country to visit me in my hometown and we met for the first time after multiple nights talking endlessly on the phone sending letters and listening to music together on the bedroom floor i never thought i would be capable of finding love especially online i remember that night like yesterday i met her behind a hotel underneath a streetlamp in the shadows we stood there like two silhouettes beneath the moon i didnt tell my family about her arrival and i left my house in the middle of night to go see her and walked across town we kissed and danced in the hotel room listening to smokey robinson and the miracles as i cried on her shoulder we had sex and it was so romantic nothing lustful at all our love was pure and innocent i have to admit she was far more innocent than i was and i felt so blessed to have her in my life she was perfect and i knew she was the one i wanted to marry one day she stayed for three days and then last day she cried and we said goodbye and i gave her poem i wrote and she left on the bus back to iowa that day i cried helplessly and wandered my town because i couldnt believe she was gone fast forward a year later i planned to see her and i traveled to her small hometown in sioux city iowa i remember the time we spent ice skating together and falling on the ground and ignoring everyone else while we were being watched and judged i remember wandering through ghost industrial town at night during the winter and dancing under the stars in a park where there was a statue of virgin mary above us covered in snow we listened to an our favorite album and drove through the winter night and explored ghost town i spent a summer with her swimming in lakes and picnic dates and sleeping in the woods and dancing in our rooms and reading books and writing songs together and watching movies and falling asleep by a tree it was wonderful it all ended unfortunately its tragic her brother died of an alcohol overdose and i had gone through severe mental health issues while being back at home and school etc i wanted to change my life around and move out there with her but it was impossible financially during that time she secretly fell in love with another man who was pen pal who happened to be in prison the last time i saw her i left her apartment in iowa and drove back home to new jersey with my belongings and said goodbye on her doorstep all i know is that she is planning to move out of her town and spend her life with her pen pal she found her true love that hotel we first met in my town has been redecorated and changed so all my memories have gone with it father son and brother ghost story my dad was never actively part of my life he is like a ghost just recently hes attempted to enter my life and he invited me to meet him at a restaurant and shared how my mom tore us apart which is not true he then offered me to go to a music store and look at keyboards together since my dad is a pianist and its probably where i get my love of music from i didnt want a piano or any gifts from him i just wanted his attention and experience a normal father and son relationshipi also got to meet my halfbrother for the first time through my dad due to trauma and estranged relationship the three of us will never be able to come together and be family of brothers my halfbrother showed me a video of my dad playing piano on his phone and made me sob because i wish i could have learned how to play piano like my dad and three of us can bond together he said we would hang out again ive called him and hes never answered his phone for months i asked him to meet me in new york as a restaurant as planned and called me and made up an excuse to ghost me i drove two hours for nothing i stood there restlessly across an empty table and spoke to random strangers and couples and pretended i was waiting for someone special and lied to them about him showing up several months later i was admitted to the hospital and i told him i was suicidal and i called and he answered he never said happy birthday or happy new years or thanksgiving one thanksgiving as i was cutting the spine of a turkey i had a revelation and said to myself the worst thing a father can do to his son is take his spine out i felt that symbolic relationship with the turkey like take his pride or dignity out i feel like my father did that to me and left me hollow and paralyzed that thanksgiving i was with my step dad and his family and i was so depressed because for one time in my life i wanted to spend a thanksgiving with my halfbrother and real dad and feel that connection i never had what was the point of him trying to enter my life weirdly the same thing with my halfbrother all contact stopped for a year what was the point of meeting him at his apartment what was the point of any of this i never heard from them that night when my dad ghosted me at that restaurant i sat at the table surrounded by crowds of happy people couples and families i stormed out of there and tears running down my face i shouted and kicked things in the street while people looked at me like i was crazy and didnt understand why i was so upset i drove all the way back home down the dark pitched highway to my hometown my lost city tales i spent two summers in new york roaming around aimlessly and trying to find friends and develop new connections during these summers i tried a dating app and i wont get into it too heavily but i was ghosted and lied to by two women on the app one particular girl lived in baltimore maryland and ghosted me after several dates and played with my emotions and simply returned to her previous husband i was heartbroken and i took some pills my antipsychotic medication and passed out in my car on the highway during this time i often traveled to new york and i had made one friend there from this record store who involved in this music scene in brooklyn this friend had invited me to go see him perform as a dj at this club and for a while i helped him drive him to his sets with my cars one night i was invited to meet him at this club and he completely ignored me around his friends on the dance floor i was also experiencing a depressive episode at the time wrong time and place of course i stormed out of the club and found a street corner and sat on a milk crate and pile of trash and cried helplessly nobody called me and i had no friend to talk to the last part of this story is that one morning fast forward i decided to go to the city for the weekend to enjoy myself at this club in brooklyn and i wanted to enjoy myself for once and have fun and meet people i arrive there and before i go inside i cry behind my driving seat and drink some alcohol to loosen myself up and calm my anxiety i couldnt stop shivering and a woman and her friends pass my car window and she asked if i was okay i didnt know what to say and so i shook my head and smiled as if everything was okay moments later i am not lying about this shit at all as i am locking my car door and i asked politely for a man in his car for a lighter to light up a cigarette two guys come rushing behind and one guy hits me the back of the head with something idk what it was some object and i was stunned momentarily i heard some screaming and i couldnt remember the rest i thought they were trying to rob me and they ran away,post-pandemic
what i used to feel i used to believe in karma i used to believe in a cosmic unknown force that doled out punishment for your bad deeds and rewarded you for your good ones it was irrational i knew that but i kept that idea held tight in the back of my mind it would dictate how i interpreted events in my life it often brought on shame once i twisted my ankle stepping off of a bus on my way to class i suffered a frature deep in my ankle and was in a cast for a month i attributed that ordeal to bad karma it was punishment for dating my friends exgirlfriend it was what i deserved does this thought sound familiar to anyone with that line of thinking i knew that i should be ashamed of myself every unfortunate occurrence was because of some cosmic judge giving me retribution i felt soaked in guilt i would even feel the need to punish myself i felt like such a bad person i was hurting myself the lesson believing in karma was feeding my depression it was nothing but a rusty filter that corrupted experiences it made setbacks seem like catastrophes i felt judged by others all of the time as if they could see my guilt please let go of that filter things really are not as bad as they seem its all about how you view the world and its your choice even if you dont know it yet,pre-pandemic

in my early 20s id just roll my eyes at the mental health movement it got on my nerves and it still does today at nearly 30 i hate the bandwagon but i fear i might be part of it i dont actually know how to do this so im just going to list everything is this depression x200b i keep trying to go sober alongside a partner who doesnt give a flying fig and happily hits the bottle every night i did it for 28 days recently and had to watch him get drunk all the time with no support at all we dont have sex anymore i have an incredibly high sex drive and we maybe do it once every two or three months every time i mention it he laughs it off but going to bed feeling unwanted and horny is not fun we have an open relationship and i have a friend who i meet for sex every couple of months i think im falling for him and that freaks me out im normally able to just have sex and move on and yet i think we could very easily have an emotional affair speaking of sex its almost as if nothing else matters im not interested in anything anymore i dont care i used to be an inveterate reader and now im lucky if i read a book every couple of months i dont see myself living to old age because i simply cant be bothered i keep thinking i dont need to worry about a pension because ill be dead by then hurrah i ultimately think life is pretty pointless and hate getting out of bed x200b,post-pandemic
when i was attending high school i was top of my class with a dream of attending an ivy league university particularly mit all my teachers were extremely proud of me my parents were excited for my future in education my peers thought highly of me however once the middle of my junior year came i was faced with an overwhelming mental breakdown and fell into a depression i would spend sleepless nights doing schoolwork with already unstable mental health or i would do completely nothing and think i eventually started to think about why i am doing this and realized that i dont like this traditional route im going on nor will the results of it make me happy as i am already depressed doing the things i should like doing at that moment my life lost its meaning near the end of my junior year into senior i stopped taking care of myself developed insomnia due to my obligation to try and keep up with my ap classes and my thoughts relentlessly wandering and slept in all my classes my teachers parents and peers as a result started looking down at me wondering why i became such a disappointment according to my principal when i wanted to lighten my workload this put me in the deepest depression of my life as i felt i failed everyone and destined to be nothing i would resort to cutting myself drinking taking old prescription pills and withhold from eating as a way to punish myself to make this short i decided to make my main way of attaining happiness is music that is my dream everyone is still disappointed in me and it weighs heavy on me i wish it could go away this was more of a medium to vent instead of ask for help as i am not feeling well at the moment thank you if u actually do read this,pre-pandemic

i know that depression or issues related to feeling ill can vary but i want to tell you about something that happened to me i am a boy of almost 18 years old and my life is a constant disappointment the boyfriend who leaves me and says he no longer feels anything for me really bad and below average grades violent parents who have a marriage based solely on children thanks to my birth and my sister is engaged to a bad street boy who deals with drug dealing and has escaped several times from the community for drug addicts and problematic kids where he went thanks to the lawyer paid by my parents my sister also underwent an abortion which i know nothing about since i am not my business i only know because they shouted it one evening while i was sleeping when i asked for psychological help i was laughed at because they said that i created my problems and other things that people say who think that mental health is not important and that depression can be cured by working sometimes i hurt myself by throwing headbutts at home or eating junk food until i burst i was disgusting they recently took me seriously by taking me for a visit to see if i needed a public psychologist i dont know if it exists for you here in italy yes sorry for my terrible english but im italian in fact i downloaded the new silent hill game called short message and its beautiful i wont give any spoilers but after i finished it i wrote a message to a friend of mine who i treated badly because of her mistakes and i told her that from that moment on i wanted to improve i found the strength to get off my ass and start studying im not saying play it and trust me im not paid by konami as a sponsor but if that game can save even just one life then its worth downloading it since its free grazie konami grazie anche a te che hai letto il mio post,post-pandemic

well its most likely the cancer anyways the doctors like to make me feel better by saying theres a chance itll be benign but so far it never has been every test has come back as bad news which just leads to more tests and more uncertainty the pain in my hips has come back and knowing i have a fresh mass in my liver thats already 5cm acrossit freaks me out it wasnt there when i had surgery in the beginning of may which means its spreading and fast i was feeling ok for a couple weeks but the pain is coming back and im scared for the abdominal pain to come backthat was the worst the hurt in my hip is like a constant dull ache thats always bothering me but the pain in my abdomen was like always feeling like puking but never actually puking along with stabbing pain if i moved wrong i dont want that again i even talked to my doctor about going back to work and she said go for it if i feel okay but what if i dont actually feel okay what if it just keeps getting worse will i ever be back to normal will i be able to go back to school in the fall will i be able to finish my degree or will the cancer completely derail the one goal i had finally started to crawl towards i have a biopsy scheduled in 2 weeks and im scared for that my first biopsy didnt give conclusive results that lead to 4 months of waiting for surgery bc no one thought it was serious im terrified of that happening again im just so full of uncertainty and im scared and i feel like im not valid for feeling any of it people have it worse than i do so my brain tells me i dont get to be upset but i am but i dont want to be im conflicted im upset i want to sleep so i dont have to feel forgive the rant but thank you if you read through my woes anyways edit i posted this without much thought last night in the middle of a break down and went right to sleep afterwards i cant believe the amount of support people have shown meim in shock you all are so nice and lovelyit definitely helps the ol psyche when so many people affirm that im allowed to be upset so thank you to everyone who has commented or upvoted these little moments of support help so much sometimes thank you,post-pandemic

it absolutely scares me that my medication simply has no effect i dont feel any different ever it started being bad in early 2020 and i got a diagnosis for depression in late 2021 had 8 months of therapy even double hours and long courses on autogenic training stress management how to deal with emotions journaling etc during this i was put on mirtazapine but nothing improved my doc changed it to sertraline nothing improved i was referred to a psychiatrist who increased my sertraline dose up to 200mg nothing improved got quetiapin for nights where i cant deal with it only took it two times got slightly tired but still no effect on the general sadness and hopelessness etc all i experience is just horrible now beginning of 2024 i was switched to bupropion because even my psychiatrist is in disbelief that nothing worked almost 6 weeks on it again absolutely nothing improved no change whatsoever i feel like i took nothing meanwhile i underwent all sorts of tests breathing gas analysis bloodwork especially tsh to check my tyroid and they cant find any deficiencies of anything off i feel absolutely zero positive effect from any of this and that worries me so much i feel doomed i dont know what to expect i just need to get this off my chest because the thoughts choke me it took me so much effort overcoming mental blockades and cost to reach out for professional advice and so far all help has failed this summer i will use my vacation to seek out a clinic where they can hopefully investigate wtf is up with me it makes no sense i live in a city with only like 10k people not in the us and all the medical practices of psychiatry and even a neurogogist here knows me by now been everywhere no change i feel so lost i wish i could cry forever and just rot away,post-pandemic

i have an extreme fear of making mistakes up to a point where i hurt myself or spend sleepless nights for doing even minor mistakes at the moment its so extreme that i need to show you an example of how farfetched these things are so there was this small music festival today with some bands that match my taste of music but are widely unknown yet and i heard about it like 2 hours before its beginning time regarding the long car ride and the high ticket price im somewhat short on money but it would have still been affordable it was just not enough time to decide and i am currently experiencing one hell of a depressive episode so i stayed at home started doing random things whatever and of course i started looking up the artists at some point one of the bands sounds very similar to kings of leon and i dont know why but in my head theres lately often been this scenario im daydreaming of where i meet the girl of my dreams at some show while kings of leons song pyro is played anyway once it was too late to change my mind my fucking brain immediately started portraying the missed chance since then im tortured by thoughts like man what if this was your only chance to meet such a person theres only this one show the whole year all other shows just play electronic and dance musicthis was your chance some people believe in fate you knowwhatever then i also remember how much ive lost interest in looking for just some girl im just no longer interested in girls who get drunk who go partying who i meet on most of these electronic dance shows since theres no other choice in my area anyway i feel like im seriously in need of a serious mature relationship and i always feel like im hopelessly searching for the one its so weird but 2 years ago i would have never even thought about the idea of having children i just had some relationships but none of them was mature now im 23 and having a serious relationship without all that superficial crap is what im longing for sorry that i switched a bit off the topic and more into dreaming but i feel like im on a hopeless search for something unreachable and for every yet so little chance that i miss i hate myself more and more,pre-pandemic

well look since your life is pretty much worthless to you why dont you try giving it to somebody who can make use of it from volunteering at the local salvation army to teaching english as a second language at the library to joining the peace corps a lot of organizations could use your time especially since youre going to throw it away anyway whats a little inconvenience since youre going to swallow the pills or pull the trigger anyway it certainly wont make any unhappier you can always keep suicide as an option i know its in my tool kit in case i ever need it but i have found that nothing relieves my obsession with myself and my feelings quicker than working with other people who need the help,pre-pandemic

i slept through school today surprise surprise this happens about once a week i just cant keep going on 6 hours every night which is what happens because i have to psych myself up to do schoolwork so i do it late i usually i sleep through the first period or two but it was just the whole thing this time then i had winter guard practice and i was struggling to remember the new drill and work partially because ive had to miss practice and take it slow because im pretty sure i concussed myself but my parents wouldnt get me to a doctor to confirm but also just because i cant remember shit right now not like full amnesia from the concussion just really bad shortterm memory and my parents gave me money to buy show shirts for my competitions 100 and i lost it i forgot to grab it when i got in the car so we had to drive back then i grabbed it i know i put it in a pocket but i dont know which one i checked my 2 pants pockets 2 hoodie pockets 3 jacket pockets and 3 backpack pockets and its just not there it must have fallen out at some point but i retraced my steps and found it nowhere someone probably picked it up at some point i just feel so stupid and worthless like a waste of space i want someone to comfort me and tell me everything will be alright but no one has i guess i dont deserve it i guess im just being selfish feeling sorry for myself update i found the money my parents arent mad im just still kinda frustrated with myself and didnt get the extreme comfort i wanted but its gonna be okay,post-pandemic
from birth i was a calm and quiet child i studied well at parentteacher conferences i was never complained about except for please ask your daughter to smile more that teachers statement made me laugh i really didnt smile much and i wasnt an overly energetic person people called me a walking dead person although i loved to play outside with my friends at 13 i stopped being interested in school and extracurricular activities friends and socializing with them at 14 i started to think about life about how life comes into being and how it disappears i started studying all sorts of theories and it eventually turned a religious teenager into an atheist it was at that age that i first thought about death i would lie there stare at the ceiling and visualize my death at the time i didnt know depression existed yet i thought it was adolescence but who knew that this socalled adolescence would last 6 years now i am 20 years old and i still think about death i think about a lot of things and sometimes blame my depression on overthinking when i walk down the street i always want to lie on the ground in the middle of the street and look up at the sky i come home and stare at the ceiling sometimes crying sometimes just staring i grew up in a full family im well fed i have a place to live i have a job i have family trauma but i cant call it the cause of my depression i dont even know if i can call my problems depression i have not sought professional help im sure it wont help me a year ago i picked myself up and started to lead an active lifestyle do sports travel tried dont overthink i can enjoy myself but its all temporary after my great feat i planned my death i chose a method of suicide that would not harm those around me i wrote a long letter to my loved ones and wrote where they would find my body i even created a 3d model of the coffin but i didnt do it i dont want my loved ones to cry my grandparents are having a stroke and my mom is pregnant my death could take several deaths in its wake i may indeed become selfish but it wont happen in the next few years i am so tired of everything that i want to go to bed and never wake up i feel like everything is rotting inside of me in the end i never found the meaning of life perhaps my whole life will be spent searching for the meaning of life or perhaps i will never find it however i have realized that i have been this way since i was born and i accept myself for who i am,post-pandemic
i dont know why i am writing this maybe i just need to vent i have the privilege of a few good friends to talk to me but something about them or maybe me makes me feel like i am getting sanitized advice and thoughts or something im in a very bizarre situation right now i am moderately successful i run a small professional firm with someone else imagine a small doctors office he is facing expulsion from the profession leaving me to potentially pick up the pieces despite my success i live with my parents to save money because i do not make enough to have decent accommodations and i am afraid to sign a lease because i may be forced to leave at any time it is humiliating the big kicker is that i am a transgender male to female person not many people know it but ive been living this fake male life for so long ive always hated it and always debated what to do about it i know i would have liked to have been a woman far more but the question of what to do to accomplish this has been a horrible debate with myself it is what ive been saving money to fund i hide it from my profession i would be thrown out and ostracized if they knew i bind up my breasts in the morning and pretend to be the man they know i am terrified about what will happen when this all blows up all these people that count on and the potential humiliation horrify me the farther along this path i go the more i feel i am traveling down a horrible path i feel disgusting and filthy ive tried dating i havent really had a real boyfriend or girlfriend in a decade women think i am weird and unnatural and men beg me for clandestine sexual encounters they refuse to actually be seen with me some days i can get by and my day isnt that bad i can do fun things sometimes and be happy sometimes but as time passes i find i get in slumps when i will feel down for days and nothing interests me i am not inspired to work i find no joy in things i used to like i have been struggling to grow and change myself i was using alcohol to cover up these pains before i started transitioning and now i am actually a pretty responsible drinker ive been exercising ive tried antidepressants in the past but i dont know they dont seem to work i just dont feel like i have any future that will ever work i dont think i can ever get out of this and live a normal life both finishing my transition or giving up and going back seem like impossible prospects i just want to sleep all the time i want to crawl in a corner and weep and i dont know what to do other than just post it all somewhere,pre-pandemic
the past 3 years have just been so brutal i 25 f had found out about my husband cheating on me multiple times basically for our entire relationship 2 years ago he has an excuse for it and honestly his excuse felt okay to me in the beginning because its trauma related something had happened to him as a kid but now im just at a loss for everything i dont think i can continue the relationship anymore especially when i told him if he felt that impulse arise to explore himself to just be open with me about it i caught him again but this time he sent a video that we had made together way back to a random person on sc i told him to delete every nude photo and video of me and he said he did i had checked to make sure and they were still there he told me that he had deleted them but he didnt know why they were still there and i made sure that they were gone out of the trash as well permanently deleted we had gone out to the bar with his friends the other night and i got so drunk that when we got back into our neighborhood i just started screaming at him how upset i was and how disgusting i feel and thats exactly how i feel i feel stupid and disgusting idk why i thought that if we just communicated with each other things would get better but theyre not and im just drowning he says hes not mad at me for saying hurtful things but im upset with myself for not just leaving when it first happened its not going to work and that makes me extremely sad i love him so much but i cant stay if im hurting like this,post-pandemic
exercisephysical activity eating healthy spending time in nature finding a hobby are all things that are supposed to be good for your mental health but by definition depression is a problem precisely because it inhibits your inability to function much less do things that are good for you finding a therapist trialling multiple therapists to see which one suits me best or even starting on antidepressants and having to check in with a doctorpsychiatrist every few weeks or having to change medications because one might fuck up my head even more or not even work all takes so much fucking effort that i cant bother to do any of it i went to a counsellor at my university earlier this year and they suggested things like group therapy for my anxiety and volunteering for causes because that can give people a sense of purpose in day to day life and i just didnt know how to tell them that is exactly the problem i have utterly no will to do any of that and thats why im sitting in your office right now and i dont know what anyone can possibly do about me being this way if people with depression were able to so easily do things to help themselves we wouldnt need to classify it as an illness or disorder thats why its so infuriating when we see how even professional mental health advocacy organizations repeat the hackneyed slogans which i cannot understand how they are even still in mass circulation its so irrational and frustrating that im physically able to take ten steps out of the house to just go on a goddamn walk but i have absolutely no mental will to do anything but lie in bed only listening to music is the only action that can be done purely passively with no effort whatsoever but then i just get sad and start spiralling from guilt and i cant stop thinking about how irrational it is even though ive experienced it for so many years im constantly surprising myself from my own incompetence as if i ever expected anything different more than hopelessness i just feel confused as to what im supposed to do when i cant will myself to do anything what even is this anymore edit thank you for all the comments i didnt expect to get any response its hard to describe but i feel very moved that there are people out there that i reached in a small way for a short moment of time,post-pandemic

hi i had a troubled childhood i was raised in a normal family more or less but was always quite poor we were going on holidays my father worked a lot my mother was taking care of me and my sister and we were quite happy so i thought after a while my father lost his job and everything went downhill they both moved abroad to make money and work random jobs that were not really easy they were not getting along and everything was really depressing for them and for us too they divorced and everything went nuts from my father going crazy and drinking later on kicking us from the house to my mother getting another lover and living abroad with him i was in dentistry medical school and struggling to keep my grades up because i had no money to pay for it and i was really depressed after i finished for me it went really bad but i managed to get into residency to have a salary i realized i am not great at dentistry i cant find payed jobs in my country and i dont enjoy it at all during residency i met this student in medical school and i fell in love with him i met his family i met his friends and it all seemed surreal to me it was exactly what i had lost it was exactly what i wanted to be in life and to be surrounded by i couldnt believe my eyes that i came across him a person that had similar qualities and family that i used to have it was like everything was aligned by god not to mention his parents names were the same as mine and their birthdays too it was really strange later on i started talking about myself and my troubles about my lacks and after a while of dating he told me he cant be with me anymore since he is planning to move abroad with his studies and because of our differences we couldnt get along i dont have money and i dont really have that much brain left to be as smart as he is with everything going on in my life i struggle at planning and i struggle with keeping my mind at ease and i have really low income besides the fact that i hate my job i cant focus on normal activities as i used to movies social events friends so it makes sens for him to not want me since i am always depressed i am lost and i want to know does it matter for a guy the income you have does it matter the family you had how can i fix myself,post-pandemic
no one wants to spend time with a negative person no one makes time for someone who is having a hard time no one wants to hear bad things complains issues that others are struggling with none of this is fun so no one truly cares no one puts the effort into a relationship whether is a friendship or more most people are selfish and thats ok people dont own people everyone deals with things and thats ok so im giving up asking for help i dont want to bother anyone anymore i dont want to upset others waste their time im just a nobody a burden who doesnt deserve anything im not even sure why im writing this probably because ive isolated myself completely and i guess subconsciously i might appeal to this as a last attempt at admitting i desperately need help im ignoring loved ones messages from friends everyone and i dont even understand why all i know is that i had enough of feeling lonely enough of this unbearable pain enough of hurting myself because i cant take it anymore,post-pandemic

hi reddit throwaway because its hard for me to talk about this type of stuff i wanted to reach out and see if anyone else had had this type of situation before and if anyone had any advice to offer quick backstory im a 24 year old female with a great job that i love college degrees an attractive sweet boyfriend and a supportive family no one knows that ive been struggling with depression and anxiety on and off for years now my mom knew about it when it first started happening when i was 14 but she hasnt suspected anything for a long time and my boyfriend of 15 years has no idea either its hard to hide it sometimes but i try my best ive also selfharmed on and off for years just every once in a while for a week or so at a time i havent cut for almost a year and a half but ive been feeling the itch very strong lately i can barely stop myself from doing it and my resolve is wearing very thin work stress but primarily relationship stress has been causing my depression to flare back up normally i can handle it without medication but ive been struggling a lot lately ive recently been having issues in my relationship regarding him respecting me and the potential beginnings of verbal abuse during our arguments however he is the best and sweetest boyfriend ive ever had but im feeling so trapped and suffocated right now while im with him i just want to run away im not sure if its something deeper or not but i wanted to know if anyone else has self sabotaged their relationship like this he is trying so hard to make me happy but im so apathetic about the whole thing and im starting to think depression is to blame it is getting to be winter time as well when it starts to raise its ugly head more frequently people keep saying its just a phase in our relationship but i dont feel that way i feel so negatively towards our relationship for almost no reason at all has anyone else ever self sabotaged a great relationship for no reason and do you think your depression was partially to blame tldr great life great boyfriend but find myself self sabotaging the relationship through my unhappiness and apathy has anyone else had experience with something like this,pre-pandemic

i feel like every day i have a passing thought about dying for a long time things were bad i think the first time i wished i had never been born i was maybe 10 decades of abuse and neglect left me feeling empty and numb and just wishing i had never existed i didnt want to die and hurt everyone that cares about me i just wanted to have never existed so that no one would have ever had to deal with me and i would have never had to hurt now i have something good really really good someone who makes me smile every single day and yet i feel those thoughts again with a vengeance why do i have to think these things why cant i just enjoy the good things without suffering i keep wishing that i could just quietly slip away after experiencing this happiness so that i never have to lose it and so i wont have to be alone again ill be fine ive made it this far and i can keep going it just hurts so much sometimes,post-pandemic
i am going to get absolutely hammered for posting this but i cant be the only one who doesnt have much sympathy for the celebrities and superstars that struggle with depression i have had depression since i was 11 and it just makes me sick that some of these people who have everything from money fame power fans and basically anything that they could ever dream of or wish for youre telling me they still cant manage it there comes a certain point where i feel like these people who have been granted every one of there wildest dreams need to sack the fuck up there are tons and tons of people out there who are dealing with financial issues which alone could cripple someones chance of getting help yet you have these people who are at the center of our big meaningless universe and the idol of so many eyes that literally have access to all the possible resources in the world and you are trying to tell me that i should feel the tiniest bit of compassion for one of these spoiled fucks none here ill save mine for the people who need it,pre-pandemic

tldr my friend attempted and it was partially my fault to give some context about our relationship me 24m and her 23f met on a dating app like a month ago we have been on a few dates and talk all the time over the past week or so she started distancing herself so i asked her why and she said it is because of anxiety and she is scared to get hurt again i told her thats fine and i will be here to support her whether we stay just friends or it becomes romantic fast forward a few days we were supposed go to dinner together and she eats dairy lactose intolerant for lunch and so we end up cancelling plans i got frustrated and said she could have just said she didnt want to go not to do this kind of crap to make an excuse we argue for a bit about it the next day she says that she tried to kill her self and that she was sad she woke up in the morning apparently she had gone to her friends for help about me and they got nasty at her so now she was in a position where she lost all of her friends and was in a really dark place which is why she did it i feel like its my fault for starting this chain reaction and i feel horrible and it breaks my heart that i couldnt be there for her when she needed someone the most we have talked a little since this event and she confirmed it was partially because of me but i dont know the right things to say to show im here for her,post-pandemic
you really have to be careful with what you say around coworkers friends and family if youre not always a ray of sunshine you become the negative depressed person who is no fun to be around at the end of the day no one really gives a shit about what youre dealing with if youre not being positive and smiling no matter the reason they have a problem with you i wish there wasnt a constant pressure to be happy and outgoing it is exhausting to hear comments about your demeanor,pre-pandemic

first of all i have hesitated for a long time just to write everything that burdens me but maybe it helps just to get rid of everything once about me 31 years old i am psychologically completely broken and physically unfortunately also very lediert my life has just gone wrong from the beginning and sometimes i wonder if some people are just lucky and others are not i grew up in an already broken family my mother was married 3x and divorced 3x i am the child of the second husband i can remember almost all the incidents of my childhood which makes it worse for me one of the first memories i have about 35 years my father went after my mother with a knife and even stabbed through a door with a knife he was then thrown out by my grandparents and i saw him only once a short time later he was an alcoholic all his life and did not even try to contact me even when my exwife met him by chance in the hospital 10 years ago and gave him my cell phone number without my knowledge in the meantime he passed away about 2 months ago and i knew nothing about him except that he was an alcoholic after he was no longer there my mother had quickly met someone new my stepfather he was 8 years younger than my mother unfortunately he was also very aggressive as a chain smoker he was very quickly annoyed when he had no more cigarettes and has quickly become with things around him it also did not take long and my mother and he have often and loudly quarreled often thrown on dishes on the walls he became unfortunately also now and then handgreiflich and has beaten me and my brother whereby my brother was rather his favorite since he was older and could make more with him after we have moved several times we lived in a townhouse only then it did not take long that my mother and my stepfather have also divorced my stepfather had cheated on my mother for a long time with my cousin yes it does not get better after the separation my stepfather has emptied the joint account and has filed for bankruptcy because no one could keep the house alone my mother also had to file for bankruptcy shortly after that we moved of course unfortunately my mother lost her job 3 years later and has never found a fulltime job again and lives since then on social benefits with my brother child of my first husband and 3 years older than me i never had a really good relationship mostly he didnt want to have anything to do with me and we generally did less together he was also not at the same school as me he was never very educated unfortunately he also moved out quite early because he did not get along with our mother at all and even resented that she separated from our stepfather because he got along with him he then moved to another cousin of ours until he was 18 and even had contact with our stepfather generally he was always very strange he watched our parents having sex or generally our mother taking a shower and played with himself while doing so he is also said to have had sex with our cousin according to a friend of his probably several times and has often set fire with a friend together he somehow had a kind of mother complex and for many years always looked for much older women who often also had children but usually it did not last very long when it was over he often set a fire somewhere what i knew about afterwards was his own car a garden shed a meadow and finally an attic of an apartment building whereupon he was arrested and sentenced however only on probation his last partner was 11 years older than him with whom he actually held out for 6 years only a short time later he had a partner 11 years younger a complete change of heart which was then suddenly pregnant immediately after the first child a few weeks later she was pregnant again however i had in the people 10 years very very rarely contact with my brother and we have seen us actually only when our grandparents died who have reached a proud age 92 and 94 in general i have also completely broken off contact in the meantime because after several attempts on my part no normal relationship can develop between us i can not even have a reasonable conversation with him because you just notice he seems to be very stupid i just can not express it differently about me i also made a lot of mistakes in life unfortunately for me i almost didnt focus on my schooling and did almost nothing in class my mom didnt care what i did or didnt do anyway she never showed up for a parentteacher conference either i wanted to earn money as fast as possible and learned the next best thing and ended up in the camp my goal though was to become a soldier and joined the army after my training unfortunately i got a slipped disc there and dropped out 2 years later then i ended up in a larger company where i had worked until today i started drinking myself very early 15 years because i myself had a very bad environment the city i lived in generally had high unemployment and there was a lot of drug dealing also through my education i drank almost every day after work and it was later to the point that i completely shut down 4 times a week and had a blackout several times this was no better in the armed forces was able to make the leap in my mid 20s though and quit i dont even drink beer in between anymore because i just dont feel like it i also take my other drugs although i sometimes wonder if maybe i should or smoke either i have always tried in my life to escape into some relationships because i could not be alone my first relationship lasted 5 years circa and i was married myself and had to divorce and have a son my exwife however always wanted to make life difficult for me and i got deeply into debt because of her since she among other things never completed an education just like that she quit her jobs and i was the sole breadwinner and often signed contracts and did not pay them whereupon i received debt collection letters i had to declare insolvency at some point because we also had a joint loan running i had also met a new woman half a year later and moved only my exwife really sabotaged this relationship and it didnt last long also because i wanted to see my son regularly i then decided to stay alone for 2 years but lived near my exwife again because of my son when i met my current partner i decided to finally live my own life and not always be there for others and moved a little further away got another wonderful daughter and everything looked like it was going uphill also this time my exwife has tried to make our life hell which led to the fact that i have quarreled with my partner very often and now also have no contact with my son for a year my job has also deteriorated more and more because the company was bought up 3x and changed the work climate has made me more and more broken and i had a second herniated disc in addition i was then admitted to a day clinic because i was also psychologically at the end after a few months there i was diagnosed with trauma therapy and was also diagnosed with bipolar narcism i discontinued this therapy a year later because it didnt help me at all in the meantime however i have screwed everything up i had to give up my job for health reasons although i have a gdb of 30 and was equalized i am also about to lose my partner because there is more and more crisis between us i really dont have anyone in my life anymore i have moved 13 times in my life in general and have lost a lot of contacts and friends i also lost some contacts because of my exwife i generally only have contact with some friends i met online or old work colleagues i also see my mother about 12 times a year but i dont care if i see her at all or not but she understandably wants contact with her grandchildren i must also say to myself i was a very difficult personality from a certain point and also my friends and partners had to learn to deal with it i always had the urge to somehow talk nonsense and can hardly ever stay serious about anything even when i write this text you could subordinate it under joke addiction or moria i also have a very low frustration threshold and go crazy quickly if i just drop something unfortunately im also very forgetful and often dont know what im supposed to do several times a day i probably owe that to the alcohol all in all due to narcism i often have the impression of being emotionally dead i cry in the rarest situation at all even if sad videos still carry me away i can hardly show empathy towards others i also really dont care about much and i notice it more and more that i really dont care about anything that happens apart from my children i have never really had the feeling of being happy in general almost nothing good has ever happened to me conclusion so now i wonder does it even make sense for me to exist i am insolvent i have a divorce behind me my partner will leave me soon i have no job anymore no friends and probably soon no more apartment since i then the insolvent also no new apartment more find edit first of all thank you all you have really touched my heart even if it is hard for me to admit something like that you dont have to worry about me doing anything to myself i dont want my children to have a horrible childhood like me besides for your love you are really great and i understood that there are things in life worth living for of course i will also seek professional help it is not very easy to get appointments here but i will keep at it and not give up i know i cant change my past but i can change my future my inbox has exploded with messages and i have already replied to some even if i wanted to i probably wont manage to reply to every single one thanks again you are great and stop pls giving me reward save your money,post-pandemic

there is only one therapy group in my city that i can afford actually i cant even afford them until i get a job but its them or nothing and really given that ive been trying unsuccessfully to find a job any job for the last three years i know its never going to happen but its pretend i have hope or commit suicide by cop problem is the therapist actually a psychiatristpsychologist mdphd and everything is an idiot who says and does stupid hurtful things out of spite like lying to me about medication sideeffects or even what medication hes prescribing me no doc antipsychotics are not the same as antidepressants i dont care where you got your degree from like grinning and asking did that make you feel better after i had a small breakdown in his office like talking about his family for 30 minutes out of a 45minute session while i was sobbing uncontrollably and not so much as offering me a tissue from the fresh box of tissues sitting next to him and throwing the box at my head when i asked for one like calling me a racist for ranting about my old bosss obnoxious mother who happens to be indian and who my old boss gave an office and salary despite her having no official duties or doing anything else all day but call the white women fat ugly whores and separate incident an honesttogod panic attack i had while on the phone with customer service about some unauthorized charges on my phone bill when i couldnt understand the representatives accent which i assume was indian or pakistani his actual words watch it or were through here today do you understand me like clicking his teeth shaking his head and saying well im impressed youve managed to stay so fat then when i explained to him that some weeks ive had to choose between therapy sessions with him and eating every day like bragging about how he rented a lakefront house for 3000 per day while knowing that i have not had work in three years like repeating every word i said during another breakdown in his office as in youre right you havent had an interview in eight months and cant even get a job bagging groceries okay you dont have any money and cant afford to keep the lights on and that makes you a bad person yes and so on no commentary no sympathy no advice just repeating every work i said right back at me like picking up the phone and waving it in my face as he slowly dialed 9 1 and 1 again all the while lecturing me on how i needed to control myself because it was so easy to get hysterical white women like me committed involuntarily i had broken down and started slapping myself after he repeated every thing id said right back at me and this was his enlightened response and worst of all as i discovered today flagging my file at the clinic so that i cant see any doctor therapist or counselor at the clinic but him i tried calling another psychiatrist just so i could at least get medicine that could actually work on me but no dice anything i want or need at the clinic now has to go through him i cant appeal to anyone at the clinic because he is a tenured professor at the local medical school and a senior partner in the clinic i did file complaints with his school and my state medical board but i know they wont do anything because hes only metaphorically fucked me i keep telling myself something is better than nothing and i believe it less and less each time if and when i quit coming to therapy i dont know what i will do or what i can do i know what i should do but i dont want to traumatize some innocent cop just yet,pre-pandemic

i am a woman aged 33 been having depressive episodes since 2017 i notice i fall into relationships and once i am out of relationships i get into depression this pattern has been happening since 2017 recently came out of a situationship which i shouldnt have gone for at the first place which i knew would hurt myself more i realise my world is crumbling again but at this point in my life i feel extremely lonely and not having anyone to talk to i am tired of being sad and waking up and crying everyday before i start my work all i want is one positive thought in between something positive i have no love in me i am not able to love the people who love me i am not able to give anything or bring anything to the table i am just surviving with the hood that i wont wake up the next day i want to get out of this feeling and want to be able to live one day just like normal people without depression i realise how weak my heart is and i have been just crying most of the days in the morning,post-pandemic

you dont want a girlfriend you want to feel like people genuinely care about you wanting a girlfriend is just that desire mixed with your innate need for romancelovesexgrills another way you might have reasoned is if people treat you like this normally then a girlfriend would treat you in a better way ie how a friend would treat you so basically you dont want a girlfriend you want friends,pre-pandemic

some time ago i told a woman i love you unconditionally she replied unconditional love does not exist i whispered back watch me she soon broke up with me partly because as many girls have done in the past she felt insufficient about herself in the face of someone who possesses more empathy than her sorry not sorry that is simply a fact not a delusion on my part some of them have straight up admitted this to me unconditional love did not exist in her worldbecause deep down she believed that she was incapable of loving anyone unconditionally and she was projecting that alleged inability onto the rest of the world my father was a diagnosable sociopath my grandfather partially recognized this as soon as he observed the behavior of my 5yearold father i recognized it when reflecting back about how my father abused me physically mentally emotionally and sexually how could someone do the things he did to his own son a lack of empathy the capacity to understand or feel what another person is experiencing certainly helps and a denial of love and an embracing of selfishness also helps being raised by a diagnosable sociopathpsychopath someone who lacks empathy i was attracted to and attracted other sociopaths in my relationships my very first girlfriend admitted to me i hate it when you cry about the suffering of others because when you talk about how you feel bad for them and how they are hurting it makes me feel bad about myself because i feel nothing in that moment i felt both scared of her but i also admired her brutal honesty i still love her despite how she hurt and cheated on me by the way after intense years of therapy something every single one of you would benefit greatly from but most of you are too proud to recognize that just as you go to a doctor for physical health it is only common sense to go to a doctor for a mental health checkup i have now gotten over my tendency to be attracted to and attract sociopathspsychopaths so how can i help you with your depression anxiety and pain youve been hurt people have hurt you people are not simply dichotomously separated into two categories of empaths or sociopaths they are on a spectrum everyone has varying degrees of empathy additionally wherever one lies on the spectrum of empathy does not determine how they will treat others people do have free wills and the ability to make choices sorry intellectual elites who believe it is all an illusion i understand where you are coming from but you are wrong an empathetic person can live a bad life and a sociopath can probably live a good life you need to accept the hurt that has happened to you you need to seek professional help to work through it you need to find a counselor who isnt lazy and just prescribes pills in order to make money and turn you into a safe zombie im not saying all medication is bunk take your meds you need to accept others and then establish boundaries that no one can cross in order to protect yourself you need to accept yourself you need to love yourself you will never find true love or accept true love until you can first love yourself it will never happen until you realize this fact and act upon it you are selfish you are a social creature like an ant you are supposed to work for the good of the colony and your fellow humans and all life on earth as long as you are selfish you will suffer from depression anxiety and pain and your pills will not save you some time ago i told a woman i love you unconditionally she replied unconditional love does not exist i almost believed her but i no longer have any doubt instead i have faith i have faith in myself i have faith in jesus whatever jesus means to you even if you are an atheist and most of all no matter how much or how little empathy you possess i have faith in you start choosing love and you will become free from your suffering,pre-pandemic

when i think back to my teenage years which were possibly my most suicidal it seems like all i really wanted was rest fantasies like being diagnosed with some fatal illness were so appealing because id have that period of dying to just stop and rest and not have to care about all my obligations i just needed some fucking relief from all the pressure and pain and loneliness and anger another common fantasy of mine at that age was being able to stop time i remember telling my brother about this and being shocked it had no appeal to him at all he was like why that would be so boring youd just be by yourself the whole time i was like ya thats the whole appeal unlimited time by myself i dont see death this way anymore though i dont think its an opportunity for rest i dont think rest exists outside of our mortal experience even i think youre either just dead without the consciousness to feel anything or youre into some other existence where nothing from your time on earth applies ill rest when im dead to me not true if you need rest take it on earth cuz you wont get it anywhere else,post-pandemic
im sorry but moms fucking suck ass when it comes to mental health thats all my mom does with all the problems i face in life she always downplays them because theres worse than that being a teenager and having mental health issues is so complicated because ultimately you have to pass through your parents when it comes to that kind of stuff what am i supposed to do man,post-pandemic
i feel like a deer caught in the headlights completely lost and confused its as if im a bewildered buck trying to navigate the concrete road of life the lush green grass and thriving forests of possibilities taunt me tempting me to taste the fruits of life but just as i gather the courage to cross i catch a glimpse of a semitruck racing towards me with blinding lights its cargo carries anxiety depression and hopelessness weighing down the suspension of the trailer im paralyzed unable to move in time i no longer recognize myself i remember a time when i was happy before i joined the army i had friends a social life and dreams for the future unfortunately everything changed after i took that oath ive blocked out so many memories as they cut the deepest im terrified of experiencing happiness it feels like a tornado overwhelming and powerful but once its gone all that remains is destruction death and shattered foundations i no longer feel human i turned 27 last month an age where most people have a spouse children a career a family friends aspirations and a social life but these things no longer interest me when i look around all i see is evil hatred and sorrow who would want to invest in this hellish existence i know some argue that there is still good in the world but i believe that perception is reality in todays age and perception is often manipulated just like how a seemingly perfect couple may be struggling with infidelity or how some charities only allocate a small percentage of their funds to their mission i suppose ive lost all my optimism whats the point of anything if the outcome is always the same life is short and whatever comes after is eternal ive lost interest in my hobbies at an alarming rate i used to escape reality by listening to music or playing video games but even those no longer bring me solace i cant bring myself to talk to my family because i feel ashamed its as if it would have been better if i had never existed in the first place im trying my hardest to live the most nonexistent life possible my fear of abandonment prevents me from forming and maintaining friendships on top of that i think ive developed cherophobia social anxiety keeps me trapped inside my apartment unable to leave i often find myself frozen on the sofa staring at the door terrified at the thought of visitors whenever someone knocks it feels like my heart is about to explode and i immediately retreat to the bathroom for hours even going grocery shopping becomes a procrastination game for me i despise being around people and only venture out when absolutely necessary usually at night i dont feel suicidal but i genuinely wish i had never existed ive been fighting to be normal for years and im exhausted im completely worn out everything feels so draining ive given up on life and cant find a reason to keep trying all i can do now is eat sleep take my medication and count the days im just a deer stuck on the highway just a update on my state of mind bobby,post-pandemic
i think thats the first time i feel real love for a person ive been for a week to sharm el sheikh in a holiday village and met this girl that works there shes 20 now nothing wrong with it but i am 14 its not like id say yeah id bang her i feel like that if she wouldve asked me to wait four years for her i wouldve said yes now i am back home and i feel empty and sad without her no girl of my age or either other girl can fill the hole she left in my heart she lives around 12 hours of car and 2 of airplane from me but the fact shes 20 doesnt affect me anyhow id marry her id steal my dads car just to see her one more time,pre-pandemic

so i just wanted to share how the last month of my exercise as medicine journey has been going im a person who is not helped much by meds after being on them for about 20 years i walked 16 miles again yesterday and i really get so much self esteem and relief from depression and anxiety from these days when i accomplish herculean efforts but what i realized is that its much much more important for me to build consistency i fell into a pattern for a little while where i would walk really far one day then take two days off then walk again then miss another two days the result was that i fell back into a deep depression with suicidal ideation i worked back up to more consistent walking without the two day gaps and found that i can remain stable for the most part as long as i achieve consistency for me right now that is 34 days of walking sessions per week with no more than one day off in between walking sessions but my goal is to maintain a consistent 56 day a week walking routine i average 10 miles of walking each time i walk its not normal at all for 2 days off to bring me back to a space of near suicidal ideation and so i followed through with adding latuda to my meds as an adjunct to lexapro i also take 1 mg of klonopin daily my hope is that the latuda as an adjunct will balance my chemistry more and give me the extra relief from depression and anxiety i need to remain stable even if i dont work out for a couple of days i should be able to miss a couple days without feeling like im close to a hospitalization so im hopeful that this new strategy will improve my situation the exercise is still working miracles though the 16 miles the other day pulled me out of the hole completely today i did 8 miles i lost 12 pounds in the past 3 weeks also which is great for me because it means my metabolism has finally recovered from the depakote i discontinued a few months ago it was hard to work so hard and lose no weight for a long time but i stuck with it and now im over that hump my self esteem and wellness overall continues to transform from exercise and im still in awe of how much it is helping the added benefit of dropping some weight is that i look better which also helps me to feel better ive been on jenny craig for three weeks now also which no doubt is why i lost 12 pounds it jump started my metabolism its expensive but even when i go off it which will be soon because i cant afford to stay on it i learned some things that i can carry over that are increasing my wellness so im excited that when i let go of the jenny craig these strategies can stay with me the things that are most helpful that i can continue to do without jenny craig are 1 eat a ton of non starchy vegetables and non starchy fruits during the day im actually allowed to have unlimited non starchy vegetables and im finding that green leafy vegetables increases my energy a lot 2 drinking 64 oz of water a day this is just making everything about my body work better without it i notice i cant drop weight no matter how hard i work the water is just this magic ingredient that makes everything else im doing effective my skin is getting better also 3 eating 5 small meals a day instead of 3 my increased positive outlook also prompted me to go through my text threads and delete any that cause me anxiety to glance at as i use my phone i also got rid of old contacts for people i am no longer in touch with who i have negative associations with the exercise decreases the depression and anxiety enough to change my outlook enough so that these ideas about cutting out negativity occur to me whereas before they would not occur to me at all when i fell back into deep depression from taking too many days off from exercising i picked up the habit of staying online for too many hours a day again im cutting down on my hours online again now that im feeling much better the vitamins i started taking have to do with another condition i have chronic daily migraine my neurologist prescribed 100 mg of riboflavin 4x per day and 400 mg of magnesium once a day these vitamins are decreasing the frequency and intensity of my migraines which is great because all the drugs they tried to give me slow down my metabolism and work against my fitness goals ive been walking at night and i just find it so freeing for some reason i think its because im an adult who lives with my retired parents who are always home so this gives me much needed time away from my family finally i have been walking on the beach right next to the coastline and the ocean has been sucking the negativity right out of me i literally get a sensation that the craziness and negativity is being pulled out of me as the waves recede back into the ocean and the pain in my head seems like its getting sucked out of me too so thats how its been going and i just wanted to share this with anyone who might be struggling and finding that their meds are not enough and that relying on meds alone has been failing them as it was me i also found this amazing subreddit its a very supportive subreddit about building positive habits check it out i think theyre onto something over there xoxo,pre-pandemic
i have gone through the same stages so many times i am beyond exhausted i feel passively suicidal and wish that someone would shoot me or id die in an accident or something being beset by these thoughts exhausts me to the point i feel numb and i dissociate from myself and whatever is happening around me i fall into a state of being unproductive and become listless at this point everything is a chore including basic things like brushing my teeth doing my laundry or going to the grocery i have to then put all of these tasks on my habit tracker to create an incentive to do all of these things and manufacture motivation by seeing the streak that i have maintained i somehow then muster the energy over the span of weeks to reach a functional state where i am fairly productive then automatically or by virtue of some trigger my passively suicidal thought become intense i become exhausted and the cycle repeats i have been living through this hell for 2 years now and i dont know how many more of these cycles i have left in my the sheer mechanical nature of this makes me dejected and i induces a feeling of helplessness i hate this,post-pandemic
why has god always hated me so bad literally my life has sucked since birth i have never had the beautiful life i watch others live i dont even do the sinful things they do and never have yet if i slip just a little i get full punishment or not slip at all and still feel like im being beaten down im not even allowed to be happy when im just done and try to catch someone else in their abusive behavior something always fails and i appear as the bad person and all i have to do is just be standing here i dont get it i really think im not even supposed to be alive is this life just a cruel joke,post-pandemic
like its harder for my brain to work like im in the middle of a fog i make stupid mistakes at work i wonder if im mentally handicapped i have thoughts of what if im no longer mentally able to do my job that scares me edit finally got back here and wow did this take off i went through every last one of your comments im in a brain fog even as i write this so i dont have the right words but thank you for all your stories support advice information and so much more as much in pain as i am right now i am so grateful because until now i was missing a huge understanding of my condition a doctor once told me i was living in a dark room well part of that dark room was not understanding the mental handicaps and possible permanent loss of function that go along with this disease so i hope you have had aha moments about your condition too so that we can all be on the way to recovery like some have fortunately accomplished,post-pandemic
there are genes for aggression tribalism and greed three things that have plauged our entire species from our apelike days babies are inherently racist they trust people like look like them and usually show signs of discomfort and nervousness around people of other races a study reported we are literally bad from birth the only way to make a better society is to genetically remove those genes out of the gene pool which is possible scientists have done it before in other animals but nobody would agree to have it being done to humans cause of ethical reasons so therefore look forward to racism sexism homophobia capitalism war violence rape greed and more never ending something cant end if we are repeatedly passing those genes down to our offspring only way itll end is if we go extinct,post-pandemic

im supposed to be female but you can hardly tell and using that term would be disrespectful to actual women im morbidly obese and my folds are growing some greenish slime with an intensely putrid odor im 24 but i look mid 30s because of my skin ive smoked since 12 and been very unhealthy and ridden with acne so my skin is covered in stretchmarks wrinkles and scars all at once i also cut like some petty little emo my boobs are sagging a bit below my navel which in turn sags into my crotch ive had bulimia since early teens my teeth are destroyed by stomach acid some needed to be removed and my mouth has gaping holes now the rest lack any enamel and are deep yellow with black decay spots all over them being so obese i fucked up my hormones and started growing a thin mustache and a couple of long dark chin hairs my heart is failing and im probably entering the beetus land i constantly fart because im so bloated from the shit i eat i have never kept a job for longer than a month because i keep screwing things up then lying about it as im too cowardly to admit my fault im being an asshole to people and no one likes me i abandoned my own kid because i didnt give a shit about him i still dont i would probably end up abusing him too if my mom didnt take him from me i used my husband for fetching me food and caring for me never giving anything in return as soon as we had slight financial difficulties and he wasnt fulfilling his role of making my life comfortable i dumped him when he needed me most he is still struggling 3 years later saying he will wait forever for me to take him back i ignore him so i dont have to feel bad for a moment im too lazy and embarrassed to go ask for benefits so i leech money from my poor old retired parents instead i tell them that i did ask but was denied when i had a dog i would often spend his dog food money on my binges then feed him my vomit so he doesnt starve to death then he got bitten by another dog and died of untreated infection because i didnt take him to the vet i deserve what ive become i deserve every single bit of this suffering i shouldnt even be killed i should be left to rot in my own shit until it starts spilling over the brim of my mouth hole and i slowly suffocate in agony,pre-pandemic
not sure if this is the right subreddit to post this but im going to anyway open to any feedback ideas etc for a while now id guess since 2020 ive been dealing with this constant numb feeling it impacts every aspect of my life i cant look forward to things anymore i dont try new hobbies or do things for fun and it impacts my motivation to achieve things when it comes to my job i wouldnt say im sad im just numb and generally dont feel anything at all i do experience anxiety a lot i feel like this week its really come to a head and i just dont know what to do anymore on paper i have a great life that a lot of people would kill for i have a great girlfriend a lot of friends and a good family situation i dont say that to brag im extremely lucky and grateful i just have no ability to focus and put effort into making my life better after work i just go to bed and lie down and scroll i find i cant even pay attention to tv and movies two things i love i should be happy and thriving but the truth is im not im an empty hollow shell who puts on a brave person in public ive tried various things since this all started antianxiety meds and antidepressants but i felt they just exacerbated my numbness and didnt address the underlying issue whatever that may be i drink socially and use pot moderately but other than that no substance issues i dont know what im looking for by posting this i just probably know some people here can relate essentially its like the fuckin regularness of everyday life is too hard for me and i dont know what to do,post-pandemic

i dont really see it getting better either my entire life is filled with abandonment my dad is my friend not my dad he cant be a dad when it comes to deaths in the family he would leave me a child to figure out coping and mourning by myself and expected me to be his parent my interactions with my mom were either her yelling at me or me conforming to her rules of being quiet and doing nothing no silliness allowed no talking too much and no crying if she yelled at me and i didnt understand why and i cried id get yelled at more and forced to stop crying no escape my classmates would single me out and seclude me and teachers never remembered my name when i eventually told my parents about the bullying i experienced they said they didnt know i was being bullied as a kid and didnt notice how depressed i was nobody is paying attention nobody ever has my friends are superficial my mom cuts our conversations short everyone has just had way too much of me and i havent even done anything i am truly repeatedly a fucking burden i cant think of one genuine person in my life,post-pandemic
i dont know where to post should i post to rdepression should i post rmentalhealth should i post to roffmychest should i post to rselfharm i dont know so many people here advised me to get a therapist i did that so many people advised me to get back on my medication i did that but no one on any of the subreddits is offering my any support why are we a community if we dont offer support my family never supported me when i was broke and struggling im starting to find work they are congratulating me like nothing ever happened i want to be so angry but i cant because so many people dont have family i should be blessed but im still hurt i dont know which subreddit is the best for me im talking with someone but i cant talk with them all the time so i came here for advice how do i let go of the past how do i forgive my family who hurt me when i was struggling and broke,post-pandemic
i read a lot of posts on here of people struggling with daily debilitating depression that plagues every aspect of their lives making it difficult to do small things like even take a shower i feel that i am on the opposite side of the spectrum and wanted to share that it is equally as horrible from an outsiders perspective i appear to be a very happy and stable individual i have a financially secure job and i go to work every day and not only try my best but actively try to get along with others and make people laugh every day my coworkers like me and some look up to me no one would think i have any problems at all however i feel like i am hidden behind a veil and when i come home from work and when i am in the privacy of my home i am in such crippling depression i have such terrible episodes of sadness i hate myself i overanalyze everything stupid i do or say throughout the day and i replay it in my mind constantly and belittle myself i dont feel proud of myself for any of my accomplishments and genuinely dont know why anyone even likes me and yet i still get up every day live this routine and put on a facade like i am okay it feels like i am living a double life that i cannot escape,pre-pandemic

hi i was diagnosed with depression last year and went on fluoxetineprozac for awhile but i stopped eating my medication because i thought i was gettingfeeling better as my night terrors had stopped i used to always cry in my sleep and my mood was generally feeling better recently ive developed insomnia i have a really hard time falling asleep at night which causes me to sleep a lot during the day i could feel really exhausted or had a long day but i still wouldnt be able to sleep on top of that im a shift worker so i do both day and nights not sure if its due to my job although ive been at this job for 5 years already or if my depression is creeping up on me i dont feel suicidal but that doesnt mean i cant have depression i have trouble concentrating on tasks too and i have a short temper am irritable i cant afford a therapist and im just frustrated,post-pandemic
this is very long but i am so depressed prior to surgery i considered myself to be pretty and even strangers would compliment me on my beauty i am an extremely vain person and whenever something went wrong in my life i would always think at least im still pretty before surgery i would spend hours just looking at myself in the mirror and was obsessed with my appearance i had rhinoplasty to remove a small dorsal hump on the side of my nose i told the surgeon i liked the rest of my nose and did not want it to change from the front profile he recommended a small chin implant to better balance my facial asthetics with the new nose i agreed to it stupidly even though i dont even have a receded chin i think he was trying to get more money from me i also asked him will this change my face from the front to which he replied no only the side it has been 3 months since the surgery and i am honestly suicidal everyone has told me or hinted that i look worse from before and i literally cant even look in the mirror at all i never go outside and i am even taking a semester of school because i feel deformed the surgeon ruined my face and ruined my beauty i feel heartbroken and distraught i will never get my looks back i didnt even have a large nose but the surgeon rotated the tip up and made it even smaller it looks awful especially when i smile and changed my whole face for the worst people keep thinking im in high school now the small upturned nose gave me a childish cutesy appearance that has ruined my entire face before i looked older and would get hit on multiple times when id go outside even just to the supermarket now im lucky if it happens once every few days the chin implant looks seriously fucked up and lengthened my chin so much from the front it looks horrible it also changed my smile completely and made my face look wider i just found out that the material the surgeon used moulds into your own bone and nerves so it is very difficult to remove and odds are that i will never get my old chin and smile back this was the most devastating thing to hear other surgeons tell me i will never have my old nose back i seriously have never been depressed or suicidal in my life but now all i think about is killing myself it is the only solution i can think of since i cant live my life with this ugly face i cant go outside and when i do i literally feel like a monster i feel like this would be easier to handle if i was slightly less attractive than before surgery but seriously i went from feeling beautiful and feeling pretty to feeling like a hideous monster i know its not all in my head since multiple people have told me i look worse than before and i can see the dramatic difference in pictures my days are spent researching revision surgeons who can hopefully restore my old face and constantly crying over my lost beauty now i will have to pay 20000 for a revision to have a rockhard nose made up of rib cartilage and fake pieces which will never look as good as my original nose i feel like god is punishing me for my selfabsorption vanity and pursuit of perfection i really dont know what i did to deserve this i wouldnt wish this on my worst enemy i seriously seriously will kill myself if the revision surgery cant give me close to my old face back my life has literally been ruined i never thought cosmetic surgery which i paid thousands of dollars for would make me ugly i loved my face from the front profile before and now i wake up every morning petrified to look in the mirror not only is my beauty gone but so is my sense of identity i no longer recognize my own face in the mirror and everything i loved about it is gone i have to live with this mistake for the rest of my life which i honestly cant handle i feeling overwhelming saddness and regret every time i pass by a mirror i cant even use the bathroom without breaking down into tears when i catch a glimpse of my fucked up face in the mirror i have never felt so hopeless in my entire life what makes things worse is that family and friends tell me youre ruining everyone elses lives you look fine when i cry and constantly complain about my nose but i dont feel fine i feel hideous and my parents say its hard to have sympathy because i did this to myself i hate them for saying this i already blame my stupidity naivety and vanity i already blame myself enough i dont need them telling me this is my fault as well its not like i wanted the surgeon to ruin my face i just wanted a small bump gone off the side of my nose and now my entire face has been destroyed only those who have experienced something similar can truly understand how it feels to look in the mirror and no longer recognize your face but instead see a ugly monster staring back at you sorry this is so long but i have nothing else to do except sit on my laptop all day since this surgery happened i never even knew what reddit was until a month ago to anyone considering any cosmetic surgery dont do it unless you absolutely hate your current nose or looks i wouldnt wish this pain on anyone i know that i will kill myself if i cant get similar to my previous looks back i really really see no other option since i cant live with this face i have now,pre-pandemic
the girl i am still obsessed with said she wasnt interested in a boyfriend and has to focus on school i am trying to just not take it personally and move on but i am super depressed about it because i still want her more than anything i still fantasize about having her love and being happy and fulfilled im a goodlooking guy so i cant figure out why she doesnt want me im so stubborn that i cant simply take that for an answer though i feel like she wants me but something is stopping her but she likes me too im not sure if i should keep trying with her or if i should just try to forget about her and start hitting up other girls sadly even if i had a girl that was really into me and loved me i wouldnt be happy because i really really want her more than anybody ive ever wanted before any other girl would just be a substitute to make me feel better what am i to do should i wait it out until she no longer lives with her dad because that could very well be the issue or should i go for some other girl i dont really like to feel better,pre-pandemic
im a high school sophomore female and have been feeling extremely burnt out and possibly depressed i dont have any friends to tell and dont want my parents knowing for multiple reasons i dont want the school counselors knowing because i dont want this to be a big deal and i dont trust most of the adults at my school my english teacher is really hard yet a passionate person 43 male and although he seems intimidating on the outside hes actually really empathetic and warm hearted he knows my family and me a little more personally than his other students he also knows that im a very shy and anxious student i dont know why but i trust him a lot and i really like him i kind of wish he knew what was going on in my why just to share with someone because i feel very lonely and isolated and hes the only person id want knowing this i feel uncomfortable just telling him i know he would feel bad for me but thats too awkward and i dont want to feel weird about it or make it a big deal how can i signal to him without directly letting him know that im down thank you,post-pandemic
one day i just know i will do it i dont quite know when because i still hold on to the tiniest bit of hope that things will get better but i feel so worn down and broken after giving my all to others and emotional trauma from my childhood i dont have much energy or will to go on the dark thoughts creep up on me everyday and i find myself saying not yet rather than not ever,post-pandemic
im so angry and tired ive been severely depressed stressed out and at some points even suicidal i noticed a massive decline in energy and motivation to do anything i can barely stay awake most days and get necessary work done so that i wont be destitute the house is messy and i am messy i dont brush my hair for days and im always unkempt in comes my fianc nagging and criticizing me about all the things im not doing telling me im a bad person and how im so terrible they want to leave me for someone else it used to bother me a lot because i valued what he thought about me this is someone i loved a lot but now hes just another asshole in my life except the shit comes out his mouth he directly contributed to my depression and suicidal feelings i cried every night because of his cruelty and now that im finally starting to get better and trying to improve my life he swoops in again trying to sabotage me while im already down he calls me lazy but the truth is im just severely depressed and also physical unhealthy from lack of selfcare his words are poison hes like an annoying pest a mosquito if you will constantly sucking blood from me while simultaneously insulting me i just want to swat him with a fly swatter so i can be rid of him and move on with my life im depressed but also starting to get very angry,post-pandemic
i dont think people understand how stressful it is to explain whats going on in your brain when you dont even understand it yourselfand yet i really would love to talk to surtent people but im to afraid that i will annoy them and that they will run away from me or worse that they dont even care so i will continue to sit in my room and i will drown in my own thoughts i wish someone would notice and would come and help me to find out how to get better again i know its just a stupid wish because no one is willing or able to take that amount of time that it would take to help me but i think the worst part is that i cant do it alone and i also cant ask someone for help and all these storys about these magical people who just know what they are supposed to do i start thinking they dont exist but if they do i would really need one now because sometimes i disappear when im lonely and i need someone with a rope bringing me back to reality,post-pandemic

i like feeling depressed i often do my clearest thinking and am at my most comfortable while depressed i have never really liked highly optimistic happy people in a world chock full of pain suffering brutality loss cruelty injustice unfairness poverty and hurt having an optimistic demeanor seems out of tune with the reality that surrounds us everyday to the point it is mildly insulting depression makes a lot of sense and is more inline with experience of daily life i may be a depressed person but from my perspective all that means is that i accept and embrace the sadness and struggle of everyday life i do not blind myself from the pain of modern life like optimistic people do i internalize it and make it part of who i am people with depression do not need to be force fed happiness and optimism they are just seeing the world as it really is and there is nothing wrong with that for better or worse i have made friends with my depression as my life companion and i do not feel like there is anything wrong with me i would rather accept the painful reality that life is hard than blind myself with the naive and blissful ignorance that optimistic people do,post-pandemic
its unfair how those people who dont want to be here has to struggle with a healthy body while others who enjoy life get cancers let me swap with the ones who want to live you can have my healthy body and be happy and give me what is killing you so i can go you want to be here and i dont it would be a fair trade,pre-pandemic

if something upsets you bothers you hurts you makes you uncomfortable then it matters just because soandso has problems that seem worse than yours it doesnt make your issues invalid it kills me when someone opens up and talks about what going wrong in their life and the person theyre talking to says well at least it isnt any worse that makes me feel so little and like an annoying complainer because obviously my life isnt actually that bad,pre-pandemic
jesus how do i even start as you could read by the title im a black man ive always been in the fight grew up with racism in all its forms in my country which ironically usually denies there ever being racism in any way the kind of shit ive heard through my entire life has molded me into someone with no selfesteem sense of selfworth voice and made into introvert because of the mentality of you need to work twice as hard as everyone out there i always saw the future as bleak tiresome and as more struggle this never really changed it just got worse with time with college and the awful reality that came afterwards ive been depressed for most of my life with my initial diagnosis at age 9 i still have it with severe anxiety my first suicidal thoughts came at age 8 and then and there i already hated myself for everything for not being enough for not being what the world wanted for failing myself at being the best for never getting anything good out of my own life for never letting myself rest or be human and with all the recent events like the absurd police brutality worldwide the rise of authoritarianism in my country with being worked to the bone and around the clock due to the pandemic with my country quickly moving up to be the worst afflicted by covid19 and my mom and me being in danger during these times by living in a neighbourhood near a place where a white supremacist parade happened which also happens to be a place where a lot of people are simply disrespecting quarantine all of this shit is just wearing me down really badly i wake up exhausted i cant deal with anything without having a serious bout of anxiety or anger outbursts followed by fullscale breakdowns im feeling guilty by worrying my friends and my mom i feel guilty by feeling tired by feeling afraid i feel guilty by not feeling brave enough to go out on the streets for my people and taking action i feel guilty for existing im so fucking exhausted and i dont know what to do i just want it all to end i just wanna go somewhere else i cant handle anything anymore edit all of this support im very very thankful for it i think ive never felt this supported in my whole life all of your words have touched me deeply im so glad you helped me i feel more hopeful more energized from talking to you all thank you thank you all from the bottom of my heart youve all stopped me from doing something terrible today thank you edit 2 wow i was not expecting this kind of response from so many people im trying to respond to everyone but i think i cant id like to thank you all once more for all your words im very glad that i vented about all these feelings here with you all i feel so much support from you and i feel like my feelings are valid and worth feeling it may seem a bit dramatic but im legitimately walking out of this with a different outlook on life i never expected to see so many people i dont know just rush in to support me when im in my absolute worst so thank you once more for being here for me i mean it i love you all,post-pandemic
i used to cut a lot when i was a teenager up until i met my exfiancee she saw me cut once and told me dont ever do that again you hurt me when you do that and i never once did it again while i was with her but then she left slowly my depression worsened and i felt worse and worst i tried to pick up and move on tried to date again and trying to be positive hung out with friends more often tried to just get past my previous relationship but as i kept trying things just never worked out for me i kept getting turned down and stood up the pain of the past keep coming back realizing that ive never been in a loving family and the only loving relationship i had left me on a dime for someone else i kept on asking people out trying to be positive about things until finally i relapsed i just couldnt handle what was going on i relapsed a bit and had an episode but it was only a few times i tried seeing a therapist i requested my doctor put me back on my psych meds ive been trying to better my health and eat better and take better care of my body and mind but nothing ive done has made me any happier im in a much healthier living situation my apartment is no longer filthy all the time im eating healtier and trying to be more out there with my friends but nothing is helping and a few weeks ago what was a few episodes turned into constant cutting ive completely relapsed into cutting but far worse than before i used to only cut on my left wrist now its on my tummy and legs i dont know what else to do i keep getting rejected i keep getting turned down and told off ive tried so hard to keep things together to be confident and positve i listened to everyones advice and tried what they told me all ive met was failure so now im cutting a lot far worse than i used too these scars dont make me any more attractive im already not attractive they just make everything worse but what else can i do im so sick of crying myself to sleep so sick of being turned down over and over so sick of remember that my family abandoned me ontop of all thats going on i feel like the steps ive taken to make myself happier with whom i am and whats happened to me has only made everything worse im so tired of being alone every step of the way from childhood to adult its been the same shit over and over rejection abuse and having to deal with it completely alone yes i have friends i have some great friends but friends dont help heal the wounds of a lonely soul the only thing keeping me sane is bleeding,pre-pandemic
im an 18 year old female with both i have no friends whatsoever in real life or online im completely serious when i say i dont have a single friendship i usually stay at home waiting for my parents to come back from work so i at least have them to talk to on the weekends i go for long walks deep in the woods and read its very quiet and i find myself talking alone a lot of the time its a shame because i try my hardest to be kind i think i have a lot of love to give but its just backed up somewhere on top of this i do have diagnosed depression and i have constant thoughts of suicide ive come to the conclusion that i simply deserve to be alone and god has punished me its either suicide or continue suffering i dont want to die i need to learn how to live with both of these but even now in my adulthood i still dont know any advice thank you,post-pandemic
its just so fucking tiresome you see it everywhere on social media people will go on and on and on about how we should all reach out to mentally ill people then when you have the courage to reach out to them the same fucking people will tell you bullshit like man up stop being so sensitive hey bro at least youre not a starving child in africa bro its just your mindset you gotta start thinking more positively and so on like whats the fucking point whenever we do reach out we either get scolded or our problems get dismissed im not trying to say this is how it is for everyone but this is just from my experiences i just want someone to fucking listen just once and for once i want to be able to tell someone about this without fear of eventually getting ghosted is that asking for too much,post-pandemic

im 24 and my last half year has been an extreme sack of shit i was a dedicated neonazi supporter of japanese farright for 23 years lost almost all my friends except for 2 of them i guess they thought i was just being a troll online with all the extreme right posts but i didnt really care about that then this period surprisingly was where i thought i found my lifes purpose just 5 months ago i slipped into the worst episode of existential ocd i had several episodes of ocdlike intrusive episodes before but they were more trivial matters my mind was constantly bombarded by questioning of reality solipsism existence etc etc 247 it was most intense for the first 2 and half months and subsided a tiny bit thereafter during that time i pretty much abandoned my farright beliefs as a matter of fact my brain cant focus on anything except triggering random panic attacks near constant anxiety almost immediately after i wake up and intrusive fearful thoughts about me developing some serious mental disorder i was super glad to have my parents help me through it just talking to them about these thoughts gave me some brief moments of comfort and hope throughout the day things got better when my female coworker started hanging out with me more we gradually began spending more time together grabbing food and driving to different places i felt more human although intrusive thoughts and panic feelings still haunt me at least they dont happen so often throughout the day and my brain can actually for once in months focus on something else i developed attachments to her but the only thing keeping me from committing to her is our age gap she is 5 older than me last week and half ago this realization hits especially hard in my soul i can never be with her but yet i have deep affections for her she most likely view me as just a good friend and a convenience she was the world to me but to her shes probably just using me to pass time until she finds an actual boyfriend this realization plunged me into an episode of existential depression not existential ocd like before you know the feeling of yearning to be with someone but you know its impossible this aching feeling is burying deep into my soul i have been coping with this feeling by developing a nihilistic view of life everything will come to an end whether its relationships friendships etc etc you find a girlfriend date her for a time being you either breakup or get married if you decided to get married it would either end up in divorce or one of you passing away either way in the end its all nothingness and youll feel broken love is a dreadful bond an extremely painful one it feels way better to hate others than to fall in love and experience the nothingness of it all in the end i have decided to sever any attachments i have with her minimize talking contact etc i am also beginning to revert to my former neonazi self and i think this is the safest choice whats left is to wander the remaining time i have left on this earth,post-pandemic

36f i have adhd depression and anxiety my life is not where i want it to be medication has rarely helped my family has taken the view at this point that interfering in my life is infantilising me and isnt working in any case so they have emotionally abandoned me by this i mean they dont ask me questions anymore even how are you how was your dayweekend its like im in emotional jail as someone who has been deeply affected by loss and abandonment in the past aswell as having extreme emotional disregulation all this does is make me feel alone useless a failure unlovable and that i may aswell give up i cant seem to find it in me to find a way out of this situation im in or find a way to care about my fate the overriding and overwhelming feeling i have often every waking hour with brief moments of distraction is total hopelessness and despair i get its frustrating for those around me who feel powerless but at least before i felt loved and i felt people gave a damn about me even if i wasnt where i wanted to be i dont care about myself and now it feels like nobody else does either i get that for a lot of people reaching rock bottom would give them a push and the drive to pull themselves up and find a solution but all it does for me is make me want to sleep more watch more tv to escape read more and sleep more and try and forget about my existence often i think it would be easier for everyone if i died how do you explain to mentally normal people that this isnt simply me being lazy infantile and happy to live in my comfort zone i cant find the words to help everyone around me understand the mental state im in and have been in for so long grateful for any advice,post-pandemic
using a throwaway account ive asked myself this question so many times but i still dont know posting here because i think it would violate radvice i am struggling with mental health issues and one of the things i need to figure out is if something was a rape or not feel free to remove this post if it violates the rules we were at the same age 7 i had known the boy since forever we grew up as neighbors we were best friends im a girl btw i dont remember the order of things what i know is that he asked to see mine several times but i always said no he did push me to have sex with him i couldnt say no i tried but i didnt even know what was going on we were standing we didnt do it fully i went over to his place one time and he wanted to have sex of course i said no and said we could make out instead i remember i couldnt breath seriously we were just kids kids dont know how to kissanother time i remember us being in his room under some blankets while his mother was in the house i dont remember what we did after a while i wanted to do it with him but didnt know how to say it to him i was scared others knew and lost contact with him i dont remember for how long it happened but i recall us sitting in my closet he said that it was one year since i promised him that he could see mine thats all i remember i think he pushed me for a year or somethig before we started doing it i dont know really i do know that i became attached to him and hated it when the offer was of the table were we just kids fooling around or was it a rape can it be a factor to why im struggling to this day i just know that it happened and i remember very little of it in one way after a while i wanted it but i clearly did not want it in the first place as mentioned feel free to remove this i just hope someone here have any advice or new perspective edit one more thing i was visiting a family friend a girl who was my age well turned out she was kinda crazy we decided to set up a tent on the lawn this was on the countryside the grown ups were in house 100 metres away she said she used narcotics which of course wasnt true we were 910 she did have some pills though she said she couldnt sleep and other stuff we laid quietly in our own sleeping bag when she started talking inher sleep she might have been awake and faking it but all i know is that she was talking she tried to touch me and kiss i was freaked out and tried to keep her off me she was strong after an indefinite amount of time she stopped and we slept the day after she tried to watch porn with me she turned on the computer and entered some porn site i left same day we were at a stony beach we created a little shelter from the wind and she tried to kiss me i think she did i dont remember it so clearly do think we kissed i have no idea whats up with this weird stuff i dont feel like it affected me but as i write this i realize some of it is kinda fucked up,pre-pandemic

since i was born i always dreamt about having a role model having a masculine figure that would teach me how be a man able to face any kind of trouble in life to be a man strong enough to be assertive and confident no matter what sadly that dream never came true im indeed a product of a single motherhood as far as my biological dad is concerned he has never really been around and did very little if not nothing as a dad he finally passed away a couple of years ago his family dont want have anything to do with me according to them im a failurethe only man having been present in my life was the one my mother married to 17 years ago im still amazed how fast she married him they got married 4 months after they met ive been psychologically and physically abused told time and time again i was an accident my mother didnt do anything to stop that and used to take his side the reason being she was desperate and didnt want her reputation to be undermined they got divorced in 2014 today im 24 years old and though having a degree im unemployed i got no friend let alone girlfriend i got no kids either ive never been good at making friends becoming entrepreneur is therefore the first idea that went through my mind as a loner i wanna work for nobody but myself however even though im ambitious deep down i feel empty i feel weak i even noticed ive been sort of feminized over the years and it pains me just how hard it is to not be able to embrace my masculinity whenever i talk to people mostly women whenever i open my mouth i got this insecurity that takes over me which affects the way i talk as well as my body language im working on all that to work my situation out but i aint gonna lie to you its tough pretty much when a male figure has never been there to guide me no wonder why most criminals come from single motherhood the amount of anger is such they end up killing people like you know this society is casting fathers aside by giving women full custody and we all know where this leads crimes poverty and even suicides someday i wanna write a book about that in order to let people know how meaningful it is for a child to have a father in his life one more thing a mom wont ever be able to raise a boy on her own let alone able to make him a man,pre-pandemic
im in high school and most of my life i grew up fat because of that i was always insecure of my body and never truly accepted myself for how i look i have a partner and theyre really amazing when it comes to being supportive and loving but at the same time they make sexual jokes about other people it makes me really insecure about how they feel those ways about someone else and it makes me feel like im not enough ive tried talking to them about it they understood me and tried to refrain from making comments like that but yet i see that they think its tiring to stop themselves from making jokes like that because of that now i feel like a shitty partner thats just making a big deal out of everything and i hate myself for it,post-pandemic

i smoke a cigar three to four times a year when i have poker nights with my buddies what ive noticed is that smoking a cigar completely eliminates my residual depression my thoughts perceptions feelings and emotions change completely for the better negative thoughts and mental ruminations are no longer present the effect lasts for several weeks it works better than all the antidepressants i have tried so far ssris nortriptyline pregabalin promethazine mirtazapine and some others smoking cant be the solution and i dont want to smoke more often and become addicted nevertheless it is an interesting finding after smoking a cigar i feel like ive been reborn have any of you experienced something similar,post-pandemic

im going to make some very uneducated statements but i believe them in my heart i have never studied psychology although im interested in it and ive only once gone to a therapist for anxiety i think i could very well be classified as depressed however i tick all the right boxes right down to frequent suicidal thoughts lets talk about suicidal thoughts the ones i have are i think very typical for a depressed person its the ones where every train of thought leads to the same destination suicide but not in an emotional way sure every now and then you cry your eyes out thinking about the unbearable sadness that you yes the you you have known your whole life the you that once was a sweet innocent kid with nothing but love and courage in its heart is going to leave this world forever im talking about the rational ones where you see suicide in a purely logical way and it makes sense to you but why why on earth does suicide make sense to you and im not talking about the old philosophy argument that asks is suicide is ever justified aah if the person suffers too much then it is only rational that the person wants to end that suffering by any means im kind of paraphrasing here from a video of a lecture on suicide i saw on youtube the other day sure its an interesting topic nice thought experiments but you could just as easily be talking about if horses should kill themselves or not or made up aliens in a distant galaxy or something its simply irrelevant its irrelevant to the world we live in people are killing them selves more and more people why why are we killing ourselves i feel like if we really think about it if a person would stop for a moment and think of the people on earth how we live our lives how we treat each other and the planet that person wouldnt be surprised that some people just hate themselves they loathe themselves they feel like a cancer and the only solution is to get rid of the cancer to get rid of themselves the point here that i have been trying to make is that i believe depression isnt as great of a mystery as some might think that is we are all people and we know what it means to be deeply sad even the happiest people i believe that if we search deep down in our feelings we know what is the cause of this cancer in peoples minds,pre-pandemic
i wonder how much longer i can continue like this,pre-pandemic
my life is falling apart before my eyes once again for the 10th time and i find myself sitting in bed at 1am fantasying about my wife finding my corpse and finally realizing how badly what shes doing is killing me on the inside same story different person i finally find happiness only to have it taken away from me in the blink of an eye im so tired of this somehow i convinced myself id grown out of my depression and suicidal tendencies only to have it come back in full force i only wish i had the balls to finally pull the fucking trigger take one final step forward off that chair or cut just a little bit deeper this time i dont know maybe thisll finally be what it takes to do it,post-pandemic
even though ive been posting in rdepression for months now this is the first post where i actually feel like people might think im crazy but i feel like i cant hold it in any longer ive been feeling religious lately not religious in the sense that im gravitating towards any organized religion but religious in the sense that i believe that after we die were reabsorbed into some kind of universal consciousness we are like sensory organs for a massive entity thats running a simulation that massive entity call it god call it whatever isnt some separate consciousness isnt some old man demanding to be worshipped its us all of us taken together forming a vast biocomputer thats running a program we call existence im looking for the religion that best fits me if i hold this view i feel like being able to express it and being together with others who believe the same thing might make me feel saner i also worry that this idea is just a product of a broken mind and i know that my mind is broken in many different ways i try to help people as much as i can in the hopes that through helping them ill help myself i dont know what i want from this post perhaps other people telling me that they believe the same thing perhaps someone to argue with i do enjoy debate,pre-pandemic

i miss who i was before august 18th 2023 i wasnt much different really but i was free from knowing what im capable of i know if i try and say nothing then i can really be gone no icu no ward no more being a headache to myself and everyone around me i wonder if people can feel the dread that seems to loom around me whenever im alone i wonder if it even really matters to them as long as i appear okay i am right im not being a nuisance that way maybe if i just keep avoiding everything and everyone around me then ill be less of a weight on everyones shoulders but avoiding everyone surely doesnt make that weight go away but if people expect me to avoid and ignore then i guess it means they get used to it which is good but also not they can be used to it and enjoy my company whenever i show up again and when i leave itll be like nothings changed i wonder if it would stay that way if i wasnt around anymore would it change would anything change would my same old social routine where i ignore and avoid anyone and everyone that cares about me feel much different maybe theyll just think im gone for a few more weeks or months and then ill come back so they wont think twice when i leave im entering dangerous territory again i dont think im cut out for whatever life is supposed to be is anyone cut out for it maybe some people are just more resilient or less aware maybe being less aware is a better way to be but ive been like this for a while now a very long time i dont remember ever not being this way or thinking this way i guess august 18th just really solidified it it was proof im not just pretending or exaggerating for show but if i know that then i guess thats all i wanted to know i wanted to know i was a whole person who isnt just a body or just an idea that i made up or just someone looking for someone to care i was me i am me i always have been and ive always known this maybe thats all i needed and now i can rest where else is there for me to go,post-pandemic
hi reddit life has been feeling really difficult lately i could give a lot of context but ill try and keep it short im a 27f who lost my parents in my early 20s ive been through a lot of grief in my life and im still working through that but im also starting to feel like theres something wrong with me everything feels like a means to the end im kind of struggling to find my purpose lately im single and everyone around me is getting married so my relationship status has always been an anxiety for me im also in an unconventional line of work exotic dancing which i absolutely love and has given me a lot of flexibility and financial independence but sadly the world looks down on me for that as well its been hard to date because of my occupation and outside of the club i just dont feel like im worth very much to people i go to therapy a couple times a month but im not sure if its even really helping im on cymbalta as well but i would like to get off of it on top of that ive recently cut out a lot of people in my life who just have been using me for sexual pleasure that sex has been my crutch to deal with depression but im ready to find a lasting relationship and not just have casual flings anymore which unfortunately casual flings were something im good at so without them i feel a little bit weird anyways this is more of a open letter to myself i guess but i would appreciate any advice you might have maybe for how to date with depression and how to feel fulfilled in your life even if your life isnt that exciting,post-pandemic

do you ever look at yourself in the mirror and think about death you think about the consequences of it and what peoples views are on it maybe you have even considered suicide you brush it off most likely that is what most people do people are scared i am scared who would actually want to die though right this is what casually being suicidal is can you have suicidal thoughts and want to die at the same time i have a fear of death i always have always will how is it that some days i want everything to end but i dont at the same time its my biggest fear but also my biggest relief my biggest wish in reality i just want the pain to stop why is everything so difficult sure you would tell me to go get therapy go get tested by a psychologist or something as if that advice means anything you want to label us as if everyone feels the same thing people like this are the same in some ways sure they are but most people dont want to die they want it to stop what exactly do they want to stop people people are predictable what other reasons are there for someone to want to go as far as think these awful thoughts even good people turn bad everyone is bad even me people tell you to talk to others about these feelings that it will help but only people who experience these kinds of thoughts would understand and even then it would give them this negative thing to relate to is that really a good thing to relate in wanting to die back to my point what can people do i cant call myself depressed because im not sad all the time i cant say i have anxiety because im not anxious all the time it goes on the point of this paragraph is to say dont tell people to ask for advice or say that you understand what they are going through i always tell people what im going through they brush it off talking about it can help but only for the right people for people like me i dont exactly know if i have specific mental health to blame everything on im just feeling like this thats all x200b x200b for all the comments im sorry i cant reply to them all but i will try to when i get round to it but i want to say this now for anyone who will be reading in the future please feel free to pm me ill always reply didnt realise this would blow up but it is nice to know people feel the same way i hope you find some sort of comfort in that as i do stay safe someone shared this link with me if you want you can read it,post-pandemic

hi reddit this is my first post here but i was not sure where else to go to get a hopefully substantialvaried response pool i 26 m am not sure how to help my very depressed boyfriend 24 m when he spirals and bursts with the weight of the world hes suffered from depression his whole life but lately it has become a regular occurrence where something relatively small will send him spiraling into telling me that he wants to die that the world is fundamentally ruined and wrong and that nothing will ever change or be fixed i try as hard as i can to tell him that this is not the end and that things can and will improve that there is still hope and reasons to fight but i feel like i never say the right things and i cannot help pull him out of that panic and doom spiral i can hear him often listening to videos on the current state of the world politics war poverty etc or see him doom scrolling for hours and i do not want it to be condescending to ask him to stop or to try to distract him but i know it just makes him feel worse so my question is is there anything that i can do to help him what helps someone out of doom spirals what do you need someone to do or say,post-pandemic
i hope you all dont lose hope im doing fantastically well today i spent years feeling horrible but i hope you all are open to getting better i spent 2 years going from one need to the next i was constantly tired no one is happy tired i was highly resistant of coming off of trazadone how would i sleep i was on lamictal and it helped me a lot when i went on it years ago i was resistant to coming off it i fell asleep without it one day and was more awake than i had been in years i decided to try going off it my nurse friends told me lamictal causes drowsiness and a bit of brain fog we decided to also go off this i havent felt so good in so many years i would in no way encourage to go off meds as a way to treat the depression i do encourage to be open to stopping a med youve had for a very long time if your feeling terrible while youre talking it exhaustion is a huge trigger for my depression im sure ill have dips in my depression but hope is not lost i hope this helps someone,post-pandemic
when i feel ok i feel off when i sink into a depressive mindset in a twisted way my brain feels almost satisfied its like my life is so shit that if im not feeling overly depressed about it there is something off like im wasting time being ok or even happy this might make zero sense but its a feeling ive had for so long,pre-pandemic
im so tired i feel like i cant even move around at this point the past couple of nights ive felt so sad and angry all at once i have to keep holding back the urge to just want to strangle myself to death or shoot myself in the head i hate feeling like this but i just cant stop i cant stop feeling so over it i have the feeling that something was about to kill me but i had a chance to live id just want to have my life ended and finally not have to deal with anything anymore i dont want to have to be sad and anxious about my life and if i will amount to anything or not i dont wanna be angry with the people around me for being happy or being so jealous of people that i end up hating them i just dont want to feel like this anymore fuck it i dont want to feel in general i want to stop having my head filled with so much sadness and negativity and i just wish i could finally sleep one night and never have to worry about waking up ever again i hate this i hate feeling so trapped i cant escape from whats going to happen to me i just want to fucking get away from it but i cant and i hate it the pain of loneliness is unbearable to be an outcast everywhere you go to not be special enough to even get approached to try so hard to be something youre not in order to fit in its all a hellish experience in the mind it affects my thinking it makes me feel worthless and unworthy i dont wanna live with this pain why should i live with this type of pain when others around me dont have to everyone else has at least one good friend to care about them meanwhile i have no one its torture the world would just be better off without me thats what the worlds been trying to show me anyway so why not fulfill my purpose in not having a purpose my schizophrenia is getting worse as well i see dark figures all around my room i cant get a second of sleep as im typing this ive been awake for 5 days im now hallucinating on top of the schizophrenia around my friends im trying so hard to not show that i havent gotten a waking minute of sleep in about a week when im not around my friends i struggle to even stay conscious some people tell me to try and actually sleep and just ignore that they exist fact is i cant schizophrenia is literally discharges from the brain meaning that i ignore that it is fake every time it discharges im just really sick of the bullshit about stop for me please and the time will heal it as much as i want too i cant i fucking cant i dont understand what your point is on telling me not to do it like what do you expect me to do i honestly cant even take it anymore one of these waking nights maybe even tonight i will just hang up a rope and end it all,post-pandemic

on valentines day i 21fhad a surprise for my boyfriend20m but he lied to me about where he wasi waited for about an hour waiting to surprise him until he told me that he had lied to me and that he was not where he had told me he told me that he had a reason why he did that and he wanted to explain to me he told me that for some time he had relapsed into depression and that he was missing college classes for a couple of weeks and that he didnt want to tell me anything because he was embarrassed of having depression and missing class he didnt want me to see him differently because of that problem and that he wasnt good with himself these last few months i told him that i was not going to judge him for anything that i was going to help him to find professional help and try to overcome all of this but i honestly dont know what to do what happened that day still hurts me and i really dont know to what extent i can trust him which is obviously what i would like i just want to know what you think or what your point of view is i love him very much and i would like to support him and see him improve as much as possible despite everything but honestly i dont know what to do,post-pandemic

ive had a bunch of stuff happen to me in the past month i got appendicitis and surgery still recovering accidentally twisted my ankle i got a cold which im still fighting however none of that seemed to be enough for people to give me a break from emotional labor they demand it from me 247 practically not asking for advice really just ranting these are just a few examples i had my sister calling me talking about her boyfriend who just drinks all the time and does nothing and she was complaining about how she hates where she works i tell her to get rid of the man and get a job somewhere else it wasnt as short as it sounds i listened to her and gave her serious advice though i know she wont take it because she never does instead of thanking me no one ever does she tells me that its easy for me to tell her to just get another job because i dont have one and can just sit around and sleep well thanks i just love sitting around and thinking about my crappy life it is a positive joy we hadnt spoken until her son ended up in an issue and of course the family therapist me gets a text asking me to talk to her son and try to get him to listen to reason i agree just because i know my nephew doesnt get good support from her come to find out shes mad because hes dating some girl who has a kid already i cant say its great at his age but hes also an adult so i just told him to be careful watch out for emotional abuse and reminded him of his last relationship which was like a copy of his moms relationships she doesnt realize he gets his bad examples from her after talking to him his mom texts me and is like im getting off work in a few hours ill call and we can do a threeway call and talk to him nowhere did she ask me if this was okay didnt ask if i was busy or anything but as with most of my family since im at home i never have anything important to do so they just tell me to do stuff instead of asking like im a human being i tell her i texted him and i was still recovering and needed to sleep she didnt ask me what i was recovering from if i was okay nothing just said okay night my niece had trouble at school and shes a lot like my sister unable to let go of things shes upset because some girl at school wants to fight her because my niece took her chair a chair this girl wasnt using mind you but that was just sitting next to her my niece calls me upset and frantic over this because the girl wont let it go and went to the office and had my niece called out of class because the girl wanted an apology my niece refused because she said she hadnt even done anything and she went to the principal who told her that the girl is known for keeping things going so she wouldnt be bothered again but my niece wouldnt get off the phone until i promised to stay up until she got out of school in case they call her into the office again and she wanted me to talk to them a huge reason i dont have kids is so i dont have to deal with the stress of dealing with teachers and other parents yet i have to be a parent to my niece because my sister wont be mind you i had just come back from the doctor had been hopped up on pain meds and wanted to do nothing but sleep i forced myself to stay awake but thankfully no one called then my sister calls me and is crying telling me how much she wants her boyfriend to leave the house so i dont say anything and just let her talk finally shes like i just dont know what to do or how to get him out of my house i told her to call the police she doesnt want to get him in any more trouble because he has a dui because he drinks and drives she allows him to drink and drive her car because he doesnt have one and doesnt have a license i wont even touch how stupid that is so i get frustrated with her and tell her that i keep telling her how to get rid of him and she never listens so i dont know what she wants me to do she acts like i offended her and is like i just called to vent cant i vent sometimes i tell her that she can but im tired of getting calls almost every week about this man im not her therapist or life coach or anything im barely hanging on by a thread a lot of days and hearing about this situation distresses me because even if i dont like her very much i dont want to hear about anyone dealing with this type of stuff not to mention her best friend was killed just a few months ago by her boyfriend who was abusive and drunk a lot make him leave before he gets to that point anyway she accuses me of making it about me and hangs up maybe i did make it about me but i want people to understand that i am not a therapist and i cannot fix their issues and im not emotionally well enough to take on all this stuff im not sure anyone is tbh finally we come to today my mother had to take me to the doctor because i couldnt get there on my own and need support to get there were talking about normal stuff then shes like arent you tired of just sitting at home and doing nothing you really need to get out and get a life i dont ever like talking to my mom about my mental health because she acts like its a phase that should have been over in my teens and she doesnt understand why im letting it bother me as an adult id like to mention she has horrible anxiety as well but she powers through it to work at least it still takes over her life she also doesnt do much outside of the house and has no life but when i point that out she brings it back to me anyway i tell her i just paid all the bills and since the bills got higher i dont have money to have a life even if i wanted to so then shes like if you get a job youd have more money i know this but i have tried many times to hold a job i cannot do it for more than a few days without having panic attacks and breakdowns which either end up with me leaving or getting let go which then leads me into a deep depression she acts like i dont try and this is even with medicine and therapy sometimes im sure the main reason none of this works is because im around my family but i never tell them that because i dont want to deal with that fallout at this point im just tired of the conversation so i dont respond then she brings up how i need to get some friends at least says the woman who literally has one friend and who got upset at my aunt for going out without her even though she never goes anywhere when she invites her heavy eyeroll anyway i tell her that ive tried to have friends its not my fault they dont put effort in and either they end up not talking or i fade out because nothing is happening she asks me why i dont hang out with the people i met last summer the two girls i met last summer were nice but one would rarely go out with us because she would rather stay in with her boyfriend which left me and the other girl we hung out a few times but then she got a new trivia group and stopped texting me back so i stopped texting her and let that fade out this happens too often so i stopped trying to make friends i tell my mom that i dont talk to them anymore and shes like thats your problem you dont try and cut people off so quickly i texted the second girl every day for a week she wasnt working at the time and she was always posting snaps so i knew she was available i wasnt going to keep texting for no reason i try to have boundaries and get crapped on for them unfortunately i am not one of those people who will keep trying and trying and trying when i see things obviously arent going along anymore she then goes into this long story about how she met her only friend and how they only talk like once a month but they are still good friends and i need to be more realistic with friends what good is a friend whom i only talk to for 10 minutes once a month and hang out with maybe once every three months if that works for her great but thats not getting a life or anything else plus i have a history of getting friends and then i become the therapy friend and i fade away because all they ever do is come around to dump their problems on me and get advice then i dont hear from them for months when something else is going wrong thats not friendship to me and go back to my mom and my aunt my aunt is mad at my mom for checking up on her at her age and of course i get pulled into it because my mom is being childish and wont talk to my aunt so ive been designated the gobetween but i never said i would be they are 20 years older than me why am i even in this i dont know im just tired of being everyones therapist and mediator i keep trying to explain how draining it is they obviously see i have my own issues but they continually pour their issues onto me expect sincere helpful empathetic responses but let me feel bad or need something and everyone is busy or doesnt answer their phones or i get advice that isnt helpful my niece and nephew would probably talk but i dont want to burden them with my issues their mother does that to them enough and they complain about it to me of course what is it about me that makes everyone think im a therapist plus none of them pay me for my services that probably makes me more upset than anything if i was a real therapist id probably be rich off all these sessions lol,pre-pandemic
hi i know this is no place to ask but i dont wanna go to a professional because i dont want to get labeled because of whats going on in my head has anyone experienced recovering from depression and starts to get easily shocked like there are times where even small movements startle me i even got too emotional on things theres also like a restlessness inside me that i cannot understand where its coming i actually dont know if i recovered from my past state but i can now put aside my thoughts about sucid3 tho i cant completely ignore it i need someones input abt this because i want to understand what im experiencing right now ps honestly my current state is much more tiring than my past haha,post-pandemic
a house or apartment is surely different from a home and it seems i havent had a home for many many years now despite always having a place to stay i understand it is a gift to have shelter and i realize it may be insensitive to someone who is struggling with homelessness this is just my experience,post-pandemic
last night i did something with the intention of getting in trouble by police i cant bring myself to take pills or tie a noose but i get angry when i see a cop like full on rage i know once a cop steps foot on my property ill get mad enough to charge at them and they will have no choice but to put me down like a worthless animal then freedom at last,post-pandemic
to give more context i have known this girl for some time to the point id consider her a best friend weve hung out a lot and shes drunkenly made out with two of my best friends on separate occasions im 18 i just graduated from highschool as of june i decided to take a year off to make some money and then go to university next year i invite her ill call her k to a party my friend was having everyone was having a good time but then one of my other friends d was getting very creepy and odd towards k so instead of hanging with the herd i decided to do a decent friend move and get him to back off later into the night shes trying to sleep and d is follwing her around so i get the host c to come get him well thats going on i casually kissed k and then we proceeded to makeout a little and asking if it was okay c comes back with d and tells k about a room she can crash in around this time everything was super hazy shots of everclear were given out it was my first time drinking it and one way or another we were both in the room and in the bed i started to get handsy and i kept asking if it was okay and she said it was i wake up from her leaving the room the next morning saying gotta drive home for work see ya later or something along those lines i dont remember what happened at that very instance as i was still recovering and was still drunk around late noonish i woke up thinking everything was cool i felt really gross by what i did but i assumed everything was groovy as we were both very drunk and the worse thing that would have happen is i fingered her which i asked was okay and she said it was but as i said i was pretty ashamed of myself and didnt think much of it as it was consensual the next day i talked to her but the whole convo seemed off and later into the day i asked what was up she said what happened was a mistake but that it wasnt my fault it was just the situation she said it would be best if we werent friends and i decided to tell her about when i was raped at 15 how i had no control felt helpless even when i said no i told her that i never intended to do that to her and that was the reason i kept asking if it was okay but that i felt awful and that it would honestly never happen again because i loved her as a friend so much and id never want to hurt her she accepted the apology and we made plan to hang on wednesday party was sunday when she came down with another one of my friends things were off again she seemed distant and didnt look me in the eye after that a day or two later she was acting weird i called her and she said after seeing me in person she just couldnt be friends with me we both go emotional mostly me but k insisted it wasnt my fault it was just the situation we agreed to keep our friendship on hold a lot of stuff happened between then and now the gist is we agreed to just be casual friends but then on another drunken night i told my best friend ca about how she felt like punching him and stuff k somehow got told our one bestie who will be kt was texting me about it and she read what i was texting her it was kt told me and her friend sent me a snap of her saying im going to fight you and i broke down in tears on that day i thought keeping my distant was just for the best and decided just not to be friends as the situation escalated because of me again and i just wanted to stop hurting her i was also told by kt that k reacted poorly even when i explained that i was drunk so distance was for the best i asked kt to send a have a good futute please understand the situation and im really sorry kt told me she really didnt respond but was happy i sent her best wishes a couple weeks go by and im feeling a little better something i didnt mention was that as soon as the situation happened i couldnt fall asleep i would cry myself to sleep almost ever night feeling awful and shitty i had lost all motivation to do anything and was in a very sad state but i was getting better in that time period i started seeing a therapist and eventually started taking medication for my depression i decided to block k on most social medias with exception of facebook as i still wanted to make sure she was okay in some light also i thought blocking people was pretty extreme so i decided to keep k on my facebook a week goes by and now we are roughly two days away from today i dont pay much mind to k but notice shes going to this halloween and i was like rad okay maybe ill go to so i said i was going on the page left a witty comment and went about my day an hour or so later i noticed wasnt going anymore i tried searching her name and i was blocked i was a little upset i proceeded to talk kt about this as i have been thw whole time because instead of getting my anger out on k telling her how lame it was because i thought we were cool but that it was whatever one thing leads to another and i was saying that i couldnt even imagine continuing a friendship with k because i felt she juvenile and childish for acting the way she has been especially when it came to our relationship that she persisted it was the situation but would treat me terribly during the entire situation that she never realized how ive been feeling like a bordeline rapist and she didnt say anything to comfort me that i wasnt kt finally told me how k had been feeling you see kt was a buffer for me and kesley we basically would dump our feelings on kt so we wouldnt get mad at each other it worked and if one person said something about the other she would tell the other from what kt told me k was basically blowing this out of proportion i was upset about it because our relationship was done because of one awful night i digress k told kt i sexually assaulted her she has told three of her friends including kt as well i was having a panic attack i thought things were finally done and we could look past the situation and move on either as friends or not but i didnt think things were ever ever this bad k explained to kt even though she was saying okay with it she thought i would take the hint that it wasnt okay immediately i felt like shit i sexually assulted my best friend and have been nothing but bitter about her thinking that the situation was to blame but it was all my fault she felt this way k also said that whenever my name was mentioned or she saw me online she would feel anxious when she was starting to feel better she saw i commented on that halloween page and decided to block me then went straight to kt about it just as i have kt told me she believes her as has known her for much longer then i have and she never had a reason to lie kt also said she believes me because she knows how much i care about people and she knows im a good person and considering what happened to me she knows i would never do the same she knows that i never pressured my girlfriend now ex this would have been when i was 17 of a year into sex that in every other situation at a party or club when im invited to have relations or makeout with a girl i always say no no matter how drunk i am so she doesnt understand why i did what i did i dont either i felt sick to my stomach after hearing all of that all i could do was cry i hurt someone i truly care for and had just completely lost the will to live i decided that i was going to take my life as i cant live knowing i hurt someone i care about so much to the point where if she saw me she felt anxious the next day i had a job interview i was up till 4 crying and feeling like shit i looked it too and was late to the interview but somehow i got the job now were here today i just walked home from work as i dont have a license i have planned everything out i dont want to do it today but at some point this month i have thought about it a lot through all of august it happened at the beginning of that month but i now feel its the only way to set things right but i want help i still want to live but i just cant find a reason to im a monster i honestly just cant handle this i dont have my future planned out and now im an equal to every other rapist you see in the news so many other awful things have happened and when it did despite feeling like my life was meaningless i was still happy i found a reason to be happy knowing i was getting better making more friends and that i was a good person i was a social guy who was a friend to all but now i dont even have that i dont feel like im a good person but i still want to live and i have no one to turn to my therapist is on holiday until the 19th i looked up my situation on the internet and saw a similar post about someone who had a done something similar i know this is super long i apologize for being all other the place but i just cant think straight this is my last option,pre-pandemic
its not everyone but honestly being depressed doesnt mean you have to self pity yourself like there is no tommorow if you are sick of feeling like utter trash you should try finding a way around your depression not ride yourself deeper into the shit hole,pre-pandemic
im 43 never been in a relationship ive tried dating apps and never get any matches i got out regularly but never meet anyone i cant recall even meeting another single person for at least a decade loneliness and being sad because of it are not new to me however as time goes on ive come to realize that i wont meet some one and be able to live a happy normal life even if i did find someone i have far less experience than a person half my age and it would almost certainly be a deal breaker for them as i go on it gets harder and harder to want to keep trying the odds are so long against me it feels like wasted effort what i dont know is if i am just coming to accept my reality or sinking into depression i cant afford a shrink so i guess ill just see what strangers on the internet think,post-pandemic
i attended a graduation ceremony recently and the president of the university gave a speech about gratefulness the president was talking about shaking hands with people and noticing how some people didnt say thank you a part of the speech was you want an antidote to depression learn how to say thank you nbsp i could be wrong but isnt that one of the ignorant or offensive things to say like people dont have the right to be depressed because other people have it worse in their life or if youre thinking about the good things you have in your life you wouldnt be depressed,pre-pandemic
idk what it is but like i want someone to ask me how im doing maybe let me at least vent for a while i want to be honest and tell people how much i hate myself feel like a failure etc you know how it is but at the same time i dont want any pity i dont want someone feeling sorry for me and offering empty encouragement because they dont like hearing whats really going on in my head i want help but at the same time i want everyone to shut up and let me be myself,post-pandemic

im 25m and ive been struggling with depression and adhd and their usual repercussions pretty much all my life ive always had to deal with profound lack of motivation heavy lethargy low self esteem learning difficulty being unable to force myself to focus and thus the never ending fight to overcome the typical hurdles of life whether were talking about being a good student in school or currently university being a good employee friend lover or even taking care of myself or my surroundings like my apartment room i feel like ive always had to struggle twice as hard to come half as far while never getting rewarded anything while being overtaken by everyone its so fkn tiring even though i do have things to love for friends and family and even some passion when i come to think of my future i only see darkness i feel like im too weak and unstable to accomplish and maintain anything meaningful and anything i enjoy and anything im skilled at doesnt really present me with any kind of meaningful opportunity the only things im passionate about are art music but im probably not good enough to make a living working some shitty dead end job makes me wanna kill myself studying at the university is what im trying to do currently but i lack motivation to sit down and learn and the focus to actually get good grades my low self esteem came to be through several different means but i constantly put myself down discredit myself and postpone my future because im terrified of failing i feel like im so fucked in the head and so messy thats theres barely any hope for meaningful change currently i live and study with a good friend of mine i enjoy our time together but i feel guilty and embarrassed about my deficites hes very kind and patient but i know im putting a strain on him with my issues hes also like the opposite of me hes healthy motivated and driven and this is a double edged sword because it does motivate me to be better on some days but makes me feel worthless and pathetic on other days i wish someone could save me i wish i could rest for as long as i need without having to worry about anything i wish i was normal,post-pandemic

i am writing this here instead of telling someone i know because im to scared to i dont like myself for many reasons like the way i act look or even think ive recently been having times where some days i would just think the worst things of myself and i feel this way because i cant even come home and stay awake or do anything i feel like i should tell someone about this but my parents see me as a normal happy teenager and my friends see me as a energetic person who does anything i dont know what to do and just want help,post-pandemic
guys question because i dont understand before taking antidepressants you have been prescribed anxiolytics before i have known people diagnosed with depression who have been treated with anxiolytics i want to know your experience can it actually cure depression and if so doctors why divide depression with anxiety when so called anxiety drugs can work for depression as well and as less side effects,post-pandemic
i have never really posted anywhere i cannot really say i have never talked to anyone about anything because i have but the responses are a bit frustrating oh yes i was sad before i went through some mild depression for a little so i know how you feel i suppose i end up with some sympathy when i really want some empathy maybe i need someone to really actually know what i am saying when i say i am having a hard time i dont want to talk or wake up or do anything anyhow the doubting essentially i was diagnosed with depression and anxiety about a year ago i had always wanted to talk to someone im 22 now about how i was feeling or about how i would suddenly freak out because everything seemed so overwhelming when trying to decide where to put a box but had never pulled myself to go until a sudden straight 4 weeks of feeling sleepily numb with a dash of annoyance and selfloathing but now i wonder here or doubt myself because i try to read all these things on depression trying to get a better understanding and i feel many of the symptoms but i feel like im not suppose to be able to laugh or enjoy myself too i dont really understand any of this and i really have no one to talk to because no one gets it i dunno i am babbling just needed to throw it somewhere,pre-pandemic

in the past few yearslike 23 i have seen a lot of bs and the only answer thing ive learnt is life is an endless cycle of struggle with no reward till you die i have had to see my demented grandfather get worse everyday and change his clothes because he takes off his diaper and my grandmother cant obviously handle everything on her own i have had to see her cry comfort her handle my parents fight break things one hit my head and i got stitches and openly converse about divorce and cheating i have to prepare for the hardest exam in the world and all of that is fine such is life but whats the fucking point of it when the fuck do things get better the magical fucking fantasy these guys drilled into my head is out and everyday i just wake up realising im all alone everyones busy with their shit and all i can do right now is study 14 hrs a day a subject i dont like very much yes i made blunders in life but im just a child with the wrong guidance now wtf do i do if my asian parents wanted me to be an engineer and their way of not forcing a decision on me is to tell me strongly about it and then say ball is in your court like you tell a child who hasnt not seen anything in the world strongly about one field while hes confused and then unless he takes a strong stance and resists your every word while being afraid of you your decision is final i have now as a failure signed up for 13 entrance exams all while i dont even want to live because whats the fucking point of all this it doesnt get better the future holds my grandfather finally succumbing to his illness my parents finally getting divorced and me possibly taking a gap year and spending another 1 year in the housejail studying for prestigous institutions even after i get a college move out so what lets take that scenario what will i have struggle for the future i mean does it all amount to anything you go on in life with one problem and another till you fucking die so why not just end it before,post-pandemic

look at them the simple sheep the horde of avarice some of them are willing to fight steal or argue just for a fancy piece of electronics is it desperation from being near to poverty is it an obsession with fiscal efficiency is it a gift to a friend where beers and a hug would be infinitely more meaningful and cheaper still it hurts because i think a lot about everything and i mean everything from atoms to the universe to existence itself i can find my smile in a sunset and comfort in the arms of my girlfriend long distance now but together before long a good meal can remove or at least improve a state of depression because simple things producing simple feelings has become my escape from the rampant complexity and misery of my own thoughts i am infinitely thankful for such a mechanism without these small moments i would be dead and all of it less important to these people than a big tv a game system or even a pile of processed meat merely a day after being thankful for those very moments i hold to be of immense significance their faces betray their panicked selfishness a thousand people in a store and yet all of them in that moment look so alone,pre-pandemic

this country is so depressing now its a nightmare living here maybe not compared to third world countries but definitely compared to how it was here 3 decades ago i would argue that there were five main events that successively caused this country to go downhill and just become increasingly depressing to live in the republican revolution in 1996 headed by newt gingrich the september 11 attacks in new york city in 2001 the financial crisis on wall street and the great recession in 2007 social media and the advent of smart phones and mass internet communication around 2008 when the iphone was launched and lastly the 2016 presidential elections in the complete shit show of donald trump getting elected,pre-pandemic

i believe that there is something incredibly wrong with the medication zyrtec that can cause aggression and ultimately violence i have not seen this side effect talked about very much online and i would like to spread the truth about it not long after my first few doses of zyrtec for seasonal allergies i was 16 at the time i began to get angry more often and im not talking about mild irritability im referring to explosive outbursts of anger this transition from being mild mannered to agressive took my peers and those close to me by surprise on top of that i felt somewhat manic i couldnt sleep and i barely ate just a side note i had no history of mental illness before taking zyrtec it was only after i stopped taking it that these symptoms gradually dissapeared i have never felt this angry before or after in my life afterwards i started feeling incredibly depressed and suicidal i later took to the internet to seek answers and sure enough a small group of peope expressed having the same issues especially amongst adolesents im wondering if any of you have had this issue and if so maybe we should speak up about it,post-pandemic
i think the world is beautiful there are so many amazing things to see and do and seemingly countless possibilities too many for a single lifetime i think people are amazing and the shitty terrible people dont prevent me from appreciating the good ones whom i consider to be the majority to me life is wonderful except i dont like my life i wish i could be somebody different somebody less mediocre someone more attractive more intelligent more motivated more adventurous and more knowledgeable about what im looking for in life im 21 and all i can think about is everything i have missed out on and will miss out on in life i wish there was some sort of way to choose to be someone else i dont want to stop playing i just wish i could start a new game,pre-pandemic

when someone seems depressed or suicidal normies feel compelled to do something but cant really be bothered so they do the following copy paste suicide hotline links and write pm me if you need to talk suicide hotline links are about the laziest most slap in the face shit you can do to someone whos actually posting suicidal shit if they are posting it they obviously want to talk about it wherever it is that they posted it not be directed to a hotline they could easily google just dont say anything then but your egos just need to feel youre heroes right pm me if you need to talk is just as retarded but worse as instead of giving them a referral to contact allegedly equipped strangers youre giving them a referral to contact you a person is fucked up and now you put a burden on them to pm a total stranger for some reason and think of what to say cause talk is so conveniently unspecific and useless because you didnt even have to bother to prove youre someone theyd want to talk to of course why would you someone amazing like you is doing them a favor just by making this offer let them take the initiative right you didnt do absolutely anything when it comes to reaching out except youll still feel like you did with your super generous offer to be given attention and acknowledgment as a potential savior of the suicidaldepressed the person youre sending this shit to already said something if you have anything of value to say to that either reply properly or pm them with the reply demonstrating you want to talk and give them something to go by if you dont have anything to say dont burden them go fuck off and post references on askreddit since repeating what youve heard and seen before is the best contribution you have to offer its ok it will get you upvotes every time i see this exchange i wish i could reach out through the screen grab the normie saying this by the throat and tear it out so that i get to pull it in back into my universe while their dead body without a throat remains in theirs and everyone wonders what happened then they see the last thing they wrote was pm me if you need to talk soon a pattern is noticed and an urban legend created making these words a taboo no one dares to say ever again,pre-pandemic

you know there is difference between having people around and feeling like you can share your emotional life with them i always had people around me but i always felt i was lonely because i never really trusted anyone enough to show them how i truly feel the amount of self hatred i have for myself is immense i am ffeeling like this since a very young age of maybe 11 or 12 i am almost 20 now i i feel those lonely for about 89 years wtf are this figures even real i never really had friends in school i have at most 12 friends from school which can called as friends but they also really know anything about me if you see i have no one who truly knows how i feel and think about myself and how i treat myself so harshly that i am some kind of a robot who is always need to working at its full capacity without any break i dehumanise myself because of the amount of selfhatred i have towards me this self hatred also comes out in the form of self harm at times self harm includes pinching yourself until the part of body you are pinching get numb punching your own head because i cant really deal with negative emotions so in general i keep my feels and emotions always numbed and because of numbing the negtaive emotions you also have to numb the positive emotions as well so i never really felt what it is to be happy,post-pandemic
depression doesnt exist you just want to be special and quirky you stay in bed all day cause youre lazy most people diagnosed with depression dont even meet the diagnostic criteria why cant you just be happy depression is just an excuse x200b i think ive heard it all at this point really if depression doesnt exist is that why i lay in bed all day starving myself if depression doesnt exist is that why i leave the duty that is showering at weeks at a time i didnt realize being smelly was special and quirky if depression doesnt exist is that why i wont leave my house do you honestly think laziness is the reason i was reported as a missing person to the police if depression doesnt exist why do i cry when i glance at myself in the mirror why am i isolating myself from family and friends why did i cut into my wrists why did i abuse substances if depression didnt exist x200b an open letter to all those people out there saying just be happy thats cute youve probably had a comfortable life with parents who loved you unlike me whose relationship with my parents has always been toxic my dad first invalidated my diagnosis at 16 by saying depression didnt exist he also threatened to kick me out onto the streets and then again 2 years after that when my anorexia got worse he just keeps me around cause i have some leftover money from school and he wants it x200b ive come close to suicide a few times once when i was 16 and another time when i was 20 recently its been on mind as im hitting new lows but i dont think i could ever do it cause im just so in love with my boyfriend though if he ever betrayed me who knows what id do i dont know myself it feels like i have no one except him and i know what men are like after being cheated on before in past relationships,pre-pandemic

im 15 and ive struggled with depression for about 5 years now it was clinical from the ages of 1012 and i think that really traumatized me i was also dealing with severe social anxiety at the time i couldnt do anything other than rot in bed sh or just cry all day its gotten to a degree now where i can function and have good days but im never really happy im always terrified of falling back i have an iq of around 133 and that combined with my mental illness made me mature way faster my best friend is my 22 year old cousin and hes the only person i feel comfortable confiding in hes the only person ive ever met who actually understands how i feel it feels so stupid and narcissistic to say it like this but no one my age can grasp the shit that goes through my head every day i also had to drop my other best friend around 8 months ago i never felt more understood by a person my age than by her but she used her depression as an excuse to hurt me and refused to change losing that friendship was really hard especially because i was in love with her i think i still am i have friends but i dont feel close with them at all one of them views me as her best friend and it makes me feel horrible that i dont even view her as a close one ive never felt understood by anybody and i just want a genuine friendship with a girl my age the way everyone else does ive felt looked down upon all my life ive always been considered the weird kid and i just feel so lonely i always feel so bad for little me who had to endure so much and as i get older it just becomes more and more clear to me how fucked up my childhood was the only genuinely fulfilling conversations i have are with adults i cant really connect with people my age because my way of thinking is so drastically different from theirs things my 16 year old friends consider deep are things i had figured out before i even turned 12 i feel so alienated,post-pandemic

i would give anything to have been born female i hate being male so much men are worth less than nothing in our society every day i wake up look down at my body and feel nothing but disgust i dont want facial hair or body hair or this huge disgusting ogre skeleton every time i shave it feels a little better but its only temporary and the hair starts coming back within a few hours theres no escape from this neverending battle against my own body i used to be sort of okay when i was younger but things are getting gradually worse feminism started appearing in the media all the time a few years ago and it fills me with hatred and rage i feel like a disgusting creep every time im in public ive never had a friend since high school and i know people think im a loser women cross the street to get away from me because im so physically intimidating and i can just tell that they think im staring at them when im on the bus i try to crane my neck to look only out the window but i can just tell they think im a creep sometimes i get so angry i just want to break things and cut myself just recently i read an article in time magazine about toxic masculinity and i cracked my tooth because i was grinding my jaw so hard with anger i hate that feminists think im privileged for this existence the only thing that makes me a little happier is to troll them online and to disprove their antimale garbage with statistics but again i always end up hating myself i cant read the news or go on any website anymore without seeing fucking feminists ranting about how they want to kill all men and now im going bald my hairline is receding rapidly in the corners and any remnant of femininity that i had is disappearing im 24 now and in just 15 years ill be a bald middle aged man and probably fat too worse than garbage i really hope i die before then,pre-pandemic
so basically my school is crap teachers dont care about me being left out or bullied half of my time here i didnt think the students did until today there was an odd number of girls today since one was off and we had to go into pairs of course none wanted to go with me and neither did any one of the boys so i sat at the side and said i was fine not doing it however one of the boys asked why i couldnt go in a three with one of the girls pairs if you couldnt tell im female and in my school girls and boys dont like to go together much but all of them said no this is a paired activity so he actually got really mad and called them all assholes and said how he noticed how they all treat me like shit and asked if i wanted to go in his pair he got a detention just at lunch break for swearing in front of the teacher and multiple small children passing by but it honestly warmed my heart so much and it showed me that maybe there is some good left in humanity and that someone actually cares it was the first time id felt happy in a long time to be honest,pre-pandemic

so over the next few weeks a situation may or may not occur where ill have the opportunity to end my life chances are 5050 ive been an addict for a long time and have wanted out of this existence for much longer i havent been in active addiction but had a small relapse recently so far using drugs has been the only thing keeping me alive but now its starting to come to a close and losing its enjoyment because of all the bs addiction comes with my mind and life just seem unrecoverable and i really am a useless addition to this world maybe things could be straightened out and in 5 years or something ill be fully recovered and able to contribute something positive but the chances of that are very low and my mind is a shitstorm sober i cant take care of myself or make any strides forwards because a depressive episode always swoops in and leaves me debilitated idk who designed reality to be like this god are you real but quite frankly its a nightmare to behold not even sad about dying tbh everyone does one day and keeping someone around if they are suffering this much is selfish in its own way im truly a piece of shit and bring everyone downam detrimental to the flourishing of friends and family or at least thats what my childhood and former years have burned into my brain ive been taken advantage of sexually abused emotionally gaslightedfucked with by my parents am socially abnormal have no skills or talents not a very high iq and have always been let down when believing there is love and acceptance in the world its a dark place filled with evil sometimes you get a taste of the light but then its ripped away because behind the mask is a demon laughing at you for being so naive the world feels like purgatory my demons have me on a leash and people seem to toy with me too how anyone finds putting themselves above others to be fun ill never understand so yeah thats the jist of things and personally im kind of hoping to be released from this nightmare before it gets worse i dont want to have a family because it will probably damage whoever is in it and im not smart enough to make a real difference in the world really nothing will be missing if there was the potential that i could help benefit the world maybe id side with staying here but thats really not the case maybe in the next plane of existence ill be less detrimental,post-pandemic

im 20 going 21 my gf is 18 going 19 she has depression and anxiety i too have had depression anxiety and been suicidal for most of my teenage years but now im pretty much out of it she is not this year she will graduate and after that she doesnt know if she wants to go to university or do someone else she doesnt know what to do with her future she doesnt see any future and she wants to die before this future ever happens she has been bullied because of her weight since she was a child and now has anxiety because of that and basically doesnt have any friend other than a long distance one she is kind of friend with some of her classmates and today she was planning to go lunch with them but the day before they all said no and after that she basically broke down thats what always happens to her every single time she tries to do something with them in the end they either reject her or say no the day before they just dont fucking care about her after that she broke down and even blocked me because i tried to help her sleep telling her she could listen to some music like i always do she blocked me this isnt the first time she blocked me she always does it in an high stress moment and then after that she unblocks me some time later she did so this time too but this time i didnt try to call her and obsess over her and she seemed upset today i offered to go out and have an ice cream like we always used to do but she said fuck ice cream and she didnt want to see me tonight even tho she invited me at her place then she said i could come and then i told her we could do nothing and just comfort her then i told her i could tell her a thing about me she said she didnt want to hear sad things and she couldnt bear the weight of another person like bitch i already fucking am but you dont give a shit about me huh but she said she was curious so i told her it was just about me knowing exactly how it feels to have an eco chamber of negativity in her head and thats why i stick to wanting to help her she then said she didnt want to hear this thing that everyone always says it and that now i bother her and she doesnt want to see me again i always tried to support her but it all is useless she goes to a psychologist but she never talks about her serious problems and when i tell her to do so she gets mad im sick and tired of this happening over and over again now she is texting me about how i only want to help her just because i want to show her im a good person and that i treat her like a poor person and that i pity her but its not the fucking truth i want to help her because she really is a nice person that is suffering a lot and doesnt know how to live i want to build something with her im not with her just out of pity or shit like that but because i really want to be with her but its getting harder and harder everytime i too have had gone trough some shit and felt like i couldnt get out of it i felt pointless and that my existence was meaningless i had no purpose in life just like how she feels now i just wanted to help her and tell her it will all go well but she keeps on making things worse for herself and sabotages herself i really dont want to leave her thats not what love and relationships are about but i dont want to down another hell like i did with other people so what should i do,post-pandemic
only 20 of men are seen as attractive anymore because every single day the list of things that only a man can do gets shorter and the list of things women can do that we cant is always growing im supposed to look at the growing number of lesbians in the world and say things like good for them or how brave but all i can think is oh cool i guess another pair of men somewhere get to die sad and alone now because thats all it really means men emotionally need to feel required useful and important but everyday we become less necessary less useful less important 75 of suicides are men we kill ourselves because we arent needed anymore some women can literally get away with saying so right at us so if we arent needed here well find someplace that does need us but only the wealthy can afford to travel this hell and theyre called pedophiles and predators for seeking love outside the country as for the rest of us death i was already one of the weaker men i was already undesirable enough but everyday being desirable becomes harder every day that percentage of men who actually have a chance gets just a little bit smaller im in the bottom percent of men maybe bottom 30 im depressed poor anxious and desperate and even if i could overcome all of that itd only make me average in a world where average isnt enough its not possible i am incorrigible irreparable i cant be fixed i cant even manage to be average so why shouldnt i move on to the next life why should i stay in a world where ill never be valuable why shouldnt i die and be with sayori my guardian angel why is accepting my fate ahead of time so sinful why do they call us the crazy ones when they can live peacefully in this hell,post-pandemic

so the first video here is an intense example of a bioenergetic release technique this is what i do when im depressed bioenergetic exercise in the second part he goes on to explain in detail the science behind why this technique may work for you what i do when im depressed part 2 bioenergetics body psychology essentially the freak out from the first video is about trying to tune out of the dominant hold of the neocortex which is responsible for our higher reasoning and tuning into the cortex brain stem which are responsible for our emotional and physical desires he makes the case that we get stuck in our higher thought functions and effectively repress the lower aspects of our psychology so by learning how to shut off the neocortex and get in touch with the neglected parts of our brain we can experience a cathartic release worked for me and i hope it helps some of you out too,pre-pandemic
for context i have struggled w self harm suicide attempts etc for years i have bpd which ties into why this all happened i also have a tendency to abuse alcohol when im sad which realllyyy ties into why this all happened im 22 years old never a troublemaker but leading up to this day i was putting myself in a bad mental spot my boyfriend had just broken up with me and i was beside myself and of course my first reaction is to buy a bottle and cut myself i was living at home and my mom and i had gotten extremely toxic with one another on this day she comes home and turns off all internet cuts cords etc which sends my highly drunk self into anger my mom and i ended up getting physical which is why the cops were called when they got here my mom and sister told them to take me to the psych ward so the officer comes to me and asks if id like to go to psych im fucking hysterically crying and saying no i cant go back there well my mind is gone at this point so i dont understand at all that jail and a mugshot is the alternative here so he ends up saying well then youre under arrests at which point i freak out even more and start begging all while my mom is getting mad at the officer saying we had a deal that you would take her to the hospital i wailed around begging my mom to make them stop i think at one point i even asked to go to the hospital instead in which he said once i have arrested you i cant unarrest you no clue if i was even read my rights my sister and mother both said they never heard him do so i got out of jail to see the bf whose abandonment caused me to spiral blocked me on everything even spotify the same bf who offered me a place to stay to get away from my toxic living situation i ended up begging him to come get me out of this house but he just wouldnt i dont know why i didnt reach out to anyone else i expected he would love me enough to save me last contact i had w him was from a texting app in which he replied that he doesnt see me as a monster and that it hurts every time i msg him and that i need to move on so he can too on top of that im now homeless currently crashing in a state four hours with someone i met on dsicord i lost everything in the matter of a week im so beside myself bc i know i couldve just gone to psych ward and avoided a record everyone in town knows the mugshot is fucking horrendous and an assault charge for hitting your mom is like the most despicable look a person could have i dont know if i can live with the shame this will haunt me for the rest of my life,post-pandemic

i truly want to change but who am i asking for help in the distance theres no one else but my very own demon the evil that exists truly only comes from my own emotions and negativity why is it that no one told me about how hard it is having to fight your own demon everyday who can i ask for help my faith is short and i am ashamed to ask god for any help the sins that i harvested come from my own emotions i feel ashamed and embarrassed to make myself seem so bright and energetic yet deep inside i have many flaws and darkness that i try so hard to eliminate but it just keeps getting stronger as if it is a part of myself i live with it day by day so how is it that becoming a part of the light is possible,post-pandemic

i got my dream job and within a year i will graduate with bachelor in arts which wont really change anything at the same time i have figured all the big questions i ever had about life and i pretty much know how it works i have accepted my past and how it made me into who i am today and i have realized my potential as a person i am healthy and hold no grudges against the world i live in the worst part of my life is long since over meaning there arent any challenges to overcome thinking that maybe my life will be better then i have nothing i really aspire to or look forward anymore i feel like i have lived my entire life i might as well end it but i am not suicidal and not tempted to die or whatever what else is there to life,post-pandemic

like the old me wasnt even that great either but damn,pre-pandemic
every girl is the same they all want one thing only money a guy with the fucking audi or equivalent and a lot of money in his pocket it doesnt matter if you are ugly if you have money she will be with you they all say they care about love and all that but they lie they are all the same only care about money i tought that she was special when i met her but she is probably same as every one else so good luck every rich born has bigger chances of having a girl then normal guys poor ones fuc you all edit i was pissed of well mostly because of the situation im in so i didnt give enough explanation i didnt know was it 3 or 15 oclock at that time somewhere around februaryshe did catch coldnonsense ignore it i never had a girl friend either of those mostly because i was always focused on my carrer so i didnt have enough time to go out or even hang out with friends because i was always shybasically im that guy in class you dont talk to unless you have to and you avoid him just because he maybe doesnt care about looks or anything else he just cares about his objective and when he completes it he instantly moves on another one he cant enjoy like most of the people can because he always thinks that whatever he does thats not sufficent but i mean he cares about his friends and everyone but he will never show it and so he finished high school went to university and thats where shi starts happening he notices that one girl in the class and he thinks about her all the time he can study he finishes some pretty hard exames while 80 rest of the class failes them but he doesnt care only thing he cares about is her why you ask i dont know why do i care so much about someone that i dont even know i jumped to conclusion that she is the same as the others but i dont want to think like that about her because i dont know her but your mind can and will play games with you i know that before i met her i waslike everyone else in their 1819s played a lot of video games a lot over 10 years of video games under my belt ps1 crash bandicot bugs bunny great games ps2 f1 06 vice city san andreas ps3 gta v mw3 especially when on first year of university you know professors iritate you so when you get home you turn on mw3 and you express your anger in multiplayer those were the days but that took some part of me i was never good in social situations talking with other people was impossible i never felt safe wherever i went i just wanted to go back home sit in front of the tv and play maybe thats the reason why i m in a fuced situation now but i know that when i met that person in class weeks were passing by and i never quite understand that i tought that o she looks great i like the way she looks wow she is smart i like that i didnt notice on time signes that im falling in love with someone because i never knew that feeling you know when i recall now beautiful dark brown bob hair on her at least thats what she looked like when i saw her for the first time back in 2012 i remember at first i hated that particular university i hated going there every day every freakin day but later on i went there just to saw here it was strange its strange even now when i think about it about this situation i could never think that something like that could happen to me for me she is the most beautiful girl in whole time and space i know there are others but i just want her no one else most fascinating thing is that there is a possibility that the same chemistry teacher teached me when i was in junior school 12 years before high school for one year and then that teacher moved to different city to different high school and teached her that girl i saw on first year of university the one im talking about in this text in her school 23 years later after it teached me thats incredible unfortunatley she is probably with someone who doesnt deserve her respect her but no matter what i will love her unconditionally because she is something special really is a lot of time passed and i decided to call her but due to my lack of courage and all those things that go with it low self esteem voice inside of my head and general bad opinion about myself i screwed up with that one phone call i mean we never talked we dont know each other but i like her i love her for gods sake why how i dont understand and i dont know my biggest concern is not that she will reject me no my biggest concern is that i ll never be able to tell her that she changed my life the way i do things the way i look on others now i dont play video games anymore and i take care of my self more then ever because of her i always dress best i can wherever i go because subconsciously i think what if i see her somewhere i want to look best i can for her i planed on calling her for the second time to tell her all this to tell her that i ll love her no matter what till the end of my life but im afraid that i ll never be able to do it biggest fear is that i ll woke up someday in a hospital and the doctors will tell me something like easy sir in your ages every movement can be critical and then i ask what ages i m 22 for gods sake then they say no sir you are 80 years old thats my biggest fear that i ll find myself in a situation like that that time will pass by like a train but i will still want to call her and tell her i love her unfortunately it will be too late then but even then i wont be able to do it unfortunatley right need to go back to explain things an a moment of anger i wrote that every girl is the same of course they arent but most of them are i cant buy her expensive gifts diners skiing or something else the only thing i can give her is my life but of course thats not important today so there you have it full story dont make mistakes i did if you like someone if you think you love them give it a go right that moment right that time for me its over i m already 80 years old even thou im just 22 but i already regret for things i missed a lot of people i see around here have problems we all have for someone this could be a walk in the part to do something like this but to me it isnt my entire life people were good to me but then long time ago something went wrong i dont know what or when but i know that when i think about her i smile and sometimes i could even motivate myself to do some things but then voice kicks in and says things like what do you want why would she be with a guy like you you are poor you will die on street and then i sometimes justgo crazy and hate myself i was normal long time agoi dont know if ill ever get better or be able to do something out of my self i live in a soso family they say they love me and all they see i m sad and they ask what is it but i never tell them its not just about that one girl its about many other things in my life but she was that one thing because i wrote this i m sorry younger me i betrayed you you could be someone buti didnt know better i never understood people around me i always tought that my life is a mistake probably is butim sorry if it means something to you i apologise for any grammar mistakes english is not my native i m sorry,pre-pandemic
maybe its me because my own husband doesnt even wanna talk to me when we are over a 1000 miles apart for almost 3 weeksi guess im pretty pathetic,post-pandemic
i have failed in nearly everything i had set out to do i have no confidence to do anything else i have no proper education no friends no job no travel experience no positive memories no good relationships with anyone no confidence no productive hobbies no self worth and no future im worthless trash at the peak of my youth the people i grew up with are pursuing their dream careers and traveling the world enjoying their lives i am sat here taking care of my needy family looking for pathetic jobs and engaging in escapism to forget that i am who i am i am 25 years old this year a stupid idiot a weak coward a life loser and a complete waste of space,pre-pandemic
i keep questioning if its my mind tricking me into repeating the old patterns or i actually like someone and the love will be reciprocated if its not what happens will i spiral down and all the progress made to just stay afloat will go down the drain i dont know how do you approach a chance at love,post-pandemic
i am a 26 yo f i have been diagnosed with depression the for last 25 yrs it feel like since birth i have been under a severe level of pressure and stress from my family i also acknowledge that i am the family scapegoat my families relationship is very chaotic and very all over the place mostly because of my dad but ever since i graduated college he has been on a very aggressive downward spiral my dad was a child soldier in his home country on top of a number of other issues he faced so he does have a number of different mental issues that he does not want to address because of that he goes out of his way to actively create chaos disunity and division in my household for everyone due to his own misery delusions and raging anger issues unfortunately being the first daughter in an immigrant household feels like ive been sentenced to jail because they expect me to solve everyone elses problems be the logical peacemaker clean and cookclean after everyone be great in school never say no to anything thats asked of me handle everything that my mother normally would handle if shes not there etc and the list goes on i am fucking tired of shouldering their issues plus my own issues plus they treat me like a walking atm i have put myself under severe stress just so i could get through school move out and get my own place just to keep my sanity because of all the pressure and stress that ive had to deal with academically spiritually emotionally physically and mentally i feel like i just continue to be depressed no matter how hard i try to do things to bring joy into my life and outside looking in you would never think i struggle with depression because i have a good job im able to financially support myself and still do what i want and i am naturally a very happy bubbly optimistic person i have been going to therapy for about two years now ive been taking antidepressants etc and nothing has worked it has gotten to the point where i constantly have to do things just to distract myself from thinking about my life and once i start thinking about my life i burst into tears and i go into like an even more depressive episode that can last anywhere between some hours to weeks i am literally crying while typing this i dont know how to get rid of the sadness that i feel honestly,post-pandemic
i feel lazy i feel pathetic i barely finished a project due tomorrow and it is the worst thing ive done in years i dont want to be like this anymore,pre-pandemic

ive been passionate about entrepreneurship since my early teen years and ive been starting online businesses for just over 2 years since high school im currently a first year college student i havent had any significant success with my businesses yet though the most profit ive made in a single month is 2500 and with my current agency im making 1000month profit which is actually the average income where i live my parents are forcing me to go to college even though i hate formal education and the thought of having to spend 45 more years in college is making me more and more depressed every day i dont despise schooling because i was a bad student in fact i was a straight a student in high school who got accepted into one of the most prestigious universities in europe here in europe 1000month is enough to rent a small apartment and cover all living expenses so i could technically drop out and live on my own since my parents wouldnt let me continue staying in the house and focusing on my business however due to that i started my first business as a minor my business is under my fathers ownership and my father said that hell only grant me ownership of it when i graduate and get a postgraduate degree so in 45 years from now a few weeks ago i asked me father if i could drop out and focus on the business if it starts making significant money 510000month and he wouldnt be okay with me dropping out even in that case he even said that if i decided to drop out because its doing well hed shut down the business i made a reddit account just so i can ask for advice because im sick and tired of dragging myself out of bed to go to class every morning it has started to affect every aspect of my life i havent gone out with my friends in a couple of months i have stopped working out despite being very into fitness and being quite jacked back in high school and im starting to lose drive to keep working hard on my business because i know that even if i do succeed ill still be stuck in this situation for the next several years id appreciate your advice,post-pandemic
today i turn 19 i must be happy right my life is all ahead and i only matured unfortunately this is not the case i am gradually degrading because my peak of life is far behind o am just a broken egg a failed experiment residue you know what i am talking about some people peak at their 30s some dont stop to grow even in their 50s but mine was in my 1013 i have always been one of the smartest and mist sociable kids now on the other hand my brain is mediocre for my age andi became a loner i still never had job in my life it will only get worse as i age because nobody will take 30 yo unemployed dude to the job if they have infinite supply of unemployed 17 yos and the same goes for love life no woman will ever love me if i have no experience by my 30s i have never kissed someone or even held hands with i dont need to get laid just someone i would care about who merely can reciprocate my feelings everyone says that teenage years are your best time in life apparently it only gets worse from here on the only thing left to do is to patiently wait for deaths sweet relief,post-pandemic
everyone speaking with each other happy and laughing i watch and feel like its best not to join in its not like ill make a difference and i wouldnt make anything better,post-pandemic
its such a toxic downward spiral my depression manifests itself as chronic indifference loss of interest in doing anything no hopepurpose in life and the general malaise causes me to perhaps worst of all turn into a bitter insufferable asshole everything and everyone bothers me to a much stronger degree i become increasingly judgemental and dismissive of others i lash out and hurt those close to me when i need them most its like im a completely different person everything sucks everyone sucks and i dont want to deal with any of it its incredibly destructive but i honestly cant help myself as im too depressed to even maintain a conversation and feign interest or empathy in anyone to begin with i used to be so charismatic but trying to rekindle that energy again just makes me come off as janky and contrived again im like a completely different person spooky,post-pandemic
my lifes an absolute mess right now 5050 split between crippling depression and some of the worst decisions possible post describing recent events post describing my emotional state as of a week and a half ago post describing the relationship i was in take this with a grain of salt idont really know where to start i guess ill just go with a stream of consciousness and try to make it readable ive been living with my parents for about two weeks now before that i was living with my now ex fiance in short i dropped out of college lied to everyone about it cheated on my fiance with a hooker and then watched everything blow up when she found out since then ive been to all sorts of therapy and on more than my fair share of medication first i was diagnosed with major depressive disorder with a side of generalized anxiety then it was type ii bipolar disorder again with generalized anxiety now the doctors back to wavering not knowing what the hell is wrong with me but knowing there is something wrong is terrifying ive had a few panic attacks over this my parents are angry with me i really really dont blame them i dont think theyre going to throw me out buti just dont know how to handle this part of me wants to just cut ties with everyone around me until i can get my head sorted out but i literally cant afford to do that my mask is back on whenever anyones around im if not smiling at least personable i hate seeing the worried looks the upset the confusion i dont like making people feel like that so i do my best to not look depressed im really really good at it i can be almost charismatic when i want to be thisscares me im really good at pretending to be me but a better me im good at being manipulative really fucking good i have to constantly fight the urge to push the bright red buttons i see in other peoples heads itthis urge isnt to fuck with them i want the people around me to be happy i want them to like me i dont want anything else from them i dont ask anything else of them i just want everyone to be happy and sometimes its the easiest thing in the world to make them that way its part of my mask it was like that with my fiance its like that with my parents its like that with my friends its like that with my therapist it is so fucking hard to not just say what they want to hear to make them happy im already doing that with my friends again its hard to be 100 honest with my therapist i dont talk to my parents about anything serious at all because i cant stand manipulating them into being happy and i cant stand seeing them upset sometimes i feel like the fact that i genuinely care about other people is the only thing that separates me from being a psychopath im worried that im genuinely loosing my marbles and that that empathy is going to go someday imall sorts of fucked up from the relationship i was in my therapist was pushing that it was a few steps shy of emotionally abusive for a bit and has backed off of that right now i think the biggest problem was that we didnt communicate well she didnt express her feelings of upset in an argument very well and i got too anxious over everything to be able to express mine very well i think we genuinely cared for each other were in love with each other and that there was no maliciousness or selfishness at play butit was not a healthy relationship the worst part is that i feel like i should miss it and i dont i have such a hard time feeling anything the last strong feeling i had other than panic attacks was when i was cleaning my stuff out of our apartment there were assorted gifts shed given me over the years and looking at themi genuinely hated myself burning hatred i broke them as best i could because i didnt deserve a single fucking token of her affection i want to talk to her i want to tell her that none of what happened is her fault i wanti want to make her happy again and i cant fucking do that she doesnt want to talk to me and i dont blame her i will not be the first one to reach out because that is not my place its going to be on her terms i dont know what scares me more that she might not forgive me or that she might i sure as fuck dont deserve to be forgiven it also scares me that she might want to try again im not sure i could tell her no if she asks theres justi did too good a job of destroying our relationship she cant ever trust me again i cant feel happy with myself again she deserves better iti just hope that if the time comes i have the fucking backbone to say no i feelso fucking empty externally i look fine ive been working out im in shape for the first time in a while i make sure to shower and shave and pay attention to what i wear i smile i crack jokes i hang out with friends ive already got a job lined up i say everything everyone expects of me the only thing i havent done in a while is look someone in the eyes i cant fucking do it im afraid that when i do theyll see just how fucking empty i am and i dont want that ive always been so damn good at pretending to be me that it scares me that its finally slipping the worst part is that i know that if i were okay how im acting now would be how i would be acting butid actually feel it i hate that im missing all of these things i hate that i missed the feeling of being in love for so long i hate that when i was sitting on the couch with my fiance looking at wedding things i wasnt really feeling the warm lovingemotion that i know i would have been its awful i want that back so badly i think i might have really managed to destroy everyones trust in me forever i dont think my parents can forgive me my friends are already distancing themselves a little even the one person i know whos been through this shit is holding me at arms length she seems like shes fighting the urge to yell at me every time we talk its all i can do to not cut and run to block everyone out of my life im scared that i might do it itd be easier at least no one would expect me to feel thank you for reading all of that itseasier to deal with when i pour it onto a page like this im not looking for anything in particular butanything you have to say is welcome,pre-pandemic
might not be good but whatever,pre-pandemic
funny how none of those people are making the same attempt for me looking back on it its kind of funny no one wants to be around a sad person so you fake being happy to keep them in good spirits and not be alone the charade works so well that no one would actually think youre suffering inside a ridiculous catch22 isnt it i was like a frowning clown with a smile painted on and now the years of caked on face paint has started to crack revealing nothing but an empty expression underneath completely blank and hollow its as if my face has been wiped away withered to dust,pre-pandemic
maybe not done but as close as ive ever been me 33m wife 33f married 11 years met when we were 19 2 kids both under 7 she never dealt with her childhood abuse until about a year ago when it became unavoidable s hit the fan when our oldest was born the wife was hit with post pardem sorry for spelling long story short the saturday morning when she begged me to take her to the er at 5am because her insides were shaking finally forced her to start seeking help yeah i wanted to leave her there and go home but they would not let me leave with my own kid and i was not going to let the county take my kid the er forced her to see a shrink before she was discharged but that just started the 5 year path to today lots of crappy stuff happened but finally she told her doc about her abuse it was to the point i was dragging her to a marrage councilor just to try to get her to open up her shrink decided my wife has ptsd so shes been on and off all sorts of pills some have been better than others but none of them have really been good im sorry but i really dont think the answer is just the right handful of pills some made her lactate some made the depression worse some made her drunk some made her manic and now the new ones make her sleep all the time we have 2 kids and she was asleep from noon to 2 then fell asleep agsin around 6 and hasnt woke up its almost 8 on sunday night im going to put the kids down in a little bit and she wont get her ass up off the couch until at least 7 or 8 tomorrow morning im just done she has never kept a job for more than about 6 months even though she has a masters degree a masters degree she doesnt keep house she doesnt cook she dosent seem to want to get better unless its by way of a new handfull of pills this isnt good for the kids and it cant be good for me im sorry but i dont think she wants to get better i dont think i can help her anymore sorry for the rant,pre-pandemic
i have been depressed for the last 3 years for many reasons check my other post if you are curious one reason however hurts more than the others i am 29 and i never had a girlfriend i lost my virginity two years ago to prostitute because why not i could start dating now the problem is i cannot get over the fact that in terms of experience i will always have the disadvantage how can i get over the fact that whatever woman i date she will always have more experience than me how can i get over the fact that i will never experience virginal love its not the womans fault its mine because i started too late i know that but recognizing that doesnt make it any better whoever i meet will already have a baggage of at least some 3 or 4 relationships this is humiliating for a man even more why me is suicide the only solution because i know myself too well i will never get over this fact so the only way to destroy the fact is by destroying the consciousness that is aware of it,pre-pandemic

i f24 desperately need some advice on what to do here my boyfriend m29 and i were together 6 months but had been friends 3 years prior to being together i knew he suffered from anxiety and some depression but in the last 2 months of our relationship its been really bad like nothing ive seen before in these last 2 months hes really withdrawn from the relationship neglecting me and made no effort whatsoever constantly pushing me away and honestly treating me like shit he kept promising things will get better and they just dont this isnt the first time ive seen him struggle with this the difference is how long this has lasted without him seeming to recover at all i made the decision to end the relationship because it was taking such a toll on me and made me anxious all the time i just found myself absolutely miserable all of the time my ex before him suffered from bipolar and severe mental illness and i was with him for 4 years but it took such a toll on me and always came at an expense to my happiness which is why i didnt want to relive this i know that i have no idea what it is hes going through and i acknowledge that i never will understand which is why i need advice from people who do understand his pain i love this man more than i have ever loved anyone in my life im the type of person who will fight the problem is i dont know when to quit and would rip myself apart for the person i love we have been in contact and its been messy hes completely withdrawn and refuses to communicate but i know this man really does love me which is why i dont understand why he keeps hurting me since ive broken up with him hes been almost angry and resentful in a way ive had a good think about it from his perspective and what he may be experiencing and i think it could be that he feels abandoned by me because ive left him while hes at his absolute lowest hes really struggling with communication so do i need to let him know that i acknowledge that hurt and feeling of abandonment i guess i just need to know whether im a bad person for putting myself first here did i do the wrong thing by ending it when he needed me the most he keeps pushing me away so do i keep fighting here or will that make it worse,post-pandemic
so this happened about 5 months ago but i found out about it this morning right after she broke up with me we had been dating just about a year and i genuinely loved her with all my heart i trusted her so much and she knew i have severe depression i cant understand how another human can be that shitty anyone willing to talk edit just found out she cheated on me with another guy too shes completely blaming it on me despite me treating her nothing but great while we dated back to feeling terrible again just after the responses to this post made me actually feel pretty good,pre-pandemic
im sad most of the time and when im not im empty ive put into motion plans that i think will make me happy again but theyll take years and im tired of waiting how do i withstand my life until its all better,pre-pandemic
ive forgotten what genuine and pure happiness actually feels like ive forgotten what its like to actually have a passion for life these last few months have been a blur i can only really recall a few days in detail i miss the old me she had so much potential she had so many friends she could actually read a book without being overwhelmed she looked healthy and prettier now i cant even move out of bed i just lie there waiting for someone to text me but it rarely happens now because either people hate me now or ive pushed them away i dont even have the energy to pull out my laptop and watch netflix now my housemates dont even notice when i dont leave my room for a week even my mother said this depression is making her life a misery i used to be so full of life but that seems like an eternity away such a distant memory now it feels like i have no one now and i have no energy to even move let alone do anything slightly productive every single thing overwhelms methe cat wouldnt eat the food i gave him today because hes so fussy and i just burst into tears im so tired i want out everything used to be so different edit i never expected this post to blow up so much and im overwhelmed by the response rate and kind messages im a bit too overwhelmed to reply just yet but i will soon know im appreciative of every single pm and comment thank you for making me feel less alone this website is very special,pre-pandemic
