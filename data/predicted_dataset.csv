i have no idea who i am what im supposed to be like and i dont know how to be myself my entire life has been tainted with anxiety and depression so ive lived everything through the lenses of my problems rather than who i really am words cannot describe how painful this feels because i want to be myself but i cant tell if im just acting or being somebody i want to be in the moment i feel like i have genetics that are doomed to fail i cannot see a bright side to any of this i think i have something like autism or sociopathy because i cant feel peoples emotions properly whenever people talk to me i want to be apart of what they are saying but i dont feel it if i were truly being myself i think id just stare at them and make no effort to continue any conversation that is started this is a shame because i actually want to be a part of conversations but its like my mind is locked off this has been a source of extreme stress especially about my identity as a person i really dont want to live like this i want to experience the world as my genuine self but its like my genuine identity isnt developed or i just extremely dislike whatever it is,post-pandemic,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1

i know i cant take matters into my own hands because my dad mom and grandma would quickly follow so thats basically murder at that point then my friends who are mainly all longdistance at this point gasoline for the fire of my depression would blame themselves and be stuck with that trauma forever thats a life sentence of misery for people who love me in a healthier and more supportive way than my own parents do my boyfriend would also blame himself he hasnt been making much time for me whatsoever at all though so he is certainly not helping he doesnt know at all how bad my mental health is to be fair but man if i got terminal cancer thats nobodys fault everyone would grieve maybe in some capacity forever but they could only be angry at the chaos of the universe not themselves i know its sick to want that when countless families are tormented by it daily but if there was a way to give my health to someone who was terminally ill and take their sickness and die from it i wouldnt think twice im around 80k in debt all in collections because i was financially abused by my ex i have a boyfriend i adore but have only been seeing a few times a month he says it will get better when he gets a house and settles into his new job and doesnt have his family ordering him around but im running out of strength to withstand it my mom is extremely abusive because of her npd and always has been and thats confusing as hell because she loves me so much but its also as easy as breathing for her to be horrifically cruel to me her emotions dictate my entire life right now my dad is depressed and unable to leave his abusive girlfriend who hates my guts hes also in financial hardship im also fucking autistic and i spent the past two years caretaking for my cruel and psychotic morbidly obese aunt who hallucinated and shat herself in our shared bathroom just for my mom to kick her out a few months ago all i have going for me is my looks even my intelligence hasnt been of much use to me because my autism makes me nave and people just use me then my looks make people want to use me more i cant even count how many rapeattempts ive narrowly escaped my biggest fear is that next time i wont get away id rather just be killed one of my main ways to deal with the emotional pain is to go online and genuinely compliment people usually other women otherwise i will starve myself pull out my hair bash my head against the wall or furiously smack myself classic autistic meltdown style as a consequence of the first coping mechanism i now have a decent collection of online mutuals who adore me and check up on me daily i feel like i do things that make it impossible for me to off myself but i still fantasize about it constantly its madness i hate how most of my love is online i havent hugged my best friend in korea since the night before she left in august then i cried so hard i almost threw up on the train because she was the one friend in my city i saw regularly modern life is so fucking sad and im financially ruined so i cant even afford a few hundred dollars to go stay with my best friend in vancouver for a few days she tried to come here but i couldnt even get two days off work i try i try so hard to live a normal healthy life and i grasp and grasp and it all just turns to shit in my hands i know that subconsciously my bf sees me as a burden because i dont have friends i go out with after work like a normal 20something he doesnt care about the money thing but i know him being my main social life bothers him im friends with my colleagues but two of them have kids and the other one is like 21 and im 28 i see people going out in groups and doing things offline together and i feel so embarrassed and weird i have a lot of friends ive worked really hard on building those relationships but they are in vancouver and miami and incheon korea and goddamn sydney australia my daytoday is mainly walking on eggshells around my mom and even if i do everything right if shes due for a blowup she will blow up at me and it could happen at any time im going insane my heart starts racing when i hear her footsteps coming up the stairs and im fucking 28 its just like when i was a child again and the finances are keeping me trapped and she keeps asking for more money and i do owe her its hell im already in hell,post-pandemic,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,1

i feel like a deer caught in the headlights completely lost and confused its as if im a bewildered buck trying to navigate the concrete road of life the lush green grass and thriving forests of possibilities taunt me tempting me to taste the fruits of life but just as i gather the courage to cross i catch a glimpse of a semitruck racing towards me with blinding lights its cargo carries anxiety depression and hopelessness weighing down the suspension of the trailer im paralyzed unable to move in time i no longer recognize myself i remember a time when i was happy before i joined the army i had friends a social life and dreams for the future unfortunately everything changed after i took that oath ive blocked out so many memories as they cut the deepest im terrified of experiencing happiness it feels like a tornado overwhelming and powerful but once its gone all that remains is destruction death and shattered foundations i no longer feel human i turned 27 last month an age where most people have a spouse children a career a family friends aspirations and a social life but these things no longer interest me when i look around all i see is evil hatred and sorrow who would want to invest in this hellish existence i know some argue that there is still good in the world but i believe that perception is reality in todays age and perception is often manipulated just like how a seemingly perfect couple may be struggling with infidelity or how some charities only allocate a small percentage of their funds to their mission i suppose ive lost all my optimism whats the point of anything if the outcome is always the same life is short and whatever comes after is eternal ive lost interest in my hobbies at an alarming rate i used to escape reality by listening to music or playing video games but even those no longer bring me solace i cant bring myself to talk to my family because i feel ashamed its as if it would have been better if i had never existed in the first place im trying my hardest to live the most nonexistent life possible my fear of abandonment prevents me from forming and maintaining friendships on top of that i think ive developed cherophobia social anxiety keeps me trapped inside my apartment unable to leave i often find myself frozen on the sofa staring at the door terrified at the thought of visitors whenever someone knocks it feels like my heart is about to explode and i immediately retreat to the bathroom for hours even going grocery shopping becomes a procrastination game for me i despise being around people and only venture out when absolutely necessary usually at night i dont feel suicidal but i genuinely wish i had never existed ive been fighting to be normal for years and im exhausted im completely worn out everything feels so draining ive given up on life and cant find a reason to keep trying all i can do now is eat sleep take my medication and count the days im just a deer stuck on the highway just a update on my state of mind bobby,post-pandemic,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0
driving to soccer practice my son told me he had planned to sneak into my room and somehow unlock my safe and shoot himself then went on to say he no longer wanted to do it he cited rejection from kids at school as the main source of his sadness but as his father i have a hard time not assigning blame to everything i can think of that i might have done differently i have personally had suicidal ideation issues since about 12 but never gone as far as a plan to actualize those thoughts feeling as though i passed a torch but also telling myself that it is most likely other factors my therapist agrees with the latter any advice for helping a pubescent 11yr old and not blaming myself for everything edit update and more info you guys this chat has been amazing thank you to everyone involved and that took time to post thought i would give more background to the situation that people have asked or talked about we learned he was having suicidal thoughts from his school my wife is a fifth grade teacher and received a call from my sons school that he had texted another student and mentioned he was going to kill himself the student told their parent the parent contacted the school my wife immediately left with her school counselor to pick him up and take him to her school he wasnt saying much and didnt give any specifics to my wife about plans just that what she was being told was true that night is when he told me of his plan but that he didnt want to do it anymore my therapist said it would be a good idea to get the whole family involved for support so we also had a family meeting with his two sisters letting them know what was happening it went amazing and everybody had a good cry and let him know how much he meant to them and how much we would miss him i also moved my gun safe out of the house to a family members the next day my wife took him to school my with her and went to see the school counselorlicensed therapist they talked about what was going on made a safety plan and talked about coping mechanisms for him he will be having sessions with her regularly we now have open communication with him about his anxietydepression levels his thoughts of suicide he says have been minimal he did tell me during one talk i dont want to die but my brain keeps telling me i do hes an very emotionally sensitive and has always been he takes things personally and rejection is amplified because of this i feel we have moved into a better space around the situation and he is doing well thanks again for all the responses they have been validating and uplifting you all are amazing and thank you for the support,post-pandemic,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0

for all the good people venting out i was the good guy in the group being the good guy doesnt help you a lot when youre depressed from my experience people would just use and manipulate you until they soak all the goodness in your heart be good to those who deserve it you are not obligated to do good youll eventually exhaust yourself and burnout keep your heart safe and protect it at all cost when you do good your heart will eventually long for the same energy but thats not the case people wont reciprocate and thats just how the world works some might but the majority of people wont and you will be more disappointed to find out that sometimes its your family and friends but being neutral will help your soul you can still be good to that person who really needed the motivation your words can heal but at the same time we can be rude to that person who made you feel worthless you can be selfish you dont have to always be good some might argue that you should always do good you should but remember that you should also be good to yourself its time to stop looking out for others and its time to love yourself for a change the world isnt giving us any favors be true to yourself im not saying that we should be the most evil villain this world has ever seen but we should aim to be intelligently selfish to understand that we should not let go of the goodness inside you but realize that its okay to let go of that darkness that comes from the void of our hearts because we will dread our whole lives and be jealous of the people that did who carelessly opened theirs you will find yourself fighting back and when we cant stand anymore we will unknowingly destroy the goodness we desperately tried to unleash unto the world because i understand that channeling your own inner goodness wont change the world but if for some reason it makes its way to an empty and lifeless soul it might change that persons entire universe stay neutral,post-pandemic,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

i just want to turn the clock back 10 years and redo everything and right all the wrongs now i cant too late and too much edit 05242020 i did read all the comments thank you this thought of regrets have tortured me so much a simple choice a decade ago still haunts me today and looms over me in the past two weeks wrestling my inner demons i lost so much weight and have lost so much mental curiosity and interest i used to possess but recently after watching being erica as some of you recommended i realized that no matter where you run you just end up running into yourself i suppose regrets will come in different forms no matter what i do or try the outcome would be the same that id be short of what i desire to be to be honest i dont know what a solution could be here but i suppose seeking it is part of that endless struggle,post-pandemic,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0

im 18 years old right now and since i was 12 i have had awful ocd when i was 14 i went through the wrong puberty and realized i was trans at 15 i just came out to my family at 18 and they were very kind but they said things such as you cant feel a gender trans people didnt exist 15 years ago i wanted long hair at your age too i hated puberty too it crushed me they think im just a feminine gay boy and i was ready to take hormones and now they are having me question everything one of my family members said im scared of how society will treat you and i said i dont care it wont bug me and she said it will i think these ignorant fast comments are awful and critical to someone with ocd im now obsessing over wether id be able to transition or wether im even trans because of them my family has always been so good to me and thats why i feel awful being depressed i feel because people have it worse than me that i shouldnt be suicidal my mom did apologize and she cried to me saying they should have listened to me and its a lot for her to process i continued to try to explain and she still just wrote it off as im a feminine gay boy my heart hurts this was all after the night i ran out to my friends car with a bag packed and called my mom explaining to her that i needed time away and i was temporarily moving out because no one was understanding me and i started questioning everything she cried saying please come home and my dad texted me saying dont do this to your mother i still feel fucking stuck being in my childhood room in conclusion i feel nothing due to my ocd dysphoria and depression i feel immense guilt for being depressed when theres people coming out getting fully abandoned by there families im tired im numb and i havent felt anything in so long and i dont know if i ever will again im trapped in the wrong body i have no purpose i am addicted to my phone and im a terrible human i just want to be ok but here i am a beautiful house beautiful family amazing friends a cute dog yet still i waist all my time on my phone and complain on the negatives i feel like a waist and i should not have been born i am an awful awful person and honestly i probably dont deserve happiness,post-pandemic,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0

throwaway account naturally lol partially just wanna vent cause i have no one to do that with so im relying on internet strangers and perhaps just at my wits end on what to do im 17m finals in 3 months and studying to be a doctor but i feel very empty and alone not diagnosed with depression and dont know if i have it but i dont know how to describe this feeling firstly i just feel terrible about feeling this way since i live a very privileged life and have been able to go private school my whole life not to say my rough hasnt had rough patches ive been bullied for being fat and appearances out of my control my older brother has a learning disability my dad also got into trouble with loan sharks when i was around grade 3 so my parents had to always work and were rarely home worry about my safety and never really being able to make friends outside of school since i was always at home with my grandparents because of this i always feel like im behind having to sacrifice everything to work hard and catch up for things i could never develop naturally through experiences like talking in my mother tongue and understanding my own culture i cant go to anyone either my parents always argued when i was a kid both about finances and my brother so i always had to act as the mediator while its better now they still argue and blame each other if i confront them about problems and convey any sembelance of struggle its always matched with i have to work as well even though i feel ive spent so much of my life and decisions for the sake of them i disappeared last summer for an evening just contemplating suicide and i got joking remarks about how suicide and cutting are serious issues for teenagers nowadays they also have more financial freedom and time now after spending so much of their time and energy just so my brother and i could continue attending private and seeing how stressed they were before i feel like all my problems are my own to bear which im trying my damn best to but now i genuinely dont know how to cope with this feeling of complete emptiness and weight in my chest its not like i dont have friends i have my close group of friends and have a decent amount of acquaintances just from all the projects and activities i partake it ive helped a lot of them with their struggles but part of me just doesnt feel like i can depend on them they just feel like mates but not people who could give genuine insight on how i feel and ive tried all the coping mechanisms i was fat so i started playing sports cut my calories to 1800 a day and got abs and now go to the gym and do cardio 4x a week ive selftaught 2 instruments starting from old rusty few decade old handmedowns because my parents could never afford lessons and got involved in productions and activities i worked hard at academics because i was always the dumb kid and bottom of the class in tests and grades and now climbed my way to trying to become a doctor i had cystic acne and tried every treatment now on accutane for a few months and its getting better despite the scars from 4 years of severe acne i volunteer and try my best to help people and repay people and be grateful so why do i feel so empty i feel like ive done so much in this short time frame and all the things people say will help im only limited by things i cant control such as genetics and time despite this in the past 25 years ive had bouts of suicide but was always too scared but in the past 2 years theyve been coming back more frequent and more vivid and more appealing and that scares me i had my fourth genuine episode recently how do i cope with this emptiness loneliness and just absolute lack of selfworth its starting to impede my studies and social life i either cant focus or the relief is temporary from any of the activities i do above ive both not pursued girls who showed interest in me and rejected a girl because i was too busy and also scared theyd be disappointed in who i really was vs who they thought i was and how terrible of a boyfriend id be i started cutting myself recently because i couldnt focus in class and was shaking even though i never had thoughts about it before i dont want to turn to alcohol or drugs cause i know how devastating it can be on my life i think i do everything for myself and all my goals are genuine so why do i still feel like this and do all these things if you made it to the end genuinely thank you for reading it all for the record i dont want any sympathy of pity as harsh as that sounds id appreciate if you could give honest input even if its harsh or just something healthy i could try to get rid of this burden,post-pandemic,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1

i dont know if this is a vent a cry for help or what but itll be a long one i was diagnosed with and treated for depression 6 years ago but ive suffered with it for almost my entire life i had treatment when i was a kid too ive always been socially anxious i hate crowded places i find it hard to talk to people i have horrendous self confidence issues i met the woman of my dreams when i was 18 we married 3 years later and have 2 beautiful children together but ive been an awful husband to her we never went out to do the things she wanted and i was really self centred throughout the relationship when i had depressive episodes my self confidence tanked even more and id cope by talking to other women to boost myself last year i did it again and she ended our relationship she was 4 months pregnant at the time and im disgusted at myself for what i did to her we stayed in contact as friends for a while i got to see my daughter regularly and i was there when my son was born ive been seeing my doctor trying different medications ive been through 4 different councilling courses done a load of self help work for the last 6 months ive been seeing her almost every day visiting my old family home to spend time with the kids we went on a few day trips shared more memories i thought things were improving and that maybe shed seen how hard i was working to improve myself and we might have a chance but the other week she told me that shes realised shes better without me doesnt ever want to make another go of it and has been seeing someone else it broke me i should have expected it because i knew shed said it was over last year but i was still hanging on to hope i took an overdose of antidepressants shortly afterwards i survived it just weve just been out together for our daughters birthday and now shes back to barely speaking to me and only wants to talk to arrange contact with the kids i cried when i saw her yesterday because shes still the most beautiful woman ive ever seen ive spent over half my life with her and i still love her i wanted to end my life yesterday but she messaged me reminding me that the kids love me i do love my kids i want to see them grow up but my daughter resents me for breaking up the family and my ex now seems to hate me for still having feelings my contact is going to be severely reduced theres going to be no more family trips no more bedtime tuck ins no birthdays or christmases where i get to see their faces first thing im completely broken and i dont know what to do ive told her ill sign divorce papers and give her everything its my fault and thats the least i can do but she doesnt want to sort that that i dont know what to do with my life i love her and i love my family i just want a chance to show them i can turn my life around but its too little too late i took more benzos last night washed down with some vodka but i still woke up this morning i want to try again later but i dont want to hurt my kids im ready to end my empty life but im scared for my kids health if i do,post-pandemic,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0

much of my depression is because we live in a society where 99 of our problems could be solved if rich people and rich countries were not so greedy i am scraping by every single day because i cant afford therapy theres no universal healthcare in my country and i have the crippling weight of student loans and poor credit ruined by those student loans so i am trapped in an endless cycle of poverty i turned to alcohol to numb my pain and its made me into a fullblown alcoholic which has made my depression even worse i cant afford rehab at all so relapse and suffer in shame i dont want a billion dollars but just being able to afford medical care and have a roof over my head would solve a lot of my problems whenever i see rich people suffering it brings me joy i know its sick but i view all the superwealthy as corrupt and evil people my country only cares about wealthy people and it makes me so angry people are exploited daily yet someone pays 250k to see an over 100 yr old ship when that 250k could change peoples lives i hate this world so much,post-pandemic,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1

ive probably been depressed since maybe 8 years old i was the youngest of my siblings born in 1991 whereas my youngest older brother was born in 1979 my family immigrated here from the ussr in the mid 80s i was basically an accidental lovechild after the fact parents had me in their 40s im surprised that im not autistic or aspergers though my oldest brother very apparently is on some sort of this spectrum i spent most of my childhood in the back seat of a minivan listening to my parents violently argue with each other its clear to me now that my father was depressivepsychotic and my mother struggles with anxeitydepression in fact i was told that during one of these volatile interactions while my mom was still pregnant with me my father pushed her down a flight of stairs in our old duplex there was a lot of early trauma thankfully my three other siblings each gave me their roadmaps for navigating the chaos i actually even consider myself extremely fortunate to have witnessed their respective teenage screwups their growing into adulthood all while tracking behind them by 12 or so years in age fck have those experiences collectively made me immune to any manner of chaos to which ive been exposed throughout my life it tempered me to be exceedingly patient understanding and empathetic it has served me as a gift for the most part ive mediated shit from rocky relationships to potential stabbings but ive also gone through cyclical drug abuse mostly amphetamines in my late 20s tens of thousands of dollars in coke and a lot of alcohol forget the nicotine and the weed im so skilled at being levelheaded that nobody has ever been properly able to see the extent of my addictions but now i cant hide it anymore ive burned through at least three meaningful longterm relationships i was evicted from my place a few years ago im living in a tiny room being woken up by my mom screaming at my dad theyre in their 70s and in decline dad has dementia mom has screaming levels of anxiety blood pressure pills and a weak heart everyone has moved out except my oldest brother i moved back in after failing due to addiction my tiny room is filled with ferret shit 2 cats and a dog these critters have been keeping me alive to be honest im really fucking lonely and depressed im out of work i cant contribute to my family i have few friends there have been a few relationships that ive managed to maintain for some time but they are either unhealthy or i outright screwup the good ones im a guitarist a producer ive had a media company in radio i am talented perceptive and intelligent when i leave the house i am my best self im sociable and charming as hell im still pretty goodlooking i interact with everyone positively i do my best to help others im a good friend to all but i just cant escape this goddamn dungeon of depression when i come back home to the filth and dysfunction that it is i feel trapped i should be doing so much better and yet im not ive been trying to do better for the last two years but it is not working im still outwardly a waste of a mind a fucking loser who bums mommys money for a schwag 10 beer many times a week a burden to my family the ones who gave me so many tools to succeed fck me dude im in a hole with every shovel and pick at my disposal to tunnel out and i continue to dig down further and further the only light i have is that my seasonal work contract should renew again in april but then i bury myself in work for a few months and nothing important ultimately gets addressed been doing the same thing for over 10 years 10 years of escapism through work and relationships im both frustrated and depressed at the same time x200b,post-pandemic,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
we all admit that our humain brain is a complicated organ so the idea here is understanding what depression is im not going to explain it scientifically you can read about it or just watch some youtube videos to understand how things work im here to make it clear for those whos sharing some supportive paragraphs thinking they help ok thanks for the efforts but its not how things work i mean depression cant be that shallow mental illness that can disappear that easily by reading posts on the internet depression is a mental complexe if that makes sense that seems like a digital virus in fact it has its unique algorithms that are complicated so that your antivirus and by that i mean your optimism can not defend you so depression is really a smart virus it attacks your security so that you have nothing to do against it or maybe you have but its not that helpful so my point is if your own system wasnt able to defeat its own self it means one thing some supportive posts wont please do not read between the lines im not trying to make it more difficult for those who suffer from depression im making it clear,post-pandemic,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

i said it a lot of times people want to tell others who are suicidal that theres always another way or that itll get better and while that might be true for some for many its not theres not always a silver lining to ones painful existence and things dont happen for a reason sometimes people are just thrown into holes so deep that nothing could get them out and there is realistically no chance of them having a good life i wish it werent true and that there was some level care from the universe to the ones who find themselves in these predicaments but honestly the universe couldnt give less of a shit contrary to what people may say the world is not a beautiful place the world is only beautiful for those who are privileged enough or work their asses off to be in that position,post-pandemic,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1

being raped and being on lexapro ruined my genitalia and its ruining my state of mind please help hey yall not sure how to start this so i think ill just get into it at 1213 years old i f19 started feeling deep depression due to extreme bullying at school i started therapy and then lexapro at 17 my anxiety decreased but i now also had an extremely low sex drive plus genital numbness i decided that was better than daily panic attacks and constant depression so i took the pill regularly and properly when i was 18 i was unfortunately raped several times by my longterm boyfriend who i considered to be the love of my life what was left of a sex drive was now destroyed now matched with even deeper depression and incredibly incredibly low self worth regarding my body and my sex life not long after that i was diagnosed with spastic pelvic walls or an extreme form of vaginismus ive always been incredibly tight for a lack of better words not able to fit a tampon usually passing out from extreme panic and pain when i tried im not able to have proper sex because of it the only time ive been penetrated was by my ex when he would rape me and that was the worst pain of my life physically and emotionally im now 19 and im in a happy committed relationship i love him deeply and hes a great partner however i find myself so depressed that i cant provide for him sexually not only for his sake but for mine my entire genital region is broken and it makes me feel like less of a woman for it i understand that a working vagina or any vagina for that matter is not what makes a woman but its the only way i can describe it since theres no proper term for female emasculation ive started wellbutrin and stopped lexapro around two weeks ago and im very anxious to not see any improvement i also start pelvic floor therapy next month to help with my pelvis spasms i understand that it can take up to three months but im looking for reassurance from others in the same boat i cant keep doing this anymore i hate myself and body and suicide is constantly on my mind if anyone has dealt with this or something similar id love to hear your advice thank you please do not tell me that sex isnt that important ive had several people tell me its okay to not have it in our lives but this is way deeper than that this is now a physical issue,post-pandemic,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

what if you are someone who has every reason to commit suicide someone like me who never had anything in his childhood then found himself stuck at a soul consuming prison thats called employment someone who watched all his childhood peers have the latest consols buy the latest clothes travel and do amazing things but you the unlucky one who was born in a very poor family have to suffer and face loneliness because you cant fit in with anyone they are always ahead of you no matter how hard you try you can never be like them you were born with a curse you can never grow when youre living in a supressing life you are never enough youre living in a turtle slow pace in a light speed life and no one is there to help or even understand you ive tried to find the answers but the more i think about it the more i be convinced that my life has no meaning and my death will be much of a better option than continuing to live a lie i wish i had something worth for me to keep living for but sadly there isnt what a shame,post-pandemic,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1
first of all i have hesitated for a long time just to write everything that burdens me but maybe it helps just to get rid of everything once about me 31 years old i am psychologically completely broken and physically unfortunately also very lediert my life has just gone wrong from the beginning and sometimes i wonder if some people are just lucky and others are not i grew up in an already broken family my mother was married 3x and divorced 3x i am the child of the second husband i can remember almost all the incidents of my childhood which makes it worse for me one of the first memories i have about 35 years my father went after my mother with a knife and even stabbed through a door with a knife he was then thrown out by my grandparents and i saw him only once a short time later he was an alcoholic all his life and did not even try to contact me even when my exwife met him by chance in the hospital 10 years ago and gave him my cell phone number without my knowledge in the meantime he passed away about 2 months ago and i knew nothing about him except that he was an alcoholic after he was no longer there my mother had quickly met someone new my stepfather he was 8 years younger than my mother unfortunately he was also very aggressive as a chain smoker he was very quickly annoyed when he had no more cigarettes and has quickly become with things around him it also did not take long and my mother and he have often and loudly quarreled often thrown on dishes on the walls he became unfortunately also now and then handgreiflich and has beaten me and my brother whereby my brother was rather his favorite since he was older and could make more with him after we have moved several times we lived in a townhouse only then it did not take long that my mother and my stepfather have also divorced my stepfather had cheated on my mother for a long time with my cousin yes it does not get better after the separation my stepfather has emptied the joint account and has filed for bankruptcy because no one could keep the house alone my mother also had to file for bankruptcy shortly after that we moved of course unfortunately my mother lost her job 3 years later and has never found a fulltime job again and lives since then on social benefits with my brother child of my first husband and 3 years older than me i never had a really good relationship mostly he didnt want to have anything to do with me and we generally did less together he was also not at the same school as me he was never very educated unfortunately he also moved out quite early because he did not get along with our mother at all and even resented that she separated from our stepfather because he got along with him he then moved to another cousin of ours until he was 18 and even had contact with our stepfather generally he was always very strange he watched our parents having sex or generally our mother taking a shower and played with himself while doing so he is also said to have had sex with our cousin according to a friend of his probably several times and has often set fire with a friend together he somehow had a kind of mother complex and for many years always looked for much older women who often also had children but usually it did not last very long when it was over he often set a fire somewhere what i knew about afterwards was his own car a garden shed a meadow and finally an attic of an apartment building whereupon he was arrested and sentenced however only on probation his last partner was 11 years older than him with whom he actually held out for 6 years only a short time later he had a partner 11 years younger a complete change of heart which was then suddenly pregnant immediately after the first child a few weeks later she was pregnant again however i had in the people 10 years very very rarely contact with my brother and we have seen us actually only when our grandparents died who have reached a proud age 92 and 94 in general i have also completely broken off contact in the meantime because after several attempts on my part no normal relationship can develop between us i can not even have a reasonable conversation with him because you just notice he seems to be very stupid i just can not express it differently about me i also made a lot of mistakes in life unfortunately for me i almost didnt focus on my schooling and did almost nothing in class my mom didnt care what i did or didnt do anyway she never showed up for a parentteacher conference either i wanted to earn money as fast as possible and learned the next best thing and ended up in the camp my goal though was to become a soldier and joined the army after my training unfortunately i got a slipped disc there and dropped out 2 years later then i ended up in a larger company where i had worked until today i started drinking myself very early 15 years because i myself had a very bad environment the city i lived in generally had high unemployment and there was a lot of drug dealing also through my education i drank almost every day after work and it was later to the point that i completely shut down 4 times a week and had a blackout several times this was no better in the armed forces was able to make the leap in my mid 20s though and quit i dont even drink beer in between anymore because i just dont feel like it i also take my other drugs although i sometimes wonder if maybe i should or smoke either i have always tried in my life to escape into some relationships because i could not be alone my first relationship lasted 5 years circa and i was married myself and had to divorce and have a son my exwife however always wanted to make life difficult for me and i got deeply into debt because of her since she among other things never completed an education just like that she quit her jobs and i was the sole breadwinner and often signed contracts and did not pay them whereupon i received debt collection letters i had to declare insolvency at some point because we also had a joint loan running i had also met a new woman half a year later and moved only my exwife really sabotaged this relationship and it didnt last long also because i wanted to see my son regularly i then decided to stay alone for 2 years but lived near my exwife again because of my son when i met my current partner i decided to finally live my own life and not always be there for others and moved a little further away got another wonderful daughter and everything looked like it was going uphill also this time my exwife has tried to make our life hell which led to the fact that i have quarreled with my partner very often and now also have no contact with my son for a year my job has also deteriorated more and more because the company was bought up 3x and changed the work climate has made me more and more broken and i had a second herniated disc in addition i was then admitted to a day clinic because i was also psychologically at the end after a few months there i was diagnosed with trauma therapy and was also diagnosed with bipolar narcism i discontinued this therapy a year later because it didnt help me at all in the meantime however i have screwed everything up i had to give up my job for health reasons although i have a gdb of 30 and was equalized i am also about to lose my partner because there is more and more crisis between us i really dont have anyone in my life anymore i have moved 13 times in my life in general and have lost a lot of contacts and friends i also lost some contacts because of my exwife i generally only have contact with some friends i met online or old work colleagues i also see my mother about 12 times a year but i dont care if i see her at all or not but she understandably wants contact with her grandchildren i must also say to myself i was a very difficult personality from a certain point and also my friends and partners had to learn to deal with it i always had the urge to somehow talk nonsense and can hardly ever stay serious about anything even when i write this text you could subordinate it under joke addiction or moria i also have a very low frustration threshold and go crazy quickly if i just drop something unfortunately im also very forgetful and often dont know what im supposed to do several times a day i probably owe that to the alcohol all in all due to narcism i often have the impression of being emotionally dead i cry in the rarest situation at all even if sad videos still carry me away i can hardly show empathy towards others i also really dont care about much and i notice it more and more that i really dont care about anything that happens apart from my children i have never really had the feeling of being happy in general almost nothing good has ever happened to me conclusion so now i wonder does it even make sense for me to exist i am insolvent i have a divorce behind me my partner will leave me soon i have no job anymore no friends and probably soon no more apartment since i then the insolvent also no new apartment more find edit first of all thank you all you have really touched my heart even if it is hard for me to admit something like that you dont have to worry about me doing anything to myself i dont want my children to have a horrible childhood like me besides for your love you are really great and i understood that there are things in life worth living for of course i will also seek professional help it is not very easy to get appointments here but i will keep at it and not give up i know i cant change my past but i can change my future my inbox has exploded with messages and i have already replied to some even if i wanted to i probably wont manage to reply to every single one thanks again you are great and stop pls

im in my 20s with children and a spouse the attempt was a few months ago and i regret all of it i recently spoke to a different therapist who informed me that aborted attempts still fall in the category of attempts bc the plan was executed up until the very last step which means ive had at least 6 selfassisted aborted attempts ive been struggling with suicidal ideation since i was a child which everyone close to me knows a few months back i thoroughly ruined my relationship with my spouse bc i wasnt talking to them about what had been bothering me and so i acted on those pent up emotions my spouse was understandably livid and incredibly hurt by my actions and while they were in a fit of rage i asked what i could do to helpmake them feel better they responded by telling me to legitimately kill myself which ofc was already on my mind but no one as close as them has ever told me that with such sincerity and conviction in their eyes so i got up and left to do it obviously i was unsuccessful and since then things have been extremely difficult the thought crosses my mind daily and even when im riled up and am convinced im going to try again i calm down and realize i wont ever do it again i cant tell anyone that i was told by my spouse to commit suicide bc that could land them in prison which isnt fair considering they didnt actually want me to die im constantly being watched bc of it and am not trusted to do a lot of things bc i attempted but the final straw that let me justify doing it was them telling me to do it it hurt that they said that i was sad and this is all on top of being livid with myself it severely impacted my self worth and its something i cant shake off but i cant talk to anyone about it bc theyll get in a lot of trouble and the fact that they keep telling me that they desperately want me out of their life but cant bc we have children together is just reaffirming that they really do wish i was dead immediately after it happened they kept saying im happy youre alive but i honestly believe that they just didnt want the guilt of telling their spouse and parent of their kids to kill themself and then actually do it my spouse keeps telling me that i might do it again and that ill selfishly leave them and the kids behind which i wont do again but to act like they didnt tell me someone who they know struggles with self harm suicidal ideation depression and self worth is driving me crazy i know that i have problems and am the one that actually did it so they arent at fault but what they said will never leave my mind i cant ever unhear it it feels like theyre only nice to me sometimes bc they feel obligated and guilty that they told their spouse to kill themselves i truly believe that they wish i had died so they didnt have to deal with me,post-pandemic,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0

hey there i male in mid 20s am going on three years since i hit rockbottom ive done a lot of work to get my mind into a stable spot its been a series of ups and downs but overall has been trending upwards never have been in a relationship and i dont see that i ever will at least for the next few years im at a point where im stable now and things are going ok but i want a relationship the dating apps have been nothing but a waste of time as i havent even gotten a single like in over six months of daily work and this of course is very discouraging and puts me in the throes of it ive kind of started to accept that relationship is just not in the cards for me that the rest of my life will consist of me helping others and achieving some success but still never seen as someone who is datable i dont usually talk about this with others but i just saw something that really put me in this position of asking others on reddit the family that lives across the street from me built a snowman with their kids and all i can say is that i would give anything to be able to do that one day with my eventual kids i have a big heart and it only seems that that has worked against my favor im a human ive made plenty of mistakes but ive done a lot of good yet it feels like a relationship is just not in the cards for me now this could just be my depression talking but on the other hand i consider what life with me would be like and whether or not i can truly provide the best life for someone i admit i am not easy to put up with at times i dont present as violent but with my depression i feel that there is some level of unpredictability and its this that makes me wonder if im doing everyone a favor by not even trying for a relationship can anyone here tell me what theyve found that has worked trying to date with depression or if my reasoning is justified for not trying for a relationship thanks in advance wishing you all the best,post-pandemic,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1

hi i hope your day is going better than mine lol ill try to keep this short but detailed enough so you can paint the picture so im a 21 yr old full time college student i stay w my mother my 2 nephews this is important bc my mother relies on me alot she has health problems i dont mind doing all the house work everything for the kids everything including getting them up and dressed for school everyday making sure their booksacks are packed putting them in the tub brushing their teeth staying in contact w their teachers making sure their tablets are charged fixing their plates making sure they are ok emotionally driving them everywhere the list goes on now ik i said i dont mind this at all but i get extremely overwhelmed especially since school started back so the real reason i came here is to ask for words of encouragement everyday i wake up ask why did i get woken up i often ask myself why cant i just be at peace w the life circumstances i was given but im not now that i gave a little back story is it reasonable i wanna quit school life back in january i was given a 2 week free access code for my school work i knew i wasnt gonna have the money so i worked ahead 5 weeks while i had the code to give myself time to get the money together i forgot to mention i used to work but i stopped when my work schedule was getting in the way of my studies and the kids i did this bc my mother said she will help me financially bc i always make sure her the kids are ok so that brings us to today that 5 weeks worth of work is up the next assignment is due tonight i knew i wasnt gonna have the money bc i didnt get my refund check and i dont rely on my mother bc she isnt reliable when it comes to money she proves me right every time so long story short i cant pay for my work so ill be taking 2 zeros which is so discouraging i want to die every single day this pushed me over the edge i would never do anything to harm myself solely bc of my nephew but im tired im tired of drowning i cant stay afloat im reaching out to ppl who are was in my situation broketired of life but pushing through for advice words of encouragement no matter how hard i try i never can get up on my feet sorry if this was all over the place but i do feel better typing this out since i cant talk to anyone im so loney and trapped in my own mind literally the only thing that keeps me going is my nephews bl manhwa,post-pandemic,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

i like feeling depressed i often do my clearest thinking and am at my most comfortable while depressed i have never really liked highly optimistic happy people in a world chock full of pain suffering brutality loss cruelty injustice unfairness poverty and hurt having an optimistic demeanor seems out of tune with the reality that surrounds us everyday to the point it is mildly insulting depression makes a lot of sense and is more inline with experience of daily life i may be a depressed person but from my perspective all that means is that i accept and embrace the sadness and struggle of everyday life i do not blind myself from the pain of modern life like optimistic people do i internalize it and make it part of who i am people with depression do not need to be force fed happiness and optimism they are just seeing the world as it really is and there is nothing wrong with that for better or worse i have made friends with my depression as my life companion and i do not feel like there is anything wrong with me i would rather accept the painful reality that life is hard than blind myself with the naive and blissful ignorance that optimistic people do,post-pandemic,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

growing up i had never really been depressed and always tried to look at the positives but 2 days ago i watched my girlfriend die she was my soul mate we connected instantly when we met at work i had currently been in a toxic relationship when we met so we didnt date until a year later but we instantly became friends and after a little bit of drama we started dating but i knew by then that she was the one she understood me like nobody else and i understood her she was good at everything i struggled with and i was good at everything she struggled with we never really fought we only slightly bickered from time to time but it was never anything seriouswe were planning on finishing college and then we were gonna get married but we decided to go visit my familys cabin in the mountains with some friends and on the way home my truck broke down we called a tow and as he arrived we all stood in the ditch waiting for him to tow it then a speeding car came rushing in and slid on the ice and hit me and my beautiful girlfriend once i woke up i immediately rushed to her but she was covered in blood and she wasnt breathing i tried to give her cpr but she was already gone and i cant stop seeing her cold lifeless face in those few seconds i lost my future and my other half i feel so alone and dont really want to live anymore i cant see a future without her in it the thought never even once occurred to mebecause i know she was truly my soul mate and i will never find anyone like her i miss her smile and her goofy songs she would sing i miss the way she would put her feet in between my legs before bed i miss how she would force me to brush my teeth at night because i was being lazy i just miss her so much and dont know what to do and i want to believe that she is in heaven looking down on me but why would god take such a beautiful and loving girl away from me i wish i had saved her i wish i had jumped in front of her so i was gone and she could still be here,post-pandemic,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
just a rant so basically i am not too sure if my problems are really serious or not 22m i always felt a little bit more negative than others but thoughts of worthless was never this intense before maybe my problems are just small and im making a big fuss about it but im still getting it checked a psychiatrist soon in about a week because i just dont like where my mind is headed thoughts of taking the easy way out pops in more and more which honestly never happened so frequently before i cant feel to be bothered with a lot of things anymore that seem like normal going out being social able hobbies etc but what really just makes question the fruitfulness of seeking help is when i was like you know what maybe its time i get some help from a professional because truthfully i do not feel okay so i booked this psychiatrist appointment and let me just tell my dad about it you know let him know what im going through so in case i seem a bit more moody he would know it wasnt intentional lo and behold this response why do you think youre so special you keep thinking about it thats why you think you have it you can go but i doubt its anything serious which makes me think is there even any value in looking for help i open up to my own family and this is the kind of support i get kind of makes me think that i cant really expect anymore support going down the line huh like i dont even know what to expect in the first place i feel even a simple okay or noted wouldve made me feel a whole lot better than just disregarding it like that guess my standards arent low enough expecting such a response,post-pandemic,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

i dont really have a point to this reddit other then the fact that i need to vent and treating this like a journal entry but breaking the third wall by having people read it and maybe respond and or relate bare with me it takes me a long time to write my thoughts out and if i reread or look at something for too long i start to second guess want to add or reword the perfectionist in me takes a life time to fucking do shit so imma just type it in one go and hope i makes sense my punctuation will be absolutely abysmal my vents are word vomit and i dont got time for grammar check lmaooo i also tend to wonder and have side tangent thoughts and internal monologue that spits out when i write or try to speak my mind basically it just feels like ive had to continuously come to terms with the fact that i may possibly be suicidal depressed forever and i dont say that to feed the narrative of like i dont think it will get better this is coming from a place of ive experienced bliss harmony peace unity and genuine joy to breath to live once in my entire life and i mean this so genuinely and it lasted for about 8months a year i know this because well i lived it and i have an annoyingly hyper vigilant mind adhd with anxiety along with depression and i over analyze every moment and whos ruminating thoughts is constantly self aware of the emotions that arrive in my body and also i have been journaling since 7 and i have always had suicidal ideation i thought more about ways to die then what i would do with my life i contribute it to just seeing everything for what it is and yes that means even the beautiful i have always been a sensitive person i felt everything especially the negative emotions tantrum kid guilty and its not like i dont try i have healed a lot of things a lot of time and life is always about continues healing but like i feel like thats a practical joke that the universe is playing on us like not only did i not get to decide if i wanted to be a dog or a goat or a dolphin like a human like the species that has to do the absolute fucking most to just function well and not die fromdeseases like humans are just weak as fuck as a species like ur telling me my own body can take me out if i cut myself and get an infection ur telling me i have to cleanse myself or i will stinkkkkk and fungus with start attacking my body and all my teeth will decay if i dont brush my damn teeth when was the last time a dolphin had to bath do laundry had to take a test and go to school and straight from one prison to the next one called work where u will sell ur mind and body and time to pay to live where every other species gets to live on the same planet humans do rent free like dead ass i wake up roll my eyes and sigh like shit another day of playing this game called life on earth its like jumanji except u cant beat the game and send all the bad things away and return to normal the bad things are there forever and more keep coming and dont get me wrong the earth is beautiful like traveling and hiking is some of my favorite things to do i dont think this world lacks in ways to be enjoyed ex i love roads trips camping zip lining etc raving more then anything im a musician i have hobbies and sports like i have tried to lead a life i would i should care for or be at least semi content with but i cant everything that is negative about my existence overshadows and out ways what ever temporary bits of bliss i obtained but also i just genuinely feel being born america let alone in new york city your already what so many people would consider a dream of a place to be in with so many opportunities like ur entire future is being though up of before ur even born gratitude is something im very present of and have to remind myself regularly but why is it that i have to remind myself constantly of what its like to feel happy yet constantly feel sadness despair hopeless ness and rage there are only so many ways u can go in life when you feel like this either find a way to force urself essentially to find ways to feel baseline but finding something that can even surpass baseline doesnt come ever so often but drugs is definitely one of them i genuinely could have been a drug addict well i have dealt with some battles in that area as well but have consistently fight for my sobriety i smoke weed but am trying the work on minimizing or quitting all together but smokeing for 15 years with the exception of times ive taken breaks some short some up to 68 month but for the same reason i dont submit to my addictive tendencies and succumb to continues substance use and taking my life away slowly or even dieing from accidental overdose is the same reason i havent attempted suicide i wouldnt want to put that on my little sister my mother family and friends and yes its in those moments u care more about the emotional damage u will cause others but not even drugs could get me to wanna be alive epically when high without a single worry athough in an ideal world if i could do acid everyday without it having any negative or long term side effects i sure fucking would that being said i have great people around me and although depression is a lonely feeling i know of so many people dealing with it in their own way and have been open about my good and bad with friends and family i saw a post that a friend sent me and the caption read this caption heres why you procrastinate the things youre supposed to care about procrastinating is not the avoidance of a task its the avoidance of pain triggered by a task if you do not find a way to minimize the pain you will keep avoiding it and my response although i did not send it was what if the pain is simply that u dont care if u succeed or fail because u dont care to live or at least live in the continues state of misery the kind that has only been lifted by very few things in life but that just serves as temporary distraction even if its something you love doing but only for the time being the procrastination isnt just about avoidable pain its putting off disappointment but also the fear of trying to define and persue what you think u desire just to realize that you still continue to feel the same its like every happy moment has underlining sadness and even if i get what i think i want or live authentically trying to find peace before i know it i realize there is nothing i can achieve that will make me care to live and thats suicidal ideation in a nut shell i rather know that i am going to die in the next few days then to know weather i continuously live in misery or force myself to pretend i dont we all just want to die a little right that is the lens ive lived with most if not all of my life but trust me when i say i still choose to keep going ive never brought myself to attempt taking my own life only have thoughts of all the ways i could ive list all the whys and why nots and also play out the scenarios as we all have done about the after math or even questioning and wanting to understand your beliefs faiths religion etc thats a whole other subreddit tho my point is sometimes we just want to know if taking our own lives would really result in going to hell or will it actually release us from the pain and also allow our soul to heal in the spirit realm the thing is all i know is that i know nothing socrates i would like to hope its not hell but i would also already be going there because im a lesbian or so some regions catholic is how i was raised believe but meee not so much and before anyone comments go to therapy or take an ssri or other medication and adhd meds ive been in and out of therapy since i was 7 and took adhd meds for 11 years and then stopped for 6 and am trying again ive also taken a pleathera of different medications for anxiety as well have tried anti depressants which doesnt give u a reason to live its just another bandaid i feel like an absolute fraud like let me pretend to give a fuck while being on something that aids my mood so that im forced to feel positively about how shity and fucked this world and this plane of existence is in other words if i could be greated by death

my 28m father flew down to visit me unannounced on purpose because hes worried of my depression now i no longer have privacy for the week or two hes staying what should i do i began a job on a new city a couple of months back and started to experience depression again after a while id hoped the depression was caused by stress on my old job and that starting over on a new city and job would alleviate that alas it seems it may be genetic and im still coming to grips with accepting that reality and accepting treatment again therapy medication ive been adamant with my parents about going to therapy and that id go when i felt willing to change for the better i told them i did not want to keep talking to them about the same thing and that they couldnt do anything about it and that they should respect my decisions on how i live my life lo and behold today my father called me to tell me he was on the city and if could come and pick him up im furious he tells me he didnt tell me because he knew i would say no the man just spent an expensive amount of money to fly down here and for what he cant change anything here either the only thing hes doing is making me uncomfortable because now i have no privacy on the airbnb room im staying at its a house with multiple guests and i cant laze around and do nothing after work as i usually do since hell just be there what am i supposed to do now am i forced to entertain him show him around even though i have no desire to do so he should not have come he did not respect my wishes and i resent him for it tldr my dad flew down to visit me even though i asked him to leave me be because hes worried of my depression what do i do for the next two weeks hes here,post-pandemic,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

all kinds of warnings do not read unless you want to read about my childhood and trauma why i am a waste of space on this dying planet and why i havent done anything about it for a long time now i have been what would be medically referred to as depressed i have my moments of joy but they quickly fade into the monotony of everything else i have no friends my parents and grandparents say they love me and care for me but i just cant accept it and im certain that my sister doesnt really like me besides that my life is better than most people dream of i have quite a bit of money my college is paid for i have all the latest technology i get good grades im not severely disabled im a whiteish male you couldnt even tell that im not straight without knowing me etc etc etc unfortunately i did experience some mild childhood trauma i was repeatedly punished never physically for small things like leaving shoes too far into the hallway or teasing my sister too much i guess i was technically hit once when the tv remote was thrown at me because my parent was having a bad day and they couldnt get the remote to work and i couldnt describe to them how to make it work i was also told a lot that i was doing things for the attention and my mother would rephrase it like maybe somewhere subconsciously you did want a little bit of attention and so i avoid attention as much as i can but i also now desperately crave the attention of my peers and when i dont get it i feel like im being lunched in the gut i have trouble accepting that anybody could like me if they dont give me constant attention being ignored is like being trapped in a white void and even screaming wouldnt get me out i believe that being told i was doing things for attention made me believe that and so i started doing things for attention another side effect of my childhood is that i lie constantly my mother might ask how are you doing and i would respond great or ok or pretty well even if i was miserable i tell them that i always take my meds on time and every day and i have even poured them down the toilet to avoid their disappointment at me not taking them i once was two months on my schoolwork and the only way they found out was because one of my teachers mentioned that i hadnt been online in quite some time that was the second time in the same year i completely fabricate stories to tell my peers but i also struggle with the actual details of my life so it all kind of blends together i like to myself when i take a picture of myself and say that it looks good i do not look good i am overweight chubby weak dirty and my parents constantly lie to me i try not to eat in hopes that i might lose weight but then i go drink a soda to distract from my thoughts i spend way too much time watching youtube it is a great way for me to get out of my own head as i can just sit back and watch another person do things that i am incapable of my reaction time is bad so i cant play many video games im not talented enough to write games so i watch dev logs im not capable of using tools so i watch people build stuff and then i watch people getting into car accidents because at least i am not that unlucky i watch a lot of fail videos street fights police chases just straight up deaths and other such things because it makes me feel like an asshole for thinking that my life was ever bad i am now on the lgbtqia floor and everyone on it had to come out to their parent or parents and i didnt it wasnt a big thing at all some of my peers were literally kicked out i shouldnt have picked this hall because someone else more deserving of it couldve used the room in a lecture today we were supposed to think of the last time we were supported validated or heard i have never been heard because i have nothing special to say i havent been validated because i have nothing to validate and support feels uncomfortable stressful and undeserved that is what inspired me to spew this garbage out now onto the other part of the title because of my twisted need for people to be happy another side effect of tiptoeing around an angry parent i will not harm myself if only to keep my family from suffering through the grief of losing a child i can imagine that my grandparents would not last much past my death as they have told me multiple times that they are only really around for myself and my sister also my parent not my mother but my father who transitioned has tried so hard to make up for my childhood and i think that if i died she would follow suit my mother would never be happy again and my sister would be even more depressed and secluded there is also the very much spoken responsibility that has been thrust onto me to save the world when i was four yes four my aunt was writing a book my sister wanted to turn bad guys into dandelions and i needed a thing one of the elements of her book was that people could take a pill to live forever i attached myself to that idea and so did my family over the years i have developed an affinity for using computers and that strengthened this idea that i was somehow smart enough to design some kind of device to cure all aging and disease in first grade i did my first ever research project on dna i went to a university and asked a professor a few questions about the state of aging research i was six years old i was placed into the highly gifted program and i skipped a grade all of that convinced my family that i was going to do something great now the current plan is to develop some form of nanobot cluster that is capable of navigating cells and repairingmodifying dna every time i question my ability to do this my parents get upset and tell me that i am super smart also every time i bring up my parents getting older they always snap back with stuff like well hopefully i wont ever have to have gray hair or im not planning on dying any time soon they have told me that there is zero pressure to do anything and that they only want me to do what i feel is best for myself but they have a vision for me and telling them that i am not as special as they think i am and that im okay with not being special would hurt them therefore i keep my mouth shut i want so badly to just be able to flip a light switch and have my existence erased from history with nobody knowing i ever existed but that is not possible haha i used to bang my head against the wall to further punish myself when i would do something wrong and i started seeing my first therapist because of that i think and no it did not feel good to write this all down i still feel like shit oh i went to the after party or my senior prom where i barely knew anyone and i took a huge hit off of a bong very bad idea i was crying on the couch for a while i never want to experience that total lack of control again but there was a point after the awfulness dissipated where i didnt care about anything and that was the last and only time i didnt go over every possible scenario in my head or worry about how annoying i was or have some song constantly rattling through my brain like some noisy neighbor yes it was illegal but that was the way of the high school i went to i guess oh that reminds me i constantly have to fight my thoughts because theyre often times awful yes this is the right time to die right over that railing it would be so fast and then youd stop worrying or occasionally it will be super fucking racist and ill feel like a piece of shit for that voice even saying the shit it does i actively have to maintain order within my brain but luckily i have a really good ability to mask everything im thinking or feeling people see what i want them to when i want them to that comes from having to mask my own thoughts so damn much i guess im like a chameleon i change my personality to somewhat match the person im taking to and i say idk to everyone i dont know in fear of having dissonant opinions i do have my own moral compass and beliefs but they sometimes take the back burner to the beliefs of the person im talking to i have even noticed that my accent changes depending on the person im talking to i guess the term for that is a people pleaser oh and when i do something that makes people look at me for whatever reason i dont just feel embarrassment i feel shame remorse and fear that theyll remember my error ok im done for now sat august 27,post-pandemic,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1
guys question because i dont understand before taking antidepressants you have been prescribed anxiolytics before i have known people diagnosed with depression who have been treated with anxiolytics i want to know your experience can it actually cure depression and if so doctors why divide depression with anxiety when so called anxiety drugs can work for depression as well and as less side effects,post-pandemic,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
i am in high school and have a sister in 5th grade she has tried to commit before and has now been to therapy and is on antidepressants i have also struggled with depression but much less extreme i have only cut myself a few times when i have gotten very angry and i have never been suicidal i overall have learned to live with it as my family does not suspect anything and i will never be asking for help me and my sister get into arguments very often because while she is treated very carefully by my family and everyone is ok with her acting out when i do it people assume i am just doing it to antagonize in our fights she states that i am the reason she is the way she is even though when we get along she admits this is false and my mom will believe it and say i am manipulative like my dad i just got screamed at and grounded because me and my sister got in another fight when she was home and my mom without my sister even telling her this assumed i made fun of her for her hospitalization which i absolutely did not do whenever i get into fights with my mom i act out violently whether that is trying to hurt her if she provokes it breaking something or hurting myself i wish my family could know that i do not act out of malice but rather because i also share problems but i know if i told anyone they would say that my problems do not compare to my sisters even when i am having breakdowns in front of my mom she laughs i dont know what to do,post-pandemic,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
how do you become a better person when youre being perceived as shitty im really trying to work with my adhd depression anxiety and disorganizedfearful attachment style i feel as though im careless when i speak like not overtly but in hindsight i get feedback that im not as careful or caring as he would like me to be even though i think i am i feel like theres no hope for me despite my attempts to fix myself however i still try and see where he comes from i am just lost it costs me my relationship i believe and i honestly feel like checking out after every mistake every unexplainable automatic reaction i have because what do i do how do i become better im depressed everyday even while on wellbutrin concerta and buspar which normally work however over the last 4 months ive been making mistakes like lies of omission to my partner and the reactions of his had been harsh but i deserve it example most serious he was through with me at this point in this past nov after he asked and asked why i still felt rejected from a date i went on 3 years ago when he jokes about it from time to time my mood would change bcz i didnt want to discuss it i told him that it was the rejection that really had bothered me he was being upset and called off his surprise engagement that i never knew about and says this is why hes emotionally distant with me and harshly cursed me out after i told him that before that conversation i had to him that i didnt want to talk about it and remained silent when he would ask me about it very passionately today and then he stated that i could not possibly be his biggest fan and obsessed with him if i still had about that rejection which is not true bcz i am after that conversation in nov i went to another therapist to work through it which i did i shouldve done this sooner but ive never thought about that rejection at any point except with it was brought up so now im just broken over this and he told me that insulted him and i never meant too and i apologized profusely for it but i cant handle them either i start getting tingly all over and my vision gets weird and my hands shakes and heart is racing with crying and hyperventilation then very heavy sadness and thoughts of them being better off without me floods in and stays for weeks but i cant tell him about my suicidal thoughts bcz now itll seem like manipulation which is the furthest thing from how i feel and what i want to convey to him but im also drowning at the same time ive been crying everyday for 4 months straight bcz im desperately trying to to unfuck this mess i made that i honestly did not want to or intend to create so this existence im living rn is unbearable but hell do extremely nice things for me recently got me flowers for my birthday and valentines day and help me and were there for each other and i feel horrible for letting him down so often with white lies and now he doesnt trust me which is my fault i had told him that i wanted to breakup with him bcz his reactions where a lot for me and in hindsight thats fucked up but im also having panic attacks and depression episodes behind my actions and this withstanding his rightful reactions ive never done anything crazy and wronged him by cheating or flirting with others or wild shit ive apologized and took responsibility for myself but im not good at explaining why i did leave stuff out bcz i feel like i dont want to lose him so my trigger reaction is to smooth out the thing with a lil adjustmentwhite lie so the stuff doesnt sound so bad but that blows up in my face how do i fix myself he deserves a lot better and i know he does i want to fix myself to be that better for him and i love him still he says he loves me but dont know idk if hes past the point of reconciliation with me bcz me being this fucked and depressed is not it i hate that im causing him hurt insult and anguish as well i just feel like if i died it would be better but the more rational part of me is fighting against that im such a fucking failure not to mention in struggling to keep the basic needs together smh,post-pandemic,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1

so for a brief background me 18m and my girlfriend 18f have been struggling lately in our relationship though before we were dating she did mention to me that she used to have depression but she was consistent with her meds at that time so she was regulated but for the past 3 months ive been feeling undesired unappreciated neglected and confused and i was wondering if i could get any advice to help me understand and support her in any way possible thats within my capacity weve been together for around 10 months now and initially we didnt had any major problem at all but it all started back in september because they were financially struggling and she wanted to help her dad lower their expenses by cutting down her meds ive already warned her that its quite risky to suddenly withdraw to which her doctor and also said the same but she persisted and our relationship began to downfall after that she was starting to become distant and being hot and cold towards me she was also a bit falling behind in our classes because of her absences and sleeping during class and there are times that whenever i talk to her she says that she often feels blank and numb but i cant even begin to say how painful it is for me to see her everyday at school being able to interact with our friends chatting in group chats and also going out in places to hangout with them and theres methough i dont feel jealous by her spending much more time with our friends i feel something much more painful i feel isolated by her often times at school i feel like im someone whos simply just there it hurts being ignored by the person you love ive approached her about it and she said that she couldnt understand herself as well on why she does so but she also said to me that one of the reasons why she pulls me away is because she thinks that shes undeserving of the love i give to her ive been reading a lot of posts here in this subreddit and one of the things ive read is that the reason why she do so is because theres less pressure and emotional investment in friendships but i honestly still feel a bit confused and i cant seem to grasp on why shes able to make brief chitchat with them but barely making any bare minimum efforts to reach out and connect with me it got worse in december as while we were out in a family tripout of the blue she sent me a picture of her selfharm i just wont describe on what specifically it was because its a bit traumatizing for me said that she was feeling guilty for falling behind at class and not doing enough even though she still got a with honors title at school at that time i was anxious as i didnt know what to do to help her considering that we were in a trip with my family so i contacted her dad along with her friends fortunately nothing much painful happened after that im the same month she was prescribed again by her doctor to return on her meds consistently like before and shes actually been progressing lately and ive been seeing improvements from her as well the school also accommodated her by giving her free counseling which has been a huge help though still there are times wherein she still undergoes through her highs and lows she may look jolly at school but every time i visit her house to come to talk to hershe feels blank and drained i know that what she shows to her friends is only a facade and in some way i should be grateful that shes able to be vulnerable me to show her true self without having the need to pretend or hide what shes going through but i still feel hurt it hurts being withdrawn from attention and affection by the person you love and seeing them being able to give it to others but barely giving anything to you but i really love her and i do see that shes been helping herself lately shes been returning to her hobbies again which im proud of and she wasnt as worse as before is there in any way i can do to be more supportive without coming across as pushy and also any insights that can help me understand more of what shes going through any feedback are much appreciated thank you,post-pandemic,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

i dont know if i want advise or just medium to vent i have been bullied by my mother my entire life physical and mental abuse was a part of my daily routine growing up or didnt help that she had severe bipolar disorder and had manic episodes everyday fast forward to last year i have always suffered mental scars as a result of my upbringing but often turned to god friends other family and youtube for relief last year was when everything came crashing down i reconnected with a friend who i thought was truly a friend to me until her birthday her friend invited a guy who came to her birthday party that was the first night he met us both but he showed clear interest in me he literally walked right up to me in a room full of people introduced himself rubbed my hand and during all the games we played he always referenced me or spoke to me or did something to let me know he wanted my attention it worked cause i waa hooked from that point on at one point the bday girl was asked to kiss the boy she found most attractive and she kissed him i didnt think anything of it because 1 we just met him i have no claim to him and 2 he was hands down the finest in the room but something in my gut felt off i stalked his ig and found that we have a mutual friend i told our mutual friend to plan a link up where he invited my crush and ill invite the bday girl sort of like a double date when we went out to this lounge it was a great time but this is where stuff started getting weird bear in mind we are all very social so everyone was literally talking to everyone we went to another place after and he offered to drive me and my friend im going to list the weird things that happened for easy reference 1 when we were walking to his car she shuffled in front of me and stood in front of his passenger seat car door this prompted him to open the door and let her sor there he opened the door for me to sit in the back weird 2 he went inside to get his hat and when it was just me and her in the car she turned to me and said girl you should be sitting here weird im soooo naive when it comes to ppl trying to son me tying back to my childhood so i didnt even think anything of it until i got home and recapped the night in my head we went out had a great time i slept with him told her how phenomenal it was but said i was feeling so guilty i hated how quick i gave it up to him and i just knew i fudged any chance of him taking me seriously i may have cried because i felt so dirty inside she comforted me shes 29 and im 25 when we were talking she says the following 3 i said oh hes actually really shy her response oh girl hes like that with ppl hes not comfortable around thats why he kept saying he liked my vibe he seems really comfy around me bear in mind we met him at tge same time 4 me i wonder what his ex is like her oh she is hispanic they dated for like 4 years but they just broke up 5 me he lives close to me actually her yeah he is building a house too but its not done yet his mom and his siblings are staying with him then it finally clicked that im not tripping this girl completely unprovoked is trying to one up me with my own crush i asked how do you know all this her response oh my friends boyfriendthe same friend that invited him to her party used to be friends with him so they would go to his house alll the time so she explained that her friend told her all of this now i immediately felt it was fishy as a girl the only reason you would call your friend to gossip about your boyfriends friend is if you are trying to match them i believe that the friend invited him with the intent of them hitting it off but the plan was foiled when he saw me and clearly wanted me instead my birthday comes a month later me and my crush have been talking on the phone everyday and building rapport i had a club party my friend asks me 10 minutes til love party if her friend the same one that invited him to her bday party can come i said sure its an open invite the entire night her friend was touching on him rubbing on him in my section this happened last year and i feel the anger as if it happened five minutes ago it was clear to me that they were taunting me but i could not understand why i jever did anything to hurt them i never did anything to hurt them or make them feel less than it still hurts honestly at one point me and him were holding hands and the friend ran from behind him took his hat and ran off in a childish attempt to taunt me further the night ended and as i am getting in my elevator my friend says your crush said i should make sure you get home safe it was yet another blow i dodnt know why they weee picking on me it hurt and i didnt have the courage to speak up my games night was the next weekend and i told my friend that her friend is not invited im starting to see things clearly my crush came and during the entire night she kept coxk blocking at one ooooh he pulled me to the side to take a bday shot she got up from across my apartment and screams uh uh you cant take the shot alone now im fuming shes getting more bold testing me the final straw was when we were playing a game and it wasnt even his turn to go but she screams crush take off your top i waited for him to leave and i called her ass out do you have a crush on him or something why would you tell a guy that you know i like to take his top off were going back and forth theres honestly so much more that happens but ill make a part 2 this affected me so heavily i soiralled into the worst depression of my life i felt helpless i felt like a complete idioti couldnt get the image of her and her friend conspiring to bully me on my own birthday party it made me physically ill triggered was not the word i felt smaller than small and honestly i cant get over it can someone help me get past this anger i have towards her i have gotten better but i admittedly still think of these events it makes so fucking mad,post-pandemic,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

ive been depressed for over 15 years now i know the exact factors which are feeding my depression but am either unable to or the depression never allowed me to learn how to overcome the ones i do have the chance to improve i probably made the worst decision of my life and decide to marry i met my husband when i had some semblance of control over my life and was actually getting better so he thought he was actually marrying someone normal married moved country got pregnant no job and now im back exactly where ive always been without emotional support because the people in my life dont actually get depression poor because were a one income household with a child and no time to even attempt to care for myself because i have to take care of my child worse now i carry the guilt of dissapointing my partner everyday and possibly ruining my daughters mental health because i am unfit to even manage myself let alone her professional help comes with bills and a waiting line as well everything just makes me feel more shitty and its just spiraling down im not here to ask for help i just needed to get this off my chest depression sucks and im probably never going to get out of this cycle i cant even kill myself and be done and over with it just sucks,post-pandemic,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1

i have always struggled with depression it seemed to get worse the moment i turned 18 and plummeted by new years my closest friends have drifted away and left me the ones left dont even talk to me whether i reach out or not every cry for help i have launched out to them has been blatantly ignored i started cutting again i can hardly get out of bed and my future seems bleak and meaningless i hate everything about myself i used to be happy i used to actually have decent self esteem but ive found that now nothing can truly make me feel pretty or good i feel like a total loser now like nothing i do is even worth it today i found out that my dad was going to be divorcing my mom after a loud violent fight over dinner my dad is the one making the money in the house and will be taking my mom out of his account and leaving us cold both i and my mom have part time jobs and i was supposed to be going to college later this year but without my dad that will likely not be a possibility for me i plan on killing myself within the next few days via overdose,post-pandemic,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1
ive been thinking i might have depression for the past few years ever since domestic violence has started when i was a teenager back then i did some therapy due to my sh habits and md my therapist said its just bc idk how to cope well and will get better once i have a positive outlook on life i didnt continue with the therapy sessions bc i find it a waste of my money and i could no longer afford it but i find that my room is often very messy empty food bowls near bed and floor scibbled notes under the blanket piles of clothes on the bed unnecessary stuff scattered on the desk etc i dont feel the need to clean because im just too caught up on life i feel that theres no time and i sleep too much i hate this about myself bc i have things to get done but i somehow end up going to bed at dawn and waking up pretty late brushing my teeth has been difficult showering is difficult laundry is difficult my mom says i am the most pathetic person in the world and i should just stop being lazy and build good habits but i feel stuck and not sure what to even do about it i dont have much energy and just dont care what happens to me the only thing ive been diligent on is caring for my dog i walk her every day make her food brush her teeth bathe her brush her and all that idk how i just do those things without thinking but when it comes to taking care of myself it feels like a waste of time everything just feels tired idk if its depression even if it is i wouldnt know what to do about it i cant even get myself ready to go to the doctor unless its absolutely a must if its not a must id rather just stay home and rest my tired body but the irony is that i do want to change my life it just feels overwhelming,post-pandemic,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0

broke my tv today and it felt kinda good let me give you some details before i tell you why i broke my tv i have the cleanest room in the house yes its still a bit messy but its a small room and not alot of places to put things so it can be hard to keep it organized and neat but still the cleanest room in the entire house im the number 1 person who does anything around here i clean the most if the house looks like it got cleaned up then its very likely because of me no matter what i do around here i get treated like shit the most anyways i had a job about 2 years ago and i bought myself some nice stuff only had the job for like a month probably lol i quit cause i was just to stressed and couldnt handle the job while also dealing with other problems in my life later on i managed to make some more money and whatnot but with all that i have the cleanest room and like to keep my stuff clean and as nice as i am able to i am literally the only person in this house that has a flat screen tv it was a 40 inch i got from a family member for 150 who never took it out of the box i have bought myself alot of nice stuff and my family is constantly in my room either just to hangout or to use my shit when i was working i often got off late around 8pm and one night i came home after work wanting to just lay down and relax and sleep but literally everyone was in my room using my tv i was extremely mad because i wanted to sleep and relax i know for a fact the only reason they come in my room is because its the only spot thats clean and where they can use a tv they will use it to watch movie or connect a console to my tv for games i finally smashed it because i am tired of being bothered and just want to be left alone i dont have a door to my room i dont even have a bed and even if i had a door i cant lock it because the power box is in my room i am dealing with alot in my life and all i want is to be able to sit down in my space and be left alone there is alot i can say about my life for you to try and understand but i am not here to type that much all i will say is i am trying to get my ged so i can get into a program and get out of this shit hole literally if i had a rich sugar daddy or i won the lottery i would change my name and move away from here forever i would give them the lottery ticket and i would only ask for a certain amount then leave without telling anyone and for once i would be able to relax and not be so stressed anymore i forgot to say that there was already a few problems with my tv and was needing a new one it still worked good to use but i just accelerated the process of it breaking,post-pandemic,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

firstly i really want to avoid triggering anything for people reading this so im going to try to be as vague as possible me my boyfriend and my two best friends have all had recent self harm relapses from what i understand my two best friends have not continued to resort to it but me and my boyfriend both have and i think we feed off of each other we both have suicidal thoughts a lot but we dont spend a lot of time talking about it because i dont think either of us are proud of it however we are honest with each other about self harming if it comes up the problem is that when he mentions he has self harmed i get the urge to do so as well because i feel that if he has to experience that pain i should feel it as well recently i took it a step further and tried a new method of self harm that left a sizable seconddegree burn on my skin and it hurts a lot i feel like shit lying to my mom about how i got it but i just cant admit it to her my boyfriend has seen it but i havent told him anything about it because im just worried it will cause the same effect for him anyways i need some advice on how to stop this whole situation it freaks me out that the relapse happened to all of my friends at the same time because i just worry that i caused it because i think i did it first and gave everyone else the idea i just want advice on how to stop hurting myself quite so badly becuase i dont often get the urge but when i do i want to cause a lot of harm please let me know if theres anything that could help me with this,post-pandemic,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0

im realizing more and more every day that im a terrible father i have a 3 year old son and we just had a second son last month ive worried before that im not a good figure for my son but now with 2 i think its become very clear that im actively not good for my sons i get angry so easy i wish i was the type of dad that was just cool calm and collective but instead every little thing my toddler does causes me to fly off the handle im begging him to stop throwing things while hes laughing at me im a fun dad either i feel like my son wants me to be more interactive than i am but im just not good at the pretend play stuff and i feel like im constantly letting him down his grandpa comes over and hes like jumping for joy at having a guy that will actually play with him its depressing and i know its not in my head because my wife is constantly correcting the things i do or the way i go about things my motherinlaw basically ignores me at this point and is more of a second parent than i am ive read so many parenting books trying to figure this dad thing out and i just feel like nothing works or nothing sticks im just not good at it a lot of days now i just try not to have too much interaction with my sons because i dont want to ruin them my oldest is so smart and so funny and i know he has so much potential to be great potential that i can only ruin i dont want him to be me i dont him to even accidentally pick up my traits so i just try to be a blank canvass and not do much with him i know thats not the answer but i just dont think there is any better one its just disheartening to want to be something so bad a good father and know that its likely never going to happen my wife is the reason my sons will be great im the reason they will have to go to therapy,post-pandemic,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

if you wish to understand the universe think of energy frequency and vibration nikola tesla the great mind of nikola tesla was referring to what we in the modernday know as quantum physics what is quantum physics quantum physics is the science dealing with the behavior of matter and lightenergy on the atomic and subatomic scale its the study of consciousness energy frequency vibration to understand consciousness is to understand reality itself everything in life is energy all matter is made of energy everything from the ground you walk on the bed you sleep in the water you drink to the air you breathe is just energy anything solid liquid gas or plasma is a basic unit of matter all matter is made up of atomsatoms contain subatomic particles protons neutrons electrons and quanta these particles are the smallest particles measurablethousands of times smaller than a period at the end of a sentence quantum physics has shown that although matter may appear to be solid when you look at it through a highpowered microscope so that it is broken down into its smallest components the protons electrons neutrons are ultimately composed of 999999999 of empty space filled with energy these subatomic particles protons electrons neutrons are moving and emitting wavelengths of electrical energy these waves of electrical energy are what we call a frequency everything you can see smell taste touch hear and think holds a specific frequency a wave that vibrates at different speeds its in constant motion always moving nothing is at rest everything in reality is in motion all matter vibrates in essence everything is composed of energy and filled with empty space but vibratesmovement at a frequency a table or phone or tv may seem like its not moving but in reality its vibrating its protons electrons neutrons are constantly moving vibrating emitting waves at a specific frequency making it appear physical giving its texture color smell taste and sound everything that appears solid is just the vibrational frequency of energy that makes it up the energy is just condensed making it appear physical so if everything is just energy filled with empty space what is reality exactly the principles of quantum mechanics explain that the universe is a quantum field a limitless void of matter and energy the field of infinite possibilities a mind one consciousness one energy at a different rate of vibration and frequency expressing itself through life the quantum field is the underlying essence of all matter and energy the building blocks of reality the quantum field is the source of power for all quantumpowered beings whats a quantum powered being any living organism with a brain the brain is the receiver of consciousness it renders energy frequency vibration its a quantum computer a network of up to 100 billion neurons working together to create and interpret and simulate your reality our consciousness is the way we observe our world everything you see hear touch taste smell think and feel holds a specific vibrational frequency everything in reality is just frequencies electrical signals received by the nervous system for the brain to process instantly creating your experience life is your own personal quantum field the existence of this quantum field acts according to quantum principles and it does and does not exist meaning a quantum field does not exist until a quantum being willed it to do so matter doesnt exist unless its being observed without an observer atoms are just waves particles with an infinite possibility the quantum field can not exist without being observed without your sensesyour ability to perceive life cant exist the way we observe the quantum field decides what we see the observer is the observationin other words our mind is not simply our perception of experiences but those experiences themselveseverything in life is youthe relationships youre inthe good and bad events you experience and the environments youre in are all a reflection of you a reflection of your mind a reflection of your thoughts all is mental your experiences create different neural connections to bring about different perceptions thoughts beliefs systems and emotions to createregulate your own vibrational frequencyyes you are energy we each have our very own electromagnetic field that vibrates at a specific frequency and your vibration will set up resonance with whatever possesses identical frequency the reality you experience is a reflection of your vibration like attracts like reality is a mirror thought is where it all begins the thoughts feelings and actions we choose have their own rates of vibrationnegative thoughts and feelings hold a low frequency and lower your vibration while positive thoughts and feelings hold a high frequency increasing your vibration as your conscious mind dwells habitually on thoughts and feelings of a certain quality these become firmly embedded within the subconscious mind the way the subconscious mind is programmed becomes the dominant vibration your programming is analogous to your vibration the dominant vibration sets up a resonance with other similar vibrations and draws them into your life positive feelings positive circumstances negative feelings negative circumstances so not only do your thoughts and feelings affect your vibration so does the environment your environment withholds a vibration human beings are tropical species we belong in natural environments citys hold a low vibration cell phone towers radars satellites radiation toxic chemicals and pollution affect the human electromagnetic field city life may have its benefits but its been associated with higher rates of mental illness it lowers our vibration and keeps energy stagnant the vibration of natural environments is conducive to our overall health by spending time outside in parks forest beaches or other natural environments or walking barefoot our bodies receive a charge of beneficial energy that puts your brain in a balanced state the more time you spend in nature the more beneficial it is to your mental health nature grounds us and surrounds us with positive energy when surrounded by nature our low frequencies start to dissipate and we raise our vibration the people the people you surround yourself with also affect your vibration when youre next to someone your electromagnetic energy field intertwines which explains why some people give you good vibes while others give you bad vibes low vibrational negative people just drain your energy high vibrational positive people just feel good to be around are you in a toxic environment surrounded by negative people who bring you down or are you around positive people who uplift you the food do you give your body the right fuel to function does your diet mainly consist of high vibrational alkaline foods or low vibrational acidic foods highly acidic foods have been linked to multiple diseases and cancers while alkaline foods have been proven beneficial for optimum health your thoughts your feelings your environment the people and the food you put in your body affects your vibration people who vibrate at a higher level feel happier positive and more at peace whereas lower vibrations feel fear more negativity anxiety sadness and poor health be conscious of your vibration for whatever your vibration is is what your quantum field reflects quantum mechanics states that reality is a unified field everything is connectedthe universe is mental its one mind you are a mind a spirit energy a mind is not confined to a body nor a brain it is shapeless formless with infinite intelligence pure conscious awarenessyour mind is not separate from the quantum field your mind is a quantum fieldthe brain is the apparatus for conscious experience the tool needed to perceive reality the tool to experience your quantum fieldso what happens when the tool the brain malfunctions

i became disabled about two and half to three years ago ive pretty much always lived in poverty and thats what its gotten me i got with a girl when i was in my early 20s and got her pregnant i tried my best with things i rushed to buy a house that i really couldnt afford for her and that was a huge mistake not only did she end up just disappearing forever and leaving me with the kid and the house but the house she wanted ended up being a disaster it had many problems but the worst one has been the new roof which was installed incorrectly ive been here 12 years now and its leaked for most of those years despite multiple attempts to have it fixed a few years ago i thought i finally had the problem solved some guys came out and repaired it and all was good six months or so passed and it wasnt leaking anymore so i dumped a huge amount of money into remodeling the room the leak had been in since i had just graduated college and gotten a shiny new job big mistake again shortly after i finished the remodel the leak came back same place it was before nobody i called could take responsibility and wed been having some heavy rains i was scared of all the money and work i put into it being literally washed away so i stupidly climbed on the roof with a tarp and thought id just lay some plastic down over it and hopefully at least prevent further damage until i could afford to have someone come back again to fix it again i fell rolled down the roof and off the side of the house and ruined my life forever i destroyed my back and have nerve damage in my shoulder i guess im lucky i survived or at least thats what people tell me i can barely walk unassisted i have trouble lifting my right arm and im in constant pain obviously i havent been able to work since then i tried for a while but the pain was too much the lack of mobility made everything so much harder and my hand shakes too much to do the intricate electronics work that i went to college for so two years ago i applied for social security disability and i was denied i appealed and was denied again i requested a judge look at my case last september and two days ago she denied my appeal as well in spite of her own vocational specialist testifying during the hearing that i couldnt work based on my condition in these past two years with no income i lost my car that i stupidly bought when i got the shiny new job and ive sold almost all of my possessions just to keep the lights on i havent paid my mortgage in well over a year because i just have not had the income and as a result im in foreclosure on this shitty home thats been the source of all my pain and suffering you would think i wouldnt be too heartbroken about losing the house considering all the issues that have come of it but its still my home i bled for this home i ruined my life for this home its the only home my now 13 yo son has ever known and on the 27th of february its being auctioned off and ill lose the last material possession i have i dont really know where were going to go from here my parents would take us in and thats good for my son but my parents are controlling overbearing spiteful and i think i hate them im 34 years old and they still try to micromanage my life even though i havent lived with them in 12 years i dont know if ill survive living under their roof again all i do know is that ive lost almost everything im miserable and i hate my life i hate the world and ive become so angry and bitter over my situation that ive even begun hating everyone around me im even beginning to resent my son because deep down he just reminds me of that one stupid mistake i made almost 14 years ago that lead me to all of this and because despite that i still feel the responsibility of a parent towards him hes the only reason im still alive honestly i would have killed myself by now if it wasnt for the guilt and fear of what that would do to him im just stuck in this miserable existence where my life is devoid of all happiness and every waking moment is filled with pain both physical and emotional and im tired so very tired i wish it would end,post-pandemic,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0

i 15f am miserable i have been for maybe 3 years now my depression only getting worse as time moves on i have not been diagnosed with anything other than add when i was very very young but i have leading suspicions for some sort of clinical depression anxiety or some sort of bpd i live with my mom my moms boyfriend my grandma and my baby brother my brother is a bit of a meanie but means well even so i often project anger and resentment against him and my mom they annoy me beyond my own comprehension and i hate that i am never not irritated with my living situation my mom is always throwing a lecture at me that i never seem to remember any part of and cannot make myself pay any attention to she is always nagging about something and i hoped to never end up as miserable as her but i fear im actually far more theyre good to me and love me but i cannot take it i want to move out as soon as i can but im even scared to do that ive been in a pretty healthy relationship with a boy 15m but its been pretty distant we dont have much in common and i dont think i was ever mentally prepared to be with someone since i can barely take my normal situation just alone ive considered breaking up with him every other day because i am getting quite little out of this relationship and he probably deserves better i am failing at least 2 classes at all times i used to blame teachers and i was right bit now i blame myself i cannot make myself do any homework when i get home i feel like doing nothing my interests no longer entertain me my hobbies are sat aside all day for me to rot in my bed while doomscrolling instagram or tiktok or reddit i have no actual coping mechanisms that help me long term i cry andor masturbate nightly just to shake off overwhelm or sadness and either way i go to sleep feeling guilty about something i cannot put my finger on i used to often break down at school or in public i still do but i find a corner or a bathroom to do this in i used to find a big joy in mornings of dressing up really colorfully and cute everyday but as i get more and more tired a pair of jeans or slacks and a hoodie is the go to i barely even brush my hair anymore its been stuck in a puffy pony for about a week with the occasional removing the band and putting it back in to refresh my hair i hate my looks and my body and i go back and forth between denial and acceptance of it i weigh 240 pounds and i am 510 i have no patience or time for eating well or exercising i miss and envy who i was before 2020 i was a gifted academic student and never had any mental emotional or physical issues i hadnt much thunk about life afterwards im weighed down by literally everything now and i feel like im in the worst state to take on this challenge im black im queer im a woman im not very attractive i talk a lot i grew up sheltered and have trouble making good friends i have no balls and no grip on anything i am an atheist by logic not by choice and i used to be a christian not bring a christian i think ruined my joy part of why i no longer believe is because when my doom and depression started i asked god to give me strength and i got nothing i was maybe 8 at the time i waited and waited and i still havent got that strength it just seems as if he didnt hear me with the war that i see everyday in palestine and the congo with my american government getting worse with my extreme agraphobia with knowing that the only way ill ever be able to get enough money to sustain myself is to get at least a bachelors innan actual degree that i probably wont like with knowing that i still have at least 6 years of school ahead of me with knowing that the friends i have now are probably not going to last with inflation being so bad i may have to work two jobs in the future with knowing that i have no actual purpose and everything that makes me happy is material or superficial or absurd i feel a resentment and hatred towards waking up everyday and simply just living i dont consider myself suicidal but i definitely do not wanna be here and i have considered it i do not believe in a god so i dont fear any concerns or consequences to doing so life is very meaningless to me at this point and i want my old life back id kill for it to be 2018 again why do i feel a sense of impending doom i cannot shake what should i do,post-pandemic,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0

attempting for a perfect moment and everything good in my life to be perfectly independent is driving me insane help idk what to do now my percectionism is opposite of most i have to be perfectly loserlike and alone and independent so when i do have a moment it is purely mine which is easy afffff when youre alone but driving me insane right now because im forced to be home since im a high schooler fuck idk plus i have to reset my school account and have a new toothbrush and school is getting remodeled and im ocd about these things happening and they have to happen now but i dont want imperfection of them however now due to missing the bus today and being driven they are imperfect and ughhhhh idk what to do like literally what do i do with myself do i give up on saving my first drink for a perfect moment and waste that on now idk what should i do give up and be in room forever what do i do bro idek if this is ocd since its only about one fucking thing but it has dragged on for like years and this specific version for months i havent showered for months or brushed teeth in months due to this one thing i cant stand the idea of my parents helping or contributing anything to me like its an extreme form of this ocd maybe idk but anyways theres this moment that ive been building up to for years life changing turn around and i had it i ran away because i lied about being with others to georgia and it was this whole thing i spent days on this and it was perfect i was like okay november first i go to gym daily never stop and do computer work and eat healthy and im no longer the same person and i can become sensitive now because im a new person and blah blah then 31st october i was taken home worrrrst thing ever like because i became sensitive and then it was the most painful car ride i mean i was seriously tweaking but anyways bro months and months of like trying to get a perfect moment again but not about improvement but just about accepting what happened and leaving this stupid in between state its been like 4 fucking months and every time something happens ive been taking it more extreme recently and havent showered or brushed because like oh my mom and dad interrupted me last time and i was trying to like erase that and act as tho it never happened so i wash hands for hours but idk anywyas today was the day i wore the perfect underwear perfect shirt perfect shorts that i was so fucking cautious to wear because i couldnt wear it on an imperfect day and imperfect is pretty much just a day that my parents have any influence over because i cant let my moment and shit have influence from them and it was perrrrrfeft i set alarm like 5 times to get the perfect wake up and set up my room perfectly the bottles on the floor the clothes and blanket everything perrrfect spent the whole week well really 3 months but my mom changed it a little prolly cause it doesnt seem important to me but it is a week ago so i spent the week on it too and ugh today things were sooooo perfect and loserlike and perfect that i missed the bus i went to the other stop but i went there for the first time the day after she did my laundry and kicked the bottles of water and i stayed up all night cause of that but anyways because of that if i went i wouldnt think hmm this is new which in turn is allowing my mom doing my laundry of the 3 shirts and 2 shorts i wore which were like perfect i wore on hood bad days and accumulated good germs on one and just omg it was so perfect and set up like seriously i have been planning that this week be the week like over weekend then monday and bam no longer ocd and shi cause like i have to time it with parents houses so like i have to plan 3 weeks ahead minimum for real but anyways i saw some other kid with a backpack and i was like ill follow him as to not allow mom doing my laundry that day affect me on my perfect day fucking bitch was a random dude smoking at 6am with a backpack and like 5 small animals around him not even a student i ran back to cut losses and make the other one but i missed that too called all my like 4 friendspeople i know with cars and ugh no one could drive me and i was literally like hyperventilating on the sidewalk or something and then my mom was texting tell me if you need me to pick you up and blah blah school is useless all my classes are either study hall or basic ass classes that lower my gpa for being standard classes and you just sleep in anyways cause its practically study hall too the only reason i go is because i have to for my perfect moment thats the only reason im not depressed its not even a perfect moment its just accepting how much of a loser i am moment not even life changing bs but i cant function in a positive way until i have it and now it will be a month maybe more because if they sign me up for therapy thats another bad week and weeks come in pairs so its another badimperfect 2 weeks my mom pulled over by me since she has my location and made me to get in her car after already ruining my perfect text conversation noise and soundnoise i hear from her tv and indirect sound which i spent hours exhaustingly making sure was perfect and loserlike and perfectly okay last night same with dad too but i dont see him today so its fine i hate them and i hate doing this ocd last words bullshit but i have to because last words before my loser moment is so important but she drove me and we were both like arguing and crying and it ruined my outfits perfect germs and energy and memory and ruined the day and therefor the weekends and therefor next week and possibly therefor my life idk and i only have like 4 outfits and this was the only grey and black perfect one and now that its ruined i dont have a perfect outfit and idek what to do because i cant have a perfect moment anymore why am i even in school today or for all of the past week if my moment was ruined like it was all and is currently all for nothing now i dont know how to deal with this it will now be like 3 more weeks without brushing and thats dangerous but i cant allow my first brush on the new toothbrush to be on a day my mom drove me to school or the week after that what the fuck am i doing now but also i dont even know if i want an answer because then its allowing something good to come from something good my mom did which i cant stand help this is a fucking paradox i cant stand being alive in this moment or day or week or weekend or month help whag the fuck do i do what the fuck do i do sorry for long message thank you so much for

so im 31m currently living with my gf 33f and its been a couple months or so now and things started out great and really fun she would go and do things with me constantly and everything seemed like it would be great because shes so caring and kind but we had some hardship come up that added stress onto both our plates but she feels she took on the brunt of the stress moreso than myself which i cant discount because if it wasnt for me then she wouldnt have had that stress but it was something we were going through together and i expressed that to her and tried to get her to see that things would work out and they did well with that stress finally through it brought up more issues of her going through days and weeks of constant depression and sleeping and not wanting to do anything at all not even work most days i tried constantly to help her through it and try to go do cute things and have fun again but she would ultimately refuse to go or say she couldnt because she was stressed or depressed ive gotten to the point now where ive had a much harder time trying to do those things because i just feel defeated and shes expressed so many times that nobody can help her that i finally took it to heart and just believe thats the case so why bother shell get upset with me and tell me how im sucking the life out of her and how she wants me to want her and feel supported and all these things but at the same time seems to have forgotten that ive been trying this whole time to do that to no avail and now my own emotional state has been altered i dont feel like im allowed to tell her nearly the amount of things she tells me i make her feel because if i do then im automatically accused of gaslighting or being reactionary to her comments and just picking a fight so i basically feel like im in the wrong and cant tell her that i feel like im getting the life sucked out of me meanwhile she wants me to have sex with her constantly but i have gotten to a point where sex doesnt even attract me anymore with basically anyone and its harder to want to do that with her when i feel so alone in this relationship having to go to work full time and then wanting to do things with her only for her to back out last minute or be asleep all day long and wake up an hour before the plans we make and then tell me she doesnt have enough time to get ready so shes just gonna stay in but that i can go out which i tend to just end up staying home anyway to appease her and also because i feel like whats the point of myself going out without her if its potentially gonna cause a problem shes on medication for major depression and has a therapist and all that but things have gotten to the point where im at a loss because i feel like im damned if i do and damned if i dont and she holds the power in the relationship because everything is done her way or she cant handle it and its her place help advice comments suggestions are all welcome,post-pandemic,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

jesus how do i even start as you could read by the title im a black man ive always been in the fight grew up with racism in all its forms in my country which ironically usually denies there ever being racism in any way the kind of shit ive heard through my entire life has molded me into someone with no selfesteem sense of selfworth voice and made into introvert because of the mentality of you need to work twice as hard as everyone out there i always saw the future as bleak tiresome and as more struggle this never really changed it just got worse with time with college and the awful reality that came afterwards ive been depressed for most of my life with my initial diagnosis at age 9 i still have it with severe anxiety my first suicidal thoughts came at age 8 and then and there i already hated myself for everything for not being enough for not being what the world wanted for failing myself at being the best for never getting anything good out of my own life for never letting myself rest or be human and with all the recent events like the absurd police brutality worldwide the rise of authoritarianism in my country with being worked to the bone and around the clock due to the pandemic with my country quickly moving up to be the worst afflicted by covid19 and my mom and me being in danger during these times by living in a neighbourhood near a place where a white supremacist parade happened which also happens to be a place where a lot of people are simply disrespecting quarantine all of this shit is just wearing me down really badly i wake up exhausted i cant deal with anything without having a serious bout of anxiety or anger outbursts followed by fullscale breakdowns im feeling guilty by worrying my friends and my mom i feel guilty by feeling tired by feeling afraid i feel guilty by not feeling brave enough to go out on the streets for my people and taking action i feel guilty for existing im so fucking exhausted and i dont know what to do i just want it all to end i just wanna go somewhere else i cant handle anything anymore edit all of this support im very very thankful for it i think ive never felt this supported in my whole life all of your words have touched me deeply im so glad you helped me i feel more hopeful more energized from talking to you all thank you thank you all from the bottom of my heart youve all stopped me from doing something terrible today thank you edit 2 wow i was not expecting this kind of response from so many people im trying to respond to everyone but i think i cant id like to thank you all once more for all your words im very glad that i vented about all these feelings here with you all i feel so much support from you and i feel like my feelings are valid and worth feeling it may seem a bit dramatic but im legitimately walking out of this with a different outlook on life i never expected to see so many people i dont know just rush in to support me when im in my absolute worst so thank you once more for being here for me i mean it i love you all,post-pandemic,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1

hi there i want to start off by saying i dont ever use reddit so hopefully i do things right this might also come off as pretty incoherent because im basically just writing all my thoughts down a little background of me im m18 having a very hard time in college not with my grades but with my mental health ive always been pretty popular and im an extrovert but ever since getting here ive had a hard time making friends i luckily have my best friend from high school here with me but she recently got into a relationship and now i feel like i have nothing my friends from high school besides one were never really great friends and i never really found myself connecting with them well i go to the gym and think im pretty decent looking just trying to give background for the relationship part of this post i think im pretty picky about who i want to get into a relationship with too i know many college students have the same issue but i feel so alone recently ive found myself thinking some really bad things im sure you all understand what i mean the only thing i can think about is how alone i am and how much i want to be in a relationship i havent had a relationship since middle school and in high school i came out as gay not to my parents tho they still dont know i feel like i have no one to talk to anymore as like i said previously my one friend here is in a relationship and everyone else from high school are also in relationships plus at different colleges i feel like i cant tell my parents sister that the main reason im struggling to go on is because i want a bf ive made two good friends since being here but neither of them nor anyone in my classes that ive talked to have been someone i wanna try to get into a relationship with i have seen one person that i cant stop thinking about and ive never even talked to them once i told myself im just gonna ask for their number and not care about the consequences this is the only way ive ever really asked someone out because i rarely like the people that im close to but im scared that when they inevitably reject me i wont be able to handle it so ive been thinking about ways to naturally talk to them and i cant figure it out im also so scared that i will never a relationship and ill mess something up since ive been alone almost my whole life now although my main issue is loneliness i also have a real hard time finding a reason to do my work i feel like my life has all been a waste as ive never experienced really anything that a kid should i feel like there is no point in becoming an adult when ive never been a kid im so jealous of people who have had fun at parties and had relationships and got to do everything that a kid should my family has mentioned taking a break from college but i feel like since i worked so hard and am going to the best college in my state i cant waste my hard work by giving up is my thought process a recent thought that has come up to me is that when i go home for summer and do nothing but work the whole summer because my friends are all occupied with their own life am i going to be able to survive that ill have no opportunity to talk to anyone my age with no school im so scared that i wont be able to continue with that even though i have so many things to look forward to i know i should really do therapy or something but i feel like itd be dumb if i just talk about how badly i want to be in a relationship and i feel like it takes so much effort to set up im hoping anyone who hasis going through something similar has something for me and im sorry if this post is rambly or posted in the wrong sub,post-pandemic,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0

hello i wanna start off with some facts about me im a 22 year old closeted gay guy fat jobless who has 0 friends and hobbies my mom is a narcissist who is the main problem in my life so i finally started going to a therapist couple of weeks ago and by now weve done 3 sessions the last time she asked me if ive felt any improvementchange and i had to say no because if anything i feel worse ive been unemployed since january 15 and i think thats whats made my life worse not the not having money part but the fact that i hadhave no life outside of the work i did and since then i have spent every day in my room im literally rotting i havent talked to my mom in over a week because she had something to say yet again that pissed me off and like usual we got into an argument but this time i had enough im tired of her and the way she treats everyone just because she thinks she doesnt need help when in fact i wouldnt have needed a therapist if it wasnt for her i enjoy cooking but i havent cooked a nice meal in a while my days consist of me laying in bed scrolling on tiktok or instagram and nothing more and i hate myself for that because i just cant seem to get my life together and change myself i want to but i physically cant ill have those moments where i get a slight burst of motivation to do something but my body just doesnt wanna get up and it all vanishes im so tired of this life i had some thoughts about suicide today but i believe that theres a lot of things i could yet experience and i dont wanna commit because how pathetic is living this miserable live for 22 years and ending it without having experienced any joy beforehand as per my last session i couldnt wait to go because that meant i can finally get out of the apartment even if it was for a short period of time and then it came to the question who are you really and all of a sudden i started crying because i am no one ive never felt loved or appreciated im a lazy school drop out 3 whole times who will never succeed in life ive come to peace with the fact that theres people who do well in life and people who dont sadly im the second type of person and its sad because what did i do to deserve getting bullied every day growing up never having felt loved or appreciated and be so miserable am i really such a bad person and back to why i originally wanted to make this post is it normal to not feel better after going through therapy im willing to give it a go but i dont wanna waste my money on something that wont bring me even a little peace at the end at the same time she seems to be a good therapist so i dont want her to feel like shes not good enough to help me but at the end of the day its about me and my needs just for once how do i go through with this closeted but not really everyone knows im gay because i act somewhat feminine and have let some things slip that only a gay person would know,post-pandemic,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1

this is my first month visiting a therapist after the first 23 meetings everything seemed to get better at least better than it was but now all the feelings came back even worse i just feel the need to sleep until 2 weeks ago i was wishing that i could sleep forever not like dying just sleeping now all that my therapist tells me feels like clichees that i already heard she tells me that its just a phase caused by my age and once i grow it will go away if i know how to keep it from becoming something permanent i want to learn guitar for example and i already have one but i dont have the motivation to pick it up and start learning and it irritated me when she asked why dont you have motivation the only good thing that i got out of it was that now i dont think of suicide that often but i still think of self harm and started doing it but very unnoticeable and i wouldnt consider it a big problem yet yesterday i had to take an exam and my mind was all over i just wanted to punch something and felt hopeless and out of place even though i finished the exam i wasnt really paying attention to it and my mood change and i just wanted to scream so i did it in my head to avoid consequences lately i also had moments when i cant think of absolutely anything so i just do whatever comes to mind all this saddens my parents but now i feel like i cant kill myself and that im just an awful person who does it for attention and cant ease their pain the only things that make me somewhat happy are listening to music and writing people say i have talent but i dont believe them and see it as a sign of leaving them alone and to not ask for opinions tldr i may have deppresion and want to suggest my therapist taking meds she said if i ever want to do this to tell her but i feel like asking would just mean i do it for attention i dont know what to do to get out of this state,post-pandemic,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0

as far as i know i havent gone a day without seriously considering suicide in the past 4 years somedays its worse than others and sometimes i almost do it i had this plan where id make it to 18 and then work until i could afford a gun and id just shoot myself but from what ive heard its insanely painful i keep looking for the quickest way to die but i never put into action any of these ideas its like theres so much to do in this world theres so much i wanna see but the conditions im in right now are making me believe i have no way out and afaik death is the most peaceful thing well about a week ago i realized that i didnt wanna die that even if i had a gun up to my head id be too afraid to pull the trigger last week i almost attempted suicide while my family was asleep but my mother mustve heard me because she came downstairs and i had to play off the situation i just dont know anymore i havent tried in school at all for years and my grades are plummeting faster than ever right now ive centered my entire life around dying before college so now that i decided not to kill myself like the fucking cowardly bitch that i am i have no clue what to do with my life i hate my family with all my guts and i hate the fact that everyday i come home to their faces i cant even live normally because every time i hear someone shout or yell i get ptsd and begin crying like a fucking maniac sometimes when i hang out with my friends and things get a bit rowdy i have to go hide in a bathroom somewhere and just let it out for five minutes the only things i live for now are music and warm baths both of which my parents hate because of religious stuff i just wanna grow up quickly and run away im sitting down watching myself waste my teenage years because of my stupid fucking family and im unable to do anything i just wanna have fun and i just wanna live but i dont know if i can spend another 3 years with these assholes i fear ill get worse and end up actually killing myself im 15m btw sorry i forgot to mention im such a fucking coward i dont know why im even posting here i dont want someone to talk to just someone wholl listen my friends joke on people with depression so theyd never listen and my school is the type with the stupid cliques so ill never be able to make new friends nobody ever listens this shit is way too long anyway aint nobody gonna read all this tldr should i kill myself while i still can rn or wait until i can afford a gun and drugs for a fader death ill try to stay awake a little longer to hear what people have to say if they made it through this stupid essay of a rant,post-pandemic,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0
as the title says i am trans and i will go back to that after i give some context to why im even posting here i have been struggling with depression since i was 13 and at the same time realized i was trans but denied it because i wasnt ready to deal with that for all those years since it started ive had very bad episodes of being depressed for months sometimes i get better for no reason then go back to wanting to kill myself i started medication when i was 15 or 16 and have had that medication up until a few days ago i have been going through the process of changing my mecidatiom and now im off meds and im pretty sure all of you know thats a slow process today i start in a new school and have to move to a dorm because the school is in a different city im already stressef because firstly i dont have any strenght or motivation to study and now comes the part about me being trans i came out to my mom stepdad and sibling when i was 15 and my dad and stepmom when i was 16 but i havent told an irl friend i will be going to the sale school with and i dont want to but if i dont tell her and explain why i want to be called something else then my deadname i will have to be deadnamed and misgendered by the teachers and that friend for the next 23 years if anyone here is trans im sure they know that doesnt feel nice to be closeted just bc youre scared or dont have the strength to deal with the possible outcomes of peoples reactions and so on i also have social anxiety and never really had friends irl atleast not ones that stayed or even cared about me since ive struggled with that i cant risk losing an only irl friend by coming out i dont want to be alone at school anymore been bullied since i was 7 up until i was 15 so i dont want any more of that or having to sit alone or eat alone last school i was at i had some sort of friends but not those kinda people that i would come out to or even talk to after school and i didnt i am extremly depressed right now i have been through so much shit and rn while being on the damn edge and trying not to end my life i dont have the strenght for any of this i rather just pass away i dont want anyone to worry as im not planning anything but i really need some support,post-pandemic,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0

over 2 years ago i met a woman id eventually fall in love with the both of us have pasts where people we cared about both family and loved ones hurt us in ways most people dont experience she however is married so i knew the relationship wouldnt go anywhere and at first i was ok with that as her husband seemed like a good man neglectful but better than those that abused her before everything changed when i found out from her by accident that she has lived in her current home for 10 years that info itself isnt bad unless you know her age is 26 at the time and he is 33 or 34 after i stumble with the news and she tells me to ask her and shell explain the confirmation comes out she was living with a 24 year old man when she was 16 after i call it as it is grooming she rambles on and insults me to make the situation seem not as bad somehow she thought telling me they met when she was 10 and she didnt know how old he was would make sense or change anything i try to move on from the issue for the sake of our friendship but i hold a deep resentment for the husband now she gets fired from both of her jobs and i help her get a job where i work at she volunteers for a training detail where she has to wear a specific uniform where she asks me for help and i spend almost 1k dollars to help her get it in this attempt to be there for her she treats me like a delivery boy 1 day shes working from home and i tell her ill give her the uniform the next day we both go into the office she says i can drop it off at her place instead1st time going to her house when i get close she tells me to just drop it off at the front door i ask if she isnt home and she says she is but doesnt want to open the door this genuinely pisses me off and i tell her that she is wrong for it as i am not her personal ups driver simply greeting me at the door is all she couldve done yet again for the sake of our friendship i let it go but i do not forgive this time her birthday comes up and i make sure the office does a suprise for her as none of them wanted to do it when i asked a few days later my whole world is turned upside down and today i am unemployed and went to a different state as i had thoughts of suicide my job falsely made a claim go police that i was going to kill someone i hold dear they fired me even after the police and the hospital concluded it was all a misunderstanding and my boss made a error in judgement and a friend of ours tells me that she was thinking of putting a restraining order on me which completely broke my heartit was more false information as id find out from her that her parents wanted a restraining order she didnt as the whole situation seemed bizarre if anyone wants to know more please ask im not seeking advice as ive already cut her off from my life in december unbiased opinions is what id like,post-pandemic,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

this is long but i need advice badly since the start of the relationship hes been lovely i even thought i was being love bombed for a couple months until i accepted that he was really just a clingy loving partner that would get me flowers monthly and i loved it some months into it i had some situations arise that led me down a dark rough patch that i even had to drop my psychiatrist because they were basically throwing pills at me and i was not getting better and even lost my job because the side effects made me nonfunctional so i took it upon myself to get better again and once i had a stable job i got a new psychiatrist and theyve been heaven sent the months i was doing better my boyfriend was getting way more out of control and would talk about how he was going to quit living almost weekly during this time i would drive over to his house in the middle of the night and stay with him for days at least weekly or every two weeks even when this involved me not being able to sleep and having to drive 1h30m to work in the mornings i was giving my all to save him and show him how loved he was and still he would tell me i wasnt enough and that he was really going to do it i was patient i would stay by his side no matter what take hour long breaks at work to hear him vent on the phone i would miss my training classes and drive back to his house after work i just wanted him to feel better and i did all of this because when i was the one going through a hard time he didnt break up me even when he would constantly say he couldnt take it anymore as in being with me he claims ive been pushing him away since midjanuary weve gone on coffee dates almost every weekend as usual because he loves coffee but ive been struggling a lot to sleep and that has me in a bitter mood sometimes ive asked for us to do couple activities like painting going on walks and he says he will but then claims he doesnt want to or that the things i want to do are silly the last thing i asked for was to pause our sleepover weekends in order to sleep with him i would have to take pills quite late because i had to wait for him to finish gaming and be ready to go to bed for me to be allowed to sleep and he wakes up so early that it was impossible for me to have 7 hours a night this made me hate sleeping over but i explained that i still liked spending the day with him he said fine and that this was even more proof that i was tired of him and didnt want to be with him anymore which is not true for valentines day he didnt get me nothing he said it was because he didnt have money after he spent it on videogames the week before and i have never spent a dime on a gift for him nor expect him to do so i write him letters and he knows i love that too also supermarket flowers are cheap and he used to get me those all the time last night he told me that he wasnt happy in the relationship anymore and that him being an empath i was making him feel depressed even while on antidepressants and that he doesnt know what more to do i gave him a back massage since he said he wanted intimacy but i didnt feel like having sex after giving in to having sex while we were doing it he told me that he would feel relieved if i broke up with him but he didnt want to be without me he doesnt want to be depressed again because of me and i told him that it was ultimately his decision if he wanted in or not but i didnt want to break up and i was not going to unless he specifically broke up with me i told him that i would understand if he did im not forcing him to suffer and hes free to leave anytime i would heal myself from his decision he didnt break up with me since i said i would see my doctor earlier and that i would restrain from talking to him about my mental issues unless it was good news he was fine with this and went to sleep this morning it was like nothing had happened and we were good again i put on my best act as if i was happy and he went on with it i asked again if he was sure he wanted to stay with me and he said that yes because he loves me but if i dont get better hes leaving me for a moment i forgot how sad i was and felt connected to him again and now im back home and feeling everything again and feeling like once again im doing all just to stay in the relationship i still dont have flowers im using up all my savings to pay for the doctor and the medication before i get my paycheck and i dont know if im capable of acting fine for who knows how long after doing it for months to not make him feel bad for going through an episode i dont know how to move forward i dont want to break up because the good times are really good and i dont see myself finding love again after this i have no one to talk about this ive grown distant from all my friends because all the free time i have would go to him i feel stuck i cant be alone again,post-pandemic,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

ive never posted anything online before so ill try to be succinct im 43 male never married no kids on medical leave from my job for depression im so disappointed in the person ive become no matter how much i read or do its like i have not gained any wisdom on managing lifes challenges i grew up in a loving home with lots of encouragement and high expectations i was an a student through college but my social skills have always been lacking i managed to work for the past 20 years but i couldnt keep up in my current job hence the medical leave ive been in therapy for much of the past 10 years my psychologist believes i have traits of avoidant personality disorder i take several antidepressants and im currently two weeks into tms therapy nothing seems to help im unbelievably critical of myself even now as i write this message i am certain that this will be the worst written message ever on reddit ive been reading hundreds of other posts and they seem so well written im even more amazed by the responses how are you all able to find the words to share your wisdom and advice i read everything i can find on overcoming depression and avoiding suicide but it goes right through me and outv the other end with nothing retained i cant imagine giving advice to someone there is so little i can think of to say to people in distress im a mess right now i have lost hope of getting better i dont exercise i sleep 14 hours a day i have a house but i spend most nights at my parents nothing traumatic has ever really happened to me the worst thing is that my exgirlfriend cheated on me three years ago and i havent dated since i have some solid friends that ive known since high school they are all very well adjusted and have careers and families of their own i cant seem to learn anything these days i used to be smart but i am not longer able to learn new things i cant imagine surviving another 40 years i think about volunteering but i even tell myself that i have nothing valuable to offer ive no real skills to rely on i have saved about 300k in my 20 years of work i had saved that money so that i could support having a family some day i no longer think im capable of having a family too overwhelming i would be an awful spouse and father i dont plan to go back to work i plan to just live on my savings as long as i can and then end my life by then my parents will be gone and i wont hurt them my siblings and friends will be hurt in the nearterm but they will be ok in the long run ive read so much on coping with this disease but so little spurs me to action until last year im was microdosing with weed every morning to get myself going keeping up with job and social occasions the weed stopped working for me though now if i smoke it gives me some paranoia that makes things worse thanks for reading all this i love you,post-pandemic,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0

if you google reasons to live they pretty much all say that they carry on living because they dont want to cause pain to their loved ones i have very little loved ones and i cant express enough how little i give a shit about how sad theyre gonna be when i kill myself there is no way they will feel as terrible as i do everyday at least have the ability to get over it whereas i am condemned to this suffering until i die some other way i think about how my girlfriend will feel if she finds out ive killed myself and i just do not care i love more than anything even more than myself but i want death so badly that there is nothing that convince not to do it now my mum dad brother grandad grandma and literally everybody in my family will be devastated beyond words and i am fine with that because i will have victory for once i will fixed it at the greatest possible cost and im glad their sadness is of no concern of mine when im fucking dead i do not enjoy living as i have stated in other posts i dont care about the little things in life the smell of freshly cut grass isnt a valid reason to fucking live you jackass i may laugh at things that are funny and may enjoy making others laugh and enjoy the company and love of my girlfriend but it just isnt enough i need some other way of relief of my problems if not suicide i am not fucking willing to put in any hard work because i could just kill myself lol i need a giant stroke of luck or a huge incredibly forgiving second chance that will just make everything go away i wish all my problems could just be fixed by some miracle solution and they all say its just hard work that will fix it but no pal its suicide and its a legitimate solution it ends my problems and thats all i want im quite frankly sur people arent just okay with people suicide and that it doesnt happen even more than it does its just such an absolute and perfect solution for everything the only reason people stop is because they feel obligated to others but i just dont have that filter i feel oddly free in the solace that suicide gives me whenever a new problem arises it doesnt affect me anymore because i know that one day i wont have to deal with this shit because ill be dead and buried,post-pandemic,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,1

so to give a background i have been on a reasonably high dose of parnate augmented with seroquel for a couple of years now which has dulled my depression but not put it in remission my psychiatrist has now put me onto lithium to augment my two previous medications and i am stuck with two thoughts in my mind x200b 1 to me it feels right that i am now on 3 psychotropics like it matches how broken i feel like i am especially since once is an maoi with all the risk of side affects and now with lithium that seemingly is destined to do damage over a long term definitely will be long term as well my psychiatrist has advised that due to the history of depressive episodes and the severity of my current one that tapering off is extremely unlikely 2 while it is early days with lithium i kind of feel like it is having an effect then i think about what if it does put the depression into remission my current episode has been going since 2019 internally part of the way i define myself is as someone with depression almost feels like i would lose part of who i am the second thought is the one primarily troubling me it seems so preverse but i am almost scared of the idea of remission,post-pandemic,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

ive been researching this topic for a while now and every study seems to give a different answer many say there is no link between porn and depression other studies claim that a porn addiction lowers dopamine levels causing depression i just want a straight answer on this for me i started watching when i was 20 and have been on it for a year and a half now for the 19 years of my life before it i felt great never had depression and at most very minimal anxiety i even went through a tough breakup and while i was sad would never consider myself depressed one day when i was very bored i decided to watch porn and no more than two months later i started to feel sad depressed and not like myself for the last year and a half ive found myself getting bored easily and it takes so much more for me to feel good before porn simple things like playing sports going on a walk or listening to music made me feel so good now it feels like i need a high dopamine activity like going on a date or thrill seeking to feel good again ive just had a foggy mind soon after i started im trying to quit porn but it has been a challenge with many relapses im just looking to know if porn addiction cause depression is a coping mechanism or both,post-pandemic,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

just one year ago i was actually happy maybe not everyday but i was content and honestly looking forward to the future but today i just sit here typing feeling like there is a hole in my chest that cant be filled nothings changed in my life besides a rough break up but that break up made me take a good look at myself and realize all of my awful flaws i had and i thought that maybe if i found a new gf and fixed my flaws then perhaps the hole could be filled but i know its untrue because a relationship and character development would only distract me from the problems but not fix them yet now everyday is just waking up to either crying or having nothing exciting me even if the day is filled with fun activities the excitement and joy in my life is gone i feel like an outcast who will never truly find connection or love ever again im just this soul doomed to be alone because no one will ever understand or want connect with me on a deeper level the is no point to me and there has never been ive always just been floating down the river of life and its all i hear you have to try new hobbies you have to get more sunlight you have to make yourself more interesting so people want to be your friend why cant someone including myself just accept me for who i am right now no amount of changing or investing in this body of mine is worth it because this life will never be enough for myself or anyone else im so tired of the routine and the bullshit and everyone just telling me how to live everything is just boring now i just want to curl up into a ball and wither away,post-pandemic,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

i am having a lot of trouble with maintaining and keeping friends i am an individual with a slew of issues which are comorbid with depression such as bipolar and autism spectrum disorder that are contextually relevant for certain behaviors which is why i mention it anyways lately i have been feeling extremely low and have been going through a deep deep depressive phase it started getting to the point where i did not care about what anyone was saying to me and i started acting selfdestructive telling my close friends that i did not care about myself or my life anymore and i wanted to hurt myself i guess i became so detached that it didnt mean anything to me anymore most of these things said were during periods of drinking at a particular party last week i became incredibly drunk and intoxicated and i told my best friend that i felt like basically he doesnt care about me as much as i care about him and other similar stuff and said so much selfloathing stuff to him the night ended with me falling asleep in my other friends bed and throwing up all over myself i didnt remember any of it i could have choked in my sleep and even now i cant get myself to care this week both of my friends basically had talks with me which kind of were interventions they said stuff like if it keeps happening like this our friendship is going to be done i feel so out of control i cant even feel anything in regards to what theyre saying to me i just feel numb its almost like the only way i can actually feel is when im drunk or otherwise messed up but i cant tell them that i dont understand how this keeps happening i cant keep track of my own mind the way it works it makes me feel fucking weird and outofbody to look back on my behavior and i find it so difficult to change ive been to therapy once before and i am on the waiting list to see a new therapist the biggest problem i feel like is that i act out because i am afraid of losing my friends and i have massive abandonment issues i never had good friendships and i was in an abusive relationship for almost six years its really hard for me to accept that people can just decide to leave at any moment anyways i act out because of this fear but then the way i act will only repel people from me further it seems like an endless cycle thats so incredibly hard to break by myself i need support but i cant keep placing my emotional issues onto my friends its not their responsibility i just want to be happy and okay i guess i wonder how other people deal with these fears feelings realities anything helps because i keep losing friends over stuff like this it has happened about two or three times before that people have gotten sick of me due to my emotional state and it reignites my suicidal thoughts every single time any advice with having friends and being like this thank you,post-pandemic,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1

im 20 going 21 my gf is 18 going 19 she has depression and anxiety i too have had depression anxiety and been suicidal for most of my teenage years but now im pretty much out of it she is not this year she will graduate and after that she doesnt know if she wants to go to university or do someone else she doesnt know what to do with her future she doesnt see any future and she wants to die before this future ever happens she has been bullied because of her weight since she was a child and now has anxiety because of that and basically doesnt have any friend other than a long distance one she is kind of friend with some of her classmates and today she was planning to go lunch with them but the day before they all said no and after that she basically broke down thats what always happens to her every single time she tries to do something with them in the end they either reject her or say no the day before they just dont fucking care about her after that she broke down and even blocked me because i tried to help her sleep telling her she could listen to some music like i always do she blocked me this isnt the first time she blocked me she always does it in an high stress moment and then after that she unblocks me some time later she did so this time too but this time i didnt try to call her and obsess over her and she seemed upset today i offered to go out and have an ice cream like we always used to do but she said fuck ice cream and she didnt want to see me tonight even tho she invited me at her place then she said i could come and then i told her we could do nothing and just comfort her then i told her i could tell her a thing about me she said she didnt want to hear sad things and she couldnt bear the weight of another person like bitch i already fucking am but you dont give a shit about me huh but she said she was curious so i told her it was just about me knowing exactly how it feels to have an eco chamber of negativity in her head and thats why i stick to wanting to help her she then said she didnt want to hear this thing that everyone always says it and that now i bother her and she doesnt want to see me again i always tried to support her but it all is useless she goes to a psychologist but she never talks about her serious problems and when i tell her to do so she gets mad im sick and tired of this happening over and over again now she is texting me about how i only want to help her just because i want to show her im a good person and that i treat her like a poor person and that i pity her but its not the fucking truth i want to help her because she really is a nice person that is suffering a lot and doesnt know how to live i want to build something with her im not with her just out of pity or shit like that but because i really want to be with her but its getting harder and harder everytime i too have had gone trough some shit and felt like i couldnt get out of it i felt pointless and that my existence was meaningless i had no purpose in life just like how she feels now i just wanted to help her and tell her it will all go well but she keeps on making things worse for herself and sabotages herself i really dont want to leave her thats not what love and relationships are about but i dont want to down another hell like i did with other people so what should i do,post-pandemic,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0

so my therapist that ive only seen two times thinks im not a good candidate for therapy she thinks that im too depressed for it despite being on heavy medications that im going to see a doctor about and reevaluate in a few weeks she didnt think that a combination of psychotherapy and medications combined would work for me instead she suggested ect treatment after only talking for 80 minutes total after doing extensive research this is only offered after you have tried a combination of both therapy and meds and have psychotic symptoms and have a high risk for suicide all of which i dont have i am severely depressed but my life is incredibly stable for the first time in my life i know how to handle my depression and my anxiety and do so very well which she agreed on mind you but she still thinks im too depressed and shes afraid therapy might make it worse ive done cbt before only for my anxiety so i am well aware it might get much worse before it gets better yet the cbt was very successful and no matter how hard it got and how badly i wanted to quit i still showed up for every single appointment and did every homework i got i am not a quitter nor will i ever be all i want is some help to get better without frying my brain is that too much to ask for am i unreasonable for thinking that psychotherapy and trauma therapy might be a good place to start just needed to rant and vent a little so if anyone actually read this far thank you,post-pandemic,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

for normal people with healthy brains honestly do those even exist anymore whenever things in their life are going wrong they do what they can to fix it and get better for those of us who are depressed and do not have that luxury weve lost interest in caring for ourselves theres no clear path on how to fix our lives and the chances of actually succeeding are minimal at best the amount of effort required is too great and we find life and especially our own lives to be meaningless so why bother trying ive grown more apathetic towards life and i really can be bothered to care much about myself i see my mental state getting worse and life passing me by bit really i just dont care i find myself unable to relate to others when they talk about their futures because i genuinely dont see one for myself and im not interested in trying to build one especially when i have no building materials and no way of obtaining them this has to be the worst part about being depressed its an illness that makes you not care enough to get help and better yourself leading to a slow decline with endless sadness and misery while your physical health worsens if that isnt the scariest illness then i dont know what else is,post-pandemic,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,1

hi rdepression my 39f spouse has battled depression for most of her life and it has slowly gotten worse over time shes been in weekly therapy her entire life and has been seeing a therapist that she likes and trusts weekly or sometimes twiceweekly for the past 4 years she went a long time unmedicated and only a few years ago went on a popular ssri for the first time that was prescribed by her pcm its worked pretty well to stabilize her and give her that buffer to make the lows less low but over time shes still getting worse what she wants and i agree is to see a psychiatrist to get onto an actual medically endorsed path to improve her situation and control her ssri while were grateful we got her on an ssri and it has made a difference i think its kind of crazy that we can mess with her brain chemistry by just getting a script from someone completely unqualified and without an actual medical program or systematic profile to give her an onramp to improvement here just take these pills youll feel better is kind of how it seems to be treated heres the issue our pcm retired and its not a 6mo wait to see a new pcm just for an introductory meeting we need the intro meeting in order to get a referral to a psychiatrist what are our options to shortcircuit this process a little bit should we just offer to pay cash out of pocket just to get an initial consult with a psychiatrist i feel like her situation has gotten a lot worse recently and dont want to wait another 6mo just to see a pcm just to get a referral to go onto another waitlist for a psychiatrist for 612mo from nowit could literally be years before she sees someone granted part of this is our fault we should have tried to get the referral in while we still had a pcm for her previously looking for advice on getting her to a psychiatrist as quickly as possible tia,post-pandemic,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

note i come from a thirdworld country and english is not my first language despite how well i write it please keep in mind not to suggest things that might not be available in countries such as mine the thing with my 17m porn addiction is that it directly takes root from my sexual trauma due to csa that happened to me twice at the of eight by different people the first abuser did stuff to me over a course of two months where they used to feminise me and use my body and the other one was done by an uncle who gave me fellatio and forced me into it too one of my abusers introduced me to porn when i was 8 and it stuck to me everything about my sexuality and my identity was destroyed due to my csa it left me damaged as an individual and i experienced gender and body dysmorphia due to one of my abuser feminising my body calling my chubby body out and sexualising its meatiness for femininity and softness due to being choked and getting my penis touched getting my chest stimulated and getting my ass grabbed i developed a weird sensitivity around these areas and even the slightest of contact still turns me on im extremely horny all the time and really hypersexual i know this is probably tmi i dont even know why im making this post but i need to share this somewhere i started masturbating at a really young age and my fantasies kept worsening after that ive been a porn addict since i was about 10 this addiction made me severely mentally unstable as a child expecting sex to be very gratifying and i masturbated a lot by the age of 12 i was already watching the most taboo porn categories to exist because the craze for the next worst thing was maddeningly hot to me i used to introduce my cousins and friends and neighbours to porn and i even used to form groups as we all watched it my younger years had me so rotten due to this addiction that it was my form of pass time as opposed to youtube or sports or video games this obviously led to me being a degenerate and i severely struggled to talk to girls or boys for that matter i sexualised genatalia in my head and though i think im pansexual im not too sure as im only attracted to women but something about penises as being part of my only sexual experience has left me somewhat confused about whether im truly pansexual or just have a sexualised view of genitals i eventually got into worse and worse stuff listening for hours to no end to hypnotic videos telling me im not a man sissy hypno and i kid you not that shit works my sexual trauma mightve aided in it working but i started to sexualise gender transformation too and crossdressing theres still nothing that turns me off ive went on dark web and forums searching for worse and worse media and its not good for me i stopped after realising most of it was illegal but its definitely scarred me i dream about my abusers a lot when im asleep and it leaves me distraught theyre a distant memory now of events that happened almost a decade ago but it still haunts me to this day and sometimes turns me on i imagine getting raped tortured and all of the worst stuff fills my brain and its a turn on for me yet this level of masochism is still never enough for me no matter what i know its a result of my trauma and though i can soundly say my thoughts are not me but my trauma speaking i still find myself thinking ill never get better about being ugly about not having someone wholl love me ever still being a virgin and having never touched a girl not even held hands with one despite how much i am attracted to them doesnt help either its almost as though i convince myself at times that no one will ever like me my hypersexuality often makes me irrevocably horny when i was 14 i remember being alone at home one day not sleeping and masturbating a whole of fourteen times in 24 hours i suck at building relationships drive people away and betray their trusts sometimes get too in my head and act compulsively damaging everything and everyones perceptions of me that ive faked for them on the surface i am smart i have a high iq too 135 and ive got a creative brain ive got passions ive got things to look forward to but deep down i have no love in my life my brains always distracted i suspect having adhd but selfdiagnosis is no good despite the courses i took on psychology to understand myself better i always searched for love in friends family lovers but friends always left father was abusive mother was mostly an enabler and lovers were people i met online thousands of miles away my first online girlfriend ghosted me the second one cheated on me that shattered me too i want to pursue medicine but im not good at chemistry haha our high school teacher sucked at teaching chemistry because my school was cheap as shit that couldnt accomodate good teachers third world go figure so teachers without qualifications taught us most of the subjects and chemistry is something ill have to be good at if i want to pursue medicine so im not going to try med school and as i said i probably have adhd so anything that doesnt interest me usually fails to even be something i feel like studying i just end up procrastinating for days i was always more into psychiatry and psychology though so i have been considering bs in psychology for college and to then go on for masters abroad hopefully if that plan succeeds i seriously doubt it will i might become a psychologist one day to help people like myself pipe dreams eh my father ks against that too they believe psychology is a stupid field and ill be wasting my life going that route getting into med school is tough in my country if you want it to be affordable and were not rich at all so he wants me to do something he chooses for me ive directed a documentary before and even filmmaking was something i considered pursuing but my parents shat all over that too my dad is a control freak and extremely abusive to this day and my mom just enables him by not defending me until she believes that hes hit me enough he usually gets especially abusive when it comes to my choices not being to his liking this can be as little of a choice as a hairstyle or as big as my career he micromanages and controls everything ive been beaten since i was three and now im almost eighteen hes beaten me to the point of me throwing up concussions bruises and even more i havent let him do the same to my younger brother so im kind of proud that i could be the disabler of his abuse for my brother ive seen him abuse alcohol and smoke ciggerates enough as a child to be repulsed by it so luckily i never fucked myself up with that shit im also chronically ill over everything else nothing serious just chronic migraines chronic bronchitis and they have significantly limited my lifes normal functioning though i also have a dislocated wrist that my father never got treated because he thought i was overexaggerating it now its a hindrance in my daily activities and i cant even write for long periods so now im left here with cptsd a crippling porn addiction chronic illnesses suicidal ideation lack of direction in life lack of love and support and friends inability to concentrate probably adhd and it just feels like all is lost i know this isnt my fault for those who are about to preach that i know my trauma makes me speak lots of stuff about myself thats not entirely true ive studied psychology so i know about all that trust me i just wish life couldve been easier i contemplate suicide a lot i cant commit to it because im scared of death and pain but i have my reasons now to give up these reasons being that my only hope of being happy doing something i love will also not come true because of my dad if that does happen ill kill myself thats a final one i dont think theres much to advice here please dont suggest therapy because i cant get therapy because 1 its unaffordable 2 my parents wont get me therapy tldr mental health has worsened due to trauma and other

i feel like my depression takes away my brains ability to simply ignore all the countless problems in the world the poverty hunger abuse war corruption all of which could be significantly reduced if humanity wasnt so selfish hurtful weak and idiotic the pointless grind of working terrible jobs just to survive the futility of going after your dreams because none of them are likely to become a reality the inevitability of pain and death for you and everyone around you where the best case scenario is that you die quickly and are the first one to do so life is just a nonstop horror show depression doesnt make it seem like it life actually is terrible depression just makes it impossible to ignore,post-pandemic,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,1

can anyone relate imo theres a big difference between wanting to die and not wanting to exist i dont want to die because despite the loneliness i feel there are still people out there who love me even if it doesnt feel that way and i love them for that matter plus id never have the guts to take my own life what i really want is for the pain to stop and every night it does for a few hours when im asleep unconsciousness is bliss to someone like me who finds the waking world miserable its a lack of existence especially since i dont dream or at least dont remember them just because i dont want to exist doesnt mean i want to die though it means that i dont want to exist the way im existing right now with this pain all i want to do is escape my existence and escape the pain i want to feel better this is why i look forward to bedtime every night and have the most difficult time waking up in the morning if i didnt have a job id probably sleep all day just so i wouldnt have to be out in the world and be depressed simply put if the pain actually stopped maybe id be happy or at least okay with existing but right now im not if only there was a way to not exist for longer than 8 hours at a time,post-pandemic,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1
to begin with i am a 6ft hispanic tan skinned skinny male living in the states my whole life ive always had attraction from women but i always was too deathly afraid and timid to talk to any women i have talked to women before but if its a woman whose interested in me i become a mess i know my traits mean nothing unless i actually utilize them but ive had different types of women shown me interest my parents never cared about me and my mom would always harass me because i never got my girlfriend and even today when i asked her why her and my dad never taught me to talk to girls she said not my problem to make matters worse ive been dealing with a pornmasturbation addiction since i was 8 im 26 now soon to be 27 my porn addiction started out relatively tame then as time went on it spiraled out of control and lately i have been watching some very unhingeddangerous type of porn throughout highschool i had no girl show me interest apart from one which i really fumbled the bag with it it took me years for me to stop thinking about her started my second job after leaving highschool and things just went crazy a year after starting my job i had this one girl who was absolutely crazy about me and was the most beautiful woman i have ever met and throughout my time working there i was having a different girl show me romantic interest every few months i hope i dont sound like im exaggerating or bragging or whatever but i really did well fast forward to now and that beautiful woman i met who continued to show me interest the past 6 years i cut contact with her a few months ago i never was confident in myself and still am i was always picked on at school and my mom would yell at me whenever i told her i was being bullied instead of doing something life went on and all the girls who were interested in me flirting with me showing me signs moved on and left it wasnt until 2020 when we got this new girl in my store a very short tanskinned hispanic short hair tomboy at first our relationship was very strained as she was very nasty with me then later on her behavior with me changed i thought she was the cutest girl ever my coworker very much noticed how much she liked me she tried every trick to get my attention but i was too scared eventually i noticed her disappointment and felt bad about it then shortly after she left and when i realized she was gone i fell into a heavy depression as she was a one of a kind girl and i was never going to get an opportunity to meet someone like her again i had trouble sleeping each night and eventually the only way i found to sleep was to imagine scenarios with random women i have been doing this for about two years now well last year in the beginning of the year my neighbors youngest kidi live in a duplex house moved back in and brought his girlfriend with him and ended up being the absolute worse year of my life she would ramp up the volume of the tv almost every night i begged my parents to do something about it but my mom would get frustrated at me it went on with the kid and girl being total fucking assholes whenever they could intentionally ramping up the noise when i come home or my parents come home from work making noise until 2 or 3 in the morning other bunch of nonsense the noise however did stop around late december but because of all the noise i have anxiety and lately i have been hearing random high pitched noises from them and its been messing with me i hate everything about my life and wished i could just live a boring life in a boring body im sorry for this massive amount of text but for anyone who reads this thank you very much,post-pandemic,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1

exercisephysical activity eating healthy spending time in nature finding a hobby are all things that are supposed to be good for your mental health but by definition depression is a problem precisely because it inhibits your inability to function much less do things that are good for you finding a therapist trialling multiple therapists to see which one suits me best or even starting on antidepressants and having to check in with a doctorpsychiatrist every few weeks or having to change medications because one might fuck up my head even more or not even work all takes so much fucking effort that i cant bother to do any of it i went to a counsellor at my university earlier this year and they suggested things like group therapy for my anxiety and volunteering for causes because that can give people a sense of purpose in day to day life and i just didnt know how to tell them that is exactly the problem i have utterly no will to do any of that and thats why im sitting in your office right now and i dont know what anyone can possibly do about me being this way if people with depression were able to so easily do things to help themselves we wouldnt need to classify it as an illness or disorder thats why its so infuriating when we see how even professional mental health advocacy organizations repeat the hackneyed slogans which i cannot understand how they are even still in mass circulation its so irrational and frustrating that im physically able to take ten steps out of the house to just go on a goddamn walk but i have absolutely no mental will to do anything but lie in bed only listening to music is the only action that can be done purely passively with no effort whatsoever but then i just get sad and start spiralling from guilt and i cant stop thinking about how irrational it is even though ive experienced it for so many years im constantly surprising myself from my own incompetence as if i ever expected anything different more than hopelessness i just feel confused as to what im supposed to do when i cant will myself to do anything what even is this anymore edit thank you for all the comments i didnt expect to get any response its hard to describe but i feel very moved that there are people out there that i reached in a small way for a short moment of time,post-pandemic,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0

get better youre a beautiful strong woman and everything will turn out wonderfully if you just have patiencei can say that with less than six months until i turn 40 i feel no less depressed than the day i was hospitalized at age 12 for trying to kill myself via starvation i can say honestly that at that point i had absolutely no trauma in my life my parents did nothing but love and care for me i just so happen to have a depressed brainand the beginning of puberty allowed its awakening i was able to make it through high school because i went to a charter school specifically for kids with emotional disturbances but i only made it halfway through college before i had another fullfledged episode of depression and had to drop out i was walking out of classes because i needed to cry for no reason i still lived at home and about a year later my parents told me i need to work the only job i could do one that allowed me to come and go as i please and take time off when i needed it and still be able to support myself was stripping in the meantime i was violently raped by a friend of mine i couldntt deal with it so i just went to work the next day like nothing happened with a tampon up my ass so i wouldnt bleed everywhere supressed it as long as i could until again i woke up and decided i wanted to die began therapy a few years laterlast i saw he was happily married with children my fucking rapist got the life i wanted and never had while i was able to move out on my own thanks to dancing after 7 years i was vomiting before shifts and my boyfriend at the time had told me that he would never marry me as long as i was dancing so i decided i was mentally well enough to try school again and graduated one year later with my certification in personal training i spent a few years making minimum wage to build my experience and finally i got a fulltime gig with benefits all the while noticing that my boyfriend still didnt seem into marrying me it had been 6 yearshe finally told me we are not financially stable yet even tho he made over 100000 a yearbut alright turns out he was cheating on me with a goddamn stripclub bartender i googled his email because i had forgotten his amazon name and ended up finding a whole bunch of shit that devastated me his reaction was to first say i didnt think youd ever find that well use a different handle than the one you always use next time then to tell me that i needed to move out told him i didnt have the money to move out he said he would pay for the deposit but when i found a placehe couldnt produce it finally told me he didnt want me to leave after all we can work on this blah until six months later when he finally admittedafter 8 yearsthat he didnt want to marry me ever i just wasnt a good enough homemaker i finally asked for help from my one rich aunt got the deposit finally moved out while in the meantime i had been promoted to head pt and trainer for new staff despite the heartbreak at home i actually had a job with a prestigous title for me and an actual successful career i was making enough to pay rent and was on track for another raise until 2 weeks later when i was fired over the phone because one front desk worker said she heard me jerking off a client on an recumbent bike seriously never in one million years would i have ever even thought of doing such a thing but you knowshe was 18 and her boyfriend enjoyed his workouts with me that was enough for her to make sure i never worked there againi was never accused once of jerking someone off when i was a goddam stripper of course with no job and no income i was given one months notice to move out i found a cheap room and was able to get some work at an old colleagues new gym i didnt have a lot of hope for the future but i still had a little and then i got covid and almost died from it its been six months and im still too weak to walk let alone train too much brain fog to really do any sort of work and only have two weeks of unemployment that i had to fight for left i have no money and no job no man has ever decided i was worthy enough of marriage or having a family with my own body has become a shell of itself and the hypoxia from covid as well as the inflammation in my brain from it has made my depression 1000x worse i tell people i need help physically and mentally but all i have to do is say trump could have handled this betterand they basically tell me i should kill myself because saying mean things about trump hurts their feelings or theyre just so tired of the minimal restrictions that they freely admit they just dont care about me or my health anymore because you know people need indoor dining but they dont need me these are people who claim to love me saying these things this is my support system saying these things to me can anyone here honestly say if they were me they would still have hope that things will get better im not doing another 40 years of this and since covid didnt kill me though it came so close i

hi everyone using a throwaway to avoid identification as i 19f write this im on the verge of tears and have a lump in my throat for no discernible reason before this i spent the whole day lying in the same spot watching tv save for the one time i got up to make myself instant noodles at dinner i started tearing up because i was disappointed with the food this is kinda embarrassing my mum keeps asking me why im always lying down not in a malicious way or anything and i cant really pinpoint the reason but im always unexplainably exhausted the good days are fine and sometimes really good but the bad days like today just really suck i feel like i am suspended in time and everything is in slow motion i have wasted yet another day for some context im in a transitional period in my life graduated from high school waiting to start college in october ive had some moments of euphoria here and there that made me feel at the top of the world got accepted to some really good schools etc however for the most part nothing really excites me this is a real low compared to my last 2 years of high school consistent high achiever top student for a bunch of subjects you get the gist during which i felt some degree of fulfilment because i kept getting told i was good at things i notice that when im not occupied by the hustle and bustle of school i always get like this more intensely than otherwise like during summer vacations another thing every single friend of mine has been motivated enough to get a job and do stuff that excites them ive barely done anything the only 2 things i managed to bring myself to do in the last 3 months were the result of me being talked into them by various people i am a major pushover so obviously i ended up doing them i just cannot bring myself to apply for a part time job because everyday i just go i am tired and ill do it another day i feel like shit because i dont know if i have a problem or if my problem is just that im lazy my head is really heavy as i write this so i apologize for my streamofconsciousness writing style the reason why im so confused is that when i am in social settings im really lively and fun im also a very typical gifted kid overachiever with much less to worry about that my friends who are on the edges of their seats trying to figure out what to do in the future and shit i have a loving family and supportive friends i am grateful for everything i have but i just get extremely blue and temperamental for no reason sometimes i dont dare to discuss this with anyone i know because nobody would expect this from me i dont know if this information helps but i typically feel like this during long holidays basically if people arent giving me responsibilities i cant bring myself to do anything im so sorry i dont have the ability to organise this coherently right now but could anyone share what depression can feel like or at least give me a reality check if i really am just lazy and melodramatic some clarity would be amazing please be as candid as possible because if it really just is an attitude problem at least i can stop being selfpitying and start doing something about it just a disclaimer i have never seriously considered suicide but from time to time i wonder what it would be like to just disappear dont worry about me being a danger to myself because i would never do it that was a really long post if you read to the end thank you edit ill be deleting this account soon but before that thank you everyone for the kind words advice and suggestions it means the world to me and im going to try to act on your advice 3 take care of yourselves,post-pandemic,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1

hi all i am new here so i am sorry if i violate any posting rules i wanted to ask the question in the title essentially and see if any others find themselves facing depressive episodes triggered by seeing people you care about depressedtriggeredanxious i first started dealing with depression in high school after dealing with a very serious life event and didnt know what it was at the time to seek treatmenttherapy fast forward 15 years and i still experience brief bouts of depression that can last 13 days recently however i have noticed that most of these episodes seem to be occur after people in my life that matter to me share their own troubles with mental health or difficulty in life i do my best to listen and be of help but afterward and even during these conversations i find myself monstrously depressed and borderline nonverbal i dont want to be a bad friendpartnerrelative but i am having a lot of difficulty shouldering other peoples problems i find myself yearning for simplicity and neatness and no longer desire to know the messy workings of other peoples lives but how do you say that without sounding like an asshole i feel doubly guilty trying to wash my hands of these matters because i genuinely come from a pretty privileged upbringing my parents were always uppermiddle class and though their marriage was a disaster they gave me an amazing childhood many people dont have that sort of background and so i feel its unfair for me to turn my back on them i am seeking any general advice or experience people might have here thanks so much,post-pandemic,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

the first advice you see on googling depression is do things you used to enjoy right well ive gotten really good at making myself do things i make myself do my job i make myself do a side hustle i make myself read books and post about them on my blog this month im making myself do nanowrimo i presume the idea is that at some point you start enjoying things again but i havent ever managed to get to that stage i dread my side hustle i never know what to say about books until i start writing i write exactly the number of words i need to hit my goal and then i stop i dont enjoy any of it some of it i really hate and ive been doing the side hustle for a year and five months and the blog for two years so its not a matter of it give it time x200b i dont know how to make myself do things if i dont treat them as obligations anything optional i just dont do it feels like a vicious cycle where the only way to make myself do something also makes me hate it is there a way around this has anyone else felt this i cant seem to find anything online that even mentions this being a problem let alone actually proposing a solution x200b im trying to make myself go for a walk every day because thats supposed to be good for your mood and it feels like an actual punishment,post-pandemic,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0

venting out i 28f come from a nuclear family and my dad had been on work trips for most parts so i was raised majorly by my mom and i have no siblings my dad was one of the best people on earth and i lost him a few months ago my mom on the other hand is a good person but she was extremely verbally abusive towards everyone in the family and physically abusive to us and her parents so i always hated her growing up i saw my dad getting abused by her my whole life and never knew what i could do to help him so i ended up crying all the time but both of them loved me to death we have moved a lot geographically so i was never able to have stable group of friends finally i went to an all girls college and everyone hated me there as i was this extremely spoiled daddys princess who knew nothing in real world and i used to cry in my room all the time so my life was still pretty fucked up the only escape i ever had was jumping from one relationship to another i have been doing that since i was 14 so i continued doing that i threw all my anger at my boyfriends and then would change my relationship when things would get bad anyhow my college got over and i got a job and have been working since this is the only good thing i have i am financially independent i got into this relationship over 2 years ago and things were wonderful in the beginning except i messed things up by throwing my anger at him but he never left me and i thought hey now that all my anger is gone i can finally begin to be a healthy relationship but god had other plans he has started to take revenge and he insults me hurts me blames every chance he gets and i have lost every ounce of self respect i ever had he is a good guy and had made significant sacrifices to be with me does not have bad habits nothing questionable so i feel that if i let him go i wouldnt ever get a good guy so i digest all the hatred with a pinch of salt i do this because i think its my karma coming back and this is what i deserve i have lost my dad a few months ago then i had a surgery which has an extremely long recovery and one of my closest friends got married and rest of them are all married engaged pregnantmaking alot of money i am living with my family due to recovery and they love me but i think they dont like me as a person and that is true for everyone else in my life too i do not have friends to reach out to therapy is too expensive my boyfriend hates me cant share all this with my family as my mom is also processing grief overall i am completely alone and super lonely another thing to know about me is i am an extremely logical person thrive for perfection in every aspect of my life and generally dont give importance to emotions and now i am overwhelmed to point where i dont know what to do i know for a fact that this relationship is doomed to fail and i am not cut out to be a wifemother i lack empathy and emotional understanding plus i have too much baggage i had hobbies when i was a child but since we moved so much geographically i got out of touch and now i have no hobby my mom also made sure to feed me for my entire life that my friends are bad my relatives are bad everyone is out there to hurt me so as an adult i never know how to sustain any friendship and i also have no contact with my relatives because i wasnt allowed to for about 25 years i am a complete loner and all i want is to stay on my bed and use my phone which is really depressing but thats what i like however i do make a effort to do a few things during the day as a result of all of the above i feel like i am going to die alone,post-pandemic,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0

im currently living in japan since a couple years from now im also carrying a peculiar kind of depression its not like the depression started since i came here actually coming was kind of liberating in some ways ive had since 10 years old or so a healthwise poor environment in my home where i lived in a apartment with my mother and two dogs this may sound ridiculous but despite being a loving and caring mother she has a serious dependency on dogs and a kind of mix of hypochondriac depression bad stress management and apathy towards how to raise 2 dogs without exposing to her so called loved son to a house full of crap in the most literal sense possible this environment not only attempted to our health wealth being dogs included and else things of similar category that ill leave to the readers commonsensewise imagination but also diminished a great deal of my feeling of accomplishment you may think why or more likely you dont and my embarrassment makes me wish to distrust this belief and its clouding my imagination ill explain its grounds anyways maybe it even will be a good reference to someone in a analogous situation when you live in a filthy place when a depressed person which demonstrates affection but lacks demonstration with certain commitments and choices one or at least me particularly may start feeling a responsability towards that environment but being convinced that the dogs are a necessity and an end in itself kind of a moral duty i felt like it was my responsibility to think throught the situation and fix it but i failed and i was actively manipulated to maintain the situation like being convinced of adopting a third female dog with the argument that it may end the bloody fights of the big two dogs surprise it only got way worse but i was eleven but it we didnt adopt it the dog may be killed saying to an eleven years old after he cries in refusal of more dogs that the tiny baby dog will likely be killed but also dont worry im calling them now to tell them not to bring it this is dirty dont you think or putting a cell dividing the leaving room so that the male dogs wont be in contact and kill themselves or making me active in the decision of ending that situation same eleven having to stop my crying mother to take one of the dogs back we didnt even throw it away he is doing just god damn fine 11 years later with a familys friends family i know this sounds almost like a monthy pythons sketch and you may be surprise to know my mother is actually an intelligent person and good advicer and friend and a caring mother within her posibilities but this experience which i surely must to let go from one and for all for some reason got away my feeling of fullfilment when being independent alongside my respect towards my parents modus vivendi like i abandoned a 55 years old child in my hometown and no matter what kind of achievement i make in my life i have this impulse that tells me you are abandoning and i can not remember with what moral compass i was raised anymore i have the guess that because my mother does not understand the severity of that situation i started allowing myself to feel a victim beyond that boundary and feeling authority do not understand me so i respond to none kind of heart i feel resentful to none but my selfworth and sense of community is heavily damaged i feel ashamed at every time and i do not know the path to healing resume of what i said in adlerian terms paternal figure showed to be non trust worthy so my opinion of life became of non trust because i cannot trust myself i cannot trust that my achievements have value per se and im god damn afraid about it,post-pandemic,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

hey i took my first sertraline pill yesterday and although a lot of people have told me i wont feel any benefit for a while im certainly feeling something or nothing i dont feel as heavy and im certainly not thinking about suicide and self harm anymore it just makes me feel sort of numb does anyone else who takes meds get this it also gives me a horrible headache and other gross side effects which is something i feared but im surprisingly okay with it i have anxiety and adhd as well as depression and to be honest its just super weird feeling different does that make sense im not used to feeling chronically suicidal i dont feel the need to sleep off my thoughts i can sort of divide what disorder is flaring up by the symptoms im experiencing but maybe thats just chronic overthinking i dont really trust the prescription i was given i dont even have a formal diagnosis i dont think although all my episodes and behaviours are on my doctors notes the mh nurse ive been seeing says they avoid diagnosing and just try to treat it based on the symptoms which i guess makes sense i was crying my eyes out and i felt really terribly suicidal last night and thats why i took the pill i was too scared to take them until then i was actually considering trying to od with them instead of using them to help myself but that was when i was really really low sorry this is probably really incoherent i hope this doesnt go against any rules its not my intention im wondering if anyone else has experienced this or if anyone can relate at all thanks for reading if you got this far aha sorry again edit my partners brother is on different meds but he was shocked when i said im on 50mg cause hes only on 20mg i forgot to mention that when i was talking about the prescription is 50mg a lot hmm,post-pandemic,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

i feel like i have no urgency to have a life work sounds like a horrendous repetitive cycle i look at myself in the mirror and cant recognize myself i dont know who i am and i dont know if i ever will a person i love greatly recently implied some things behind my back that really impacted me personally after i had told them some shitty things that had happen to me very recently i have felt like people could care less about my issues as if they havent been continuous and life altering my grandma recently killed herself when i had just lost my other grandma a few months back my mom relapsed alcoholic after being sober for 6 months and brought her terrible excuse of a boyfriend over from another state after he was the reason she relapsed in her past and to add to everything i had someone i loved drove everywhere bought things for and supported emotionally begin to talk about my flaws and insecurities after i had told her everything being fully aware that i despised my attributes and appearance deeply adding fire to the flame but also not telling me to my face and rather to my other friends i dont feel like i have a support system that is reliable i have begged for a form of therapy and medication but havent had any luck future is looking bleak i dont know whats next and i dont know if i want to the only thing keeping me going is my few friends that as far as i know havent been backstabbing and my little siblings i worry they wont be enough soon it sounds selfish but the overwhelming urgency to die has been so overwhelming in the past months i havent felt much else ive been trying so hard to push it away but it claws at me always beckoning me to go through with it i get so sick of finally healing and everything crashing down as if the universe is testing me and seeing how much it can push me down before i take matters into my own hands in most terms i am a failure and i dont say it out loud but i can be a piece of shit i feel like a failure to society but also within a family role im failing classes dont have the will to do them even for the sake of my future doesnt feel like my future exists everyone had such high expectations for who i was gonna be being a smart kid but now im here no motivation no consistent passions or desires and a looming feeling of dread for my life,post-pandemic,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,1

as a part of my mental illness i suffer from strong self doubts and feelings of being worthless and i often got told that if i have these i need to think very positively about myself and realise that these thoughts arent true but it never worked my negativity is way too strong to be able to habe any positive thoughts about myself let alone to have stronger positive than negative thoughts so my current therapist suggested another approach she said instead of forcing myself to think positive i should try to not evaluate myself at all for a certrain time neither negatively nor positively though the second is rather rare anyway what this does is that it gives some distance to the negative thoughts and therefore breaks that cycle of depression where depression makes me have negative thoughts and the negative thoughts make me depressed this is way easier because i just have to be neutral instead of positive and i notice what she means with breaking the cycle i hope that this might help someone here edit i dont know what to say right now last time i looked at my phone this had 10 upvoted and i was so happy that 10 people considered this useful and now i see this thank you so much this means the world to me,post-pandemic,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

i 28f have been on escitalopram 20mg for almost 3 years to help with my depression and anxiety it has worked really well so well that i got lax with it because im an idiot the first time was last year it ended with me having a breakdown and telling my partner 28m that i hadnt been on top of taking it everyday we fought and we made up i started taking it again and got better then the past month i got lax with it again i dont have a good reason for doing this i cant make excuses i just dont always take it and a little voice in the back of my head says maybe i dont need it anymore i know this is wrong and you shouldnt do it but i just did not trying to make an excuse just for context im pretty rubbish at looking after myself i think its from being depressed for so many years before getting medicated i vape quit cigarettes used to do a lot of drugs eating is a chore exercise for the sake of exercise isnt in my vocabulary and i work myself sick i dont know if this comes into it when it comes to taking my meds i dont go to therapy as ive tried so many and they havent been good for me and its so expensive anyway last night i felt like shit and my partner asked what was wrong and i was honest about how i was feeling and one thing i told him was how i felt like no one cares about me and i dont have someone to provide support obviously not something your amazing partner wants to hear he got upset and basically said i was wrong to feel that way and went to sleep on the couch i knew i was feeling like that because i hadnt been taking my meds as prescribed and i didnt want to take one last night because it messes with my sleep so i waited until my usual morning time when i took it this morning my partner asked if i had been taking them and i was honest and said that it had been intermittent he got incredibly angry and upset with me i completely understand his reaction as i didnt tell him about it i dont know why i didnt maybe because of what happened the first time or i felt like it would dismiss my own feelings and ive always said i dont want my depression to cause a rift between us because my mother took hers out on me but i went ahead and did something selfish like this and made him feel awful because of it he says ive broken his trust and he doesnt believe me when i say i wont do it again i cant say i blame him but i really truly dont want to lose the relationship weve put so much into over the past 7 years and i know after this event that i wouldnt do it again he means the world to me and i am the idiot who jeopardised that just because i couldnt stay on top of my meds and help myself to help our relationship this is the worst thing either of us have ever done we are faithful and always honest with each other but for some reason i wasnt honest with this and let it get to a point where i made everything shit we own a home together and moved states together and i worry that he will be stuck with me because of this and that i cant actually do anything to restore how he feels about me im not sure what i want to get out of this post i know i messed up i know i hurt him and its my fault maybe if there are others who have struggled with staying on top of their meds or if there are others who have had relationship problems because of something similar could share their experience maybe advice on what i can do to try and rebuild that trust maybe some honest berating to really drive home what a shit person i am for doing this to him i really want to repent i just dont know how and if i even deserve forgiveness for this maybe its too far gone this time but im desperate to restore it maybe thats selfish of me thank you for reading all of this,post-pandemic,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0

so over the next few weeks a situation may or may not occur where ill have the opportunity to end my life chances are 5050 ive been an addict for a long time and have wanted out of this existence for much longer i havent been in active addiction but had a small relapse recently so far using drugs has been the only thing keeping me alive but now its starting to come to a close and losing its enjoyment because of all the bs addiction comes with my mind and life just seem unrecoverable and i really am a useless addition to this world maybe things could be straightened out and in 5 years or something ill be fully recovered and able to contribute something positive but the chances of that are very low and my mind is a shitstorm sober i cant take care of myself or make any strides forwards because a depressive episode always swoops in and leaves me debilitated idk who designed reality to be like this god are you real but quite frankly its a nightmare to behold not even sad about dying tbh everyone does one day and keeping someone around if they are suffering this much is selfish in its own way im truly a piece of shit and bring everyone downam detrimental to the flourishing of friends and family or at least thats what my childhood and former years have burned into my brain ive been taken advantage of sexually abused emotionally gaslightedfucked with by my parents am socially abnormal have no skills or talents not a very high iq and have always been let down when believing there is love and acceptance in the world its a dark place filled with evil sometimes you get a taste of the light but then its ripped away because behind the mask is a demon laughing at you for being so naive the world feels like purgatory my demons have me on a leash and people seem to toy with me too how anyone finds putting themselves above others to be fun ill never understand so yeah thats the jist of things and personally im kind of hoping to be released from this nightmare before it gets worse i dont want to have a family because it will probably damage whoever is in it and im not smart enough to make a real difference in the world really nothing will be missing if there was the potential that i could help benefit the world maybe id side with staying here but thats really not the case maybe in the next plane of existence ill be less detrimental,post-pandemic,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1

i actually felt suicidal today really and truly i havent told anyone i know and dont think i will ive found that being vulnerable with some of the people who im supposed to be closest with only gives them more ammunition to hurt me and the ones i do trust well i dont want to feel like a burden on them but it helped so much honestly maybe its kind of fake cuz its their job and theyre trained to be empathetic and understanding but it felt so good to have someone to listen and care to give a fucking shit that i am dying inside and so goddamn overwhelmed with almost all the aspects of my life i cried so so much i hid in the closet of my bedroom for some privacy and just poured my all my pain and worries out to the kind lady on the phone she comforted me and showed me kindness and concern and that felt so fucking good to just have someone listen she said shell call in again to check in on me and that feels nice please use the suicide prevention hotline i was teetering on the edge probably wasnt going to go through with it but i really genuinely wanted to be dead because life had just dealt me one too many blows and i couldnt stand up anymore thank you stranger now im gonna go binge movies and work,post-pandemic,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

i want to share my story with people that dont know me maybe something can make me feel better my story starts at september 2022 when i moved from uk to barcelona i had an easy job not great money but not bad either lots of parties lot of sex lots of friends the difficulty was the fact that i had to change homes and rooms all the time because in barcelona it is very difficult to find a decent home or at least it was difficult for me at some point i had a parasite in my stomach that due to the fact that the hospital lost the results of my exams it took me 1 month to recover i was in real pain and fear for what i may have which at the end was nothing but a simple parasite at my last homeafter 5 changes during may i stayed with someone that was a racist piece of shit and one day completely unprovoked he started hitting me i had to go to the hospital and then to the police to report the incident thats where i decided that i could not longer do that to myself and i should go back to the uk firstly i went back to greece where i am coming from and shortly after i went to a friend of mine in the uk to start looking for a job there there i realised that i had scabies and i went to the doctors i was deep in panic though and i decided that i need to go back to my country to deal with it plus i couldnt not bare the lifestyle of the the uk any more many cremes and remedies solved my issue although i still fight till this day with marks and hyperpigmentation on my skin that make me feel extremely self conscious 2 weeks later i got notified that i had a court trial back to barcelona because that bastard that hit me went to the police and lied that i hit him instead i traveled back for the trial that nothing really happened but it was too stressful for me to have a trial in a foreigner country that i can not even speak the language back to greece all alone and depressed i was praying to god to help me find another job in barcelona to go back to my friends that i had and one special friend like a boyfriend who was waiting for me at the middle of october i found a good job in sales and went to the house of this boyfriend i was extremely happy for this opportunity to have my life back but from the moment i arrived i was acting very badly and very stressed the house of this boyfriend was very untidy and somehow dirty so in my stress attacks i was starting to accusing him that i got the scabies from his house the first time he let me stay to his place after the crazy bastard hit me and that now i will get it again of course he was feeling insulted and we were fighting all the time the atmosphere at my work was rather cold not bad but cold and very demanding and i was feeling extremely stressed for no specific reason i was not going out with friend like the previous time i was not going to parties and i was isolating myself in his home after a lot of fighting i decide to go to another place with 2 other flatmates that l literally left the same night i went losing 300 at this point i was just acting like a crazy person every move i was making had no reason and i was in a constant state of stress i returned to his home and after 45 days i quit my job and i went back to greece its been 15 month that i am in the house scared and crying all day feeling extremely guilty that i had another chance to put my life together in the place i want and i just blew it for nothing i feel completely lost i am 29 and i really feel like my life is over i miss this guy very much although he was a stoner that did not do much with his life and i am afraid that my life from now on will be just miserable in greece and nothing more i am desperate,post-pandemic,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

i live in an area that doesnt rain often and due to recent massive rain storms experienced major flooding in certain areas found out that a lot of this was due to storm drains that havent been maintained and therefore clogged with debris this did not allow the excess rain water to be drained and therefore flooded the surrounding area how does this relate to depression i reflected on my own life and recognized that my massive rain storms and excess rain water is the painful childhood struggles i went through rain storms and the amount of emotional pain and tears i felt rain water the problem isnt the occurrence of rain storms and rain water because this happens all the time in the world the problem is a drainage system that isnt working properly when the emotional pain isnt experienced with love and support it can overwhelm us emotional flooding we become stuck and over time can develop depressive symptoms because i was alone with myself i used my own mental efforts to deal with it i developed a negative belief system about myself to reduce the emotional pain if i can convince myself that i am unworthy then i dont have to feel as hurt that people dont love me this would ultimately end up being the debris that blocked me from having the emotional rain water to truly be felt and flow through me by convincing myself that i am unworthy of love i dont have the ability to process the emotional pain i feel inside it stays stuck within me like a buildup of rain water with nowhere to go the real challenge and courage is to believe we are worth of love im learning how to clean up the debris which is my negative selfidentity and radically love and accept the emotional painrain water for what it is without judgement just to feel it for what it is and let it flow through me hope this wasnt too confusing thank you,post-pandemic,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

ive been suffering from depression for more than 15 years and recently for many reasons it gets worse in the year of 2017 my parents asked me to get a masters degree since my previous education was too bad i successfully got enrolled but due to my mental health condition and my social phobia i feel its really hard for me to keep going especially when i compare myself to other rich and happy schoolmates i feel no motivation and no willing to focus on my study i like it but its all because of my family wanted it not me i then realized that i havent done anything for my own good i just fulfill other peoples wish all the time this realization makes me frustrated and feeling hopeless and meaningless so im being suicidal for some months i talked to my mom last month i said if i could quit because i want to restart my own life and try to enjoy i know i mess up my 31 year long life already since i dont have a goal i am just being alive as my parents best obedient kid i see no future no meaning in my life so i want to give up i feel so excited when thinking about death a relief and a method to solve all the pains i talked about these feelings with my mom and dad i hope they can be understanding and supportive but they said no i cant quit before i finish my school also they said if i want to die its better to finish my school first then i can die with a certificate that at least makes them feel good that i did a thing i really want to die as a revenge to them they dont care about me and my problem they said if i die itll be a huge loss and shame for them because their peers would really look down to them but now they seem to know that my depression isnt a made up excuse so they tried to negotiate with me they literally said that i can kill myself if i could at least get the certificate i really let them down all the time they said if i could try at least once i have no friends no relationship no one i could talk to with my problems but i dont think anything will help me out im just super suicidal i cry all day i want to end everything but i hate my moms sad face and crying,post-pandemic,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1

pushing your problems aside will lead to constant depression ive deprived myself of happiness because of the pain i felt distractions arent used for help but to avoid something for a period of time people are depressed for many reasons and most of the time those reasons arent something they were able to control you can look back and reflect all you want but thats it use your problems as an opportunity to a brighter future distractions are fake emotions but opportunities are a gateway to happiness my most recent relationship was ended for a reason i dont know i used distractions as a momentary relief to my problems i was given chances to move on and find positive outcomes but those distractions held me back its been painful but ive found that the opportunities ive been given are endless now im saving money focusing on myself reaching out to people and just living life better the struggle and pain are still there and they will be but ive found happiness in the opportunities i was given not in the distraction i used in the beginning,post-pandemic,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

yup no shit every time i would ever come out as suicidal thats always the first thing they say the crutch for my existence is reliant on others wanting me to struggle in the same foggy waters that ive been struggling in for years i know theyre trying to help but it doesnt help it just guilts me into a corner and leaves me being perpetually sad all the time it leaves me with the impression that if i sever ties with everyone to the point where i am in their eyes irredeemable garbage that maybe ill finally be free from my death causing pain to others at least that was my impression before i realized the hard way that it would only shift the pain from my death to my actions so even if i get lucky and my suicide was clean it will never be painless so for now im trapped there is simply no solution other than think about wanting to die and feeling selfish right after edit i sympathize for the people in this thread whos parents are part of the problem that makes this statement much much worse the people trying to help are effectively assuming that you have the same loving parents and probably tell you things about their parents you would kill to have for one day that sounds like a rusted knife to the chest and im sorry you have to deal with that to people with worthless unsupportiave parents i hope you can get out of that situation as soon as possible and find a support group and i hope the cretins that drive their kids to suicide eventually receive the same torment that they have dished out,post-pandemic,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1

i am afflicted with this disease of being me if i wasnt trans i wouldnt be me ive started to consider being trans as a mental illness because being trans has the exact same effect of just absolutely fucking up every single aspect of my life just like my depression and anxiety except way worse okay maybe the problem is not me being trans but how the society treats mewill treat me does it really matter is it really that important to find where the problem is the way i see it if i wasnt trans things would have been much easier you know i learned how to solve differential equations when i was in 10th grade i was learning complex analysis when people were struggling with polynomials the point is i am smart not that it made any difference you know why trans depressed anxious i spent 7 years in uni not attending classes and instead crying in my room looking at the ceiling hoping i would die i wanted to be a girl so bad i hated that i wanted to be a girl i knew that people hate people like me i thought that something was very obviously wrong with me now i think the same again if i was a girl would i still have depression anxiety of course these things absolutely contributed to my bad choices but the most painful thing for me was being trans i know that i could have made better choices i know people in much worse situations than me were able to make these good choices and try hard to make something of themselves i am responsible for these bad choices i am responsible for not making them again but guess what if i wasnt trans for whatever reason i dont see myself failing in uni or life in general i dont know where i would end up but it certainly would be a much better place than this now i might be in trouble for being trans again hopefully not but who knows i am not going to go into details and like okay i might not be in trouble this time but then what what next is waiting for me because i am afflicted with this curse what do i do ive tried not being trans ive tried antidepressants fuck i am on two of them right now i went through the entire list of ssris snris some tricyclics some atypicals some antipsychotics i am quite certain that i have taken so many psychiatric drugs at this point that if i were to pile them all up they would weigh more than me ive tried therapy i dont have a lot of money but ive had more than about 18 months of theraphy if i combine all of them together i cant not be fucking trans i cant shake this fucking curse off of me because it is literally what makes me who i am so what happens when i get in trouble for being trans the next time people have gotten arrested for not wearing their gender appropriate clothes they have been raped and harassed they literally got doused in gasoline and immolated does these things happen to cis people of course it can happen to anybody but it happens to trans people way more often what do i do now what do i do if my freedom is taken away from me what do i do if i am forced to stop transitioning how the fuck do i live with that this thing this brokenness i cant live with this knowing what that there is something that can help me but i cant do it if it comes to that i think its a sign for me to just die just stop existing it will hurt it will hurt knowing what i could have become what i could have done with my life i just dont see it happening anymore i feel spent ive wasted 27 years of my life being someone who i am not and if i am forced to keep living like that then i am already as good as dead i have what i need for the most part i can get what i dont have easily and quickly i dont know if it will be painful hopefully not i dont want to die but i dont know how i can live if i am not allowed to transition,post-pandemic,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0
edit wow thank you so much everybody i am so grateful please please comment on peoples posts that dont have any comments if you can hope you are all doing well or if not that things get better for you 3 i know this post will be ignored but at least i tried at least i tried to get help from my parents friends school hotlines reddit but nobody wants to help the only person i had left was my bf but yesterday he just said he feels like all he is is a therapist to me it really broke my heart into a million pieces because i dont have anybody else to talk to and he always said it was okay for me to vent to him my parents called me a freak and a weirdo said that i need to snap out of this and get over myself after they saw my stupid blog about my depression when i was 13 idk why i made that 13 yr old me was questionable they got enraged when they saw my self harm at 14 they got really mad the tension in the house and the shame was unbearable i couldnt look at them in the eyes and spent most of my time hiding in my room now i act like im fine and happy all the time we talk about other stuff and joke and laugh together and its massively improved our relationship im grateful to have parents i now get along with but its only because i hide my mental health lately things have gotten so bad its getting hard for me to hide it from them im forgetting to do things they told me to im losing things they lent to me theyre getting pissed off when i didnt mean to im not doing this on purpose got mad because i didnt phone my grandma to thank her for some money of course it came across as rude and i felt so guilty my whole family probably thinks i dont care about them i feel like shit but they dont want to know the truth my friends they all have it bad bad home lives mental health problems every single one of them and im always trying to help them but when i tried to open up they treated it like a competion and didnt even ask what was up with me just said they had it worse i havent spoken to them in weeks because im so depressed and nobody even checks up on me to see how i am its hard to pretend im happy and smiling and laughing so i dont talk to them im not okay but theyre not in the right place to help me they need help themselves its getting really hard to socialise i talk to my boyfriend everyday and its just so so so hard to talk and do normal things with him i try to cover up how bad im hurting but sometimes i crack he said it was okay for me to vent anytime but it looks like i did it too much and he says he feels like a therapy buddy i feel so fucking shit that i cant even get my shit together school is so difficult i log onto my live lessons and sit there and listen to my tutor saying mental health matters guys when their school counsellor wont even bother to show up time and time again the school counsellor has cancelled on me last minute or during class when we cant use our phones or just simply not been there my mental health doesnt fucking matter to the school does it they say its really important we look after our wellbeing so they suggest going out for a walk breathing taking breaths and talking to someone well we already know thats not fucking possible but the other tips are just really basic level things they dont bother to invest deeper into mental health and help people with genuine problems because they might not have superhero parents that can get them to the doctors or therapists they only tell us how to look after our wellbeing when im doing all those things and its gone beyond that im really doing badly and they dont care they just expect you to get on with it so i get told off for not participating in my live lessons well im sorry that i tried to reach out for help because you said mental health matters and yet i got nothing so you now you expect me to act okay and surprise surprise i cant fucking do it i cant switch off my mental health for you school there is no place in school for people like me when they expect you to be motivated high achieving focused participating just always okay and i cant do it and i know this will transfer into the real world the working world they always expect you to be okay and its not like i want to walk around looking all miserable but its just getting so hard to keep that happy mask on all the time i have a university interview coming up soon i dont know if i can do it im so broken and suicidal that i dont think i can act all enthusiastic and persuade them id be a great passionate hardworking student when i can barely do my schoolwork and struggle to even get out of bed dress myself and eat theres so many signs im struggling and nobody cares if youre lucky they will say they do they spit out the cliches give you the useless suicide hotline number and move on with their lives in most circumstances you have to shut up and act like youre okay your whole life there is no place in the world for people like me,post-pandemic,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0

just a warning in case anyone else has been dealing with suicidal ideation please just ignore my post cause i dont want to trigger anyone well where do i begin its been a pretty rough start to the new year at least from a personal level i have never really been a positive or happy person despite what my parents continue to reiterate to me i am pessimistic and for the most part i have gotten use to my outlook on life but even for me it is getting tiring how can i muster up the energy to go outside if all i feel is glaring and judging eyes looking at me how can i go outside and pursue a career when the first thought of putting myself out there is negative judgment i recently graduated from university and for me a person who experienced so much anxiety it was a miracle but now i dont see a step forward what do i do next without the structure of classes i am lost and because of my fear of judgement i just cant muster up the energy to apply for anything i am qualified for i tell my parents and instead of helpful advice i just keep getting bombarded with negative words lecturing me on why i should have a job already why i should have a relationship or why i should be like all the other normal people they see around them doesnt help that my neurodivergence was not detected until i was already an adult and that my neurotypical younger brother is finding life easy and i know that it is easy to say that as an outsider that my golden brother may not find life easy but i know he does today was just another day of me being told what i should be doing how i should be doing things and that i am wasting my life leading me to feel alone and worthless it would be so easy to just cut my arm like i normally do but make it deeper wrap my throat and feel the pressure before darkness takes over but then i feel bitter about what my death would invertible cause my parents lying about who i was a person they never spent time getting to know playing mourning figures when they could never care about me whenwhile i am alive the less than a handful of friends who showed me love remembering the good times but also the bad many of which may never find out about my death because i have such a separation between family and those who i care about the only thing keeping me from ending it all is that fear of being remembered incorrectly being thought of in ways that are fabrications from a parents vanity even now while writing this i am sitting next to a blade knowing full well that one day my self control will be gone and with it so will my life,post-pandemic,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0

even though ive tried to make different changes in my life to move ahead i still feel stuck in the same pit i changed job positions so that i could earn more help build up my savings while living at home and still pay for my share which was going fine for a while until my parents ended up losing their jobs the majority of my money for the last few months has been going towards the house bills and feeding my parents my father cant work anymore because of his health and also has no health insurance he cant even claim disability because he would have to have multiple appointments to reconfirm the conditions that he already has and we simply cant afford that right now im very much stressed out and angered by the situation due to the fact that my parents were well aware of his health and couldve planned better for the situation in my opinion due to the fact that one of the major issues is his sight and their line of work involved driving he shouldve tried to come off the road a while ago the company that they were fired from only seemed to really want to let go of my dad because of the vision issues which they stupidly tried to hide but still offered my mom a position that she immediately start but she declined it saying that she was tired of being completely on the road all the time but the job still left it open for her i just felt a certain amount resentment start to build towards her because this caused her to be out of work for nearly two months and to have an option waiting all this time but simply deciding its not your vibe anymore feels selfish i mentioned before that i trying to save to move out before but this situation has tanked my savings completely and now theyre constantly home making the small house even smaller my room is essentially an atticloft with 3 walls above the living room which wasnt easy before but since they were always on the road it was pretty much calm and quiet majority of the time and the times that theyd be home every other month id just use headphones now its just constant noise yelling nonstop tv and everyones footsteps if i actually want peaceful sleep i have to go into my parents room while they use the living room and even that gets interrupted by them for a multitude of reasons weve tried to work together before to move into a bigger place to where everyone had their own space in the area i was even going to put a good chunk of my money down for the down payment but my parents decided to by land in a far off state on a whim which is completely undeveloped 3 days after i said i would put up the money i was very confused and betrayed because i had a good paying job in the state that were currently in and my brother was in school as well but they simply said we could just move again with them and build our own houses on their land even in the current financial mess that were in theyre still hanging on to that land for some reason the jobs they had before were incredibly high paying and they were very loose with their money they decided to buy a high end car for their everyday car always needed the newest phone or an extra tablet for business and every streaming service plus cable now that car is facing repo it has a bunch of issues that we cant afford to fix or even get looked at and the biweekly payment is falling onto my brother i still dont have a vehicle that was one of things ive been saving up for and it seems like a far off dream now theyve offered to help buy a car for me in the past but i saw how that was held over my brothers heads in the past so i declined they barely helped me get my license in the first place so it just didnt seem reliable im just so tired of this being my constant existence i have dreams skills and hopes for the future i have a deep love of art and the one constant joy i have is seeing how ive improved over time because its the one thing that proves to me that im not just the same person as i was a year ago i have stories that i want to write and dedicate time to but i find it hard to consistently pour time into with what i have going on constantly im usually in some type of pain if its not a crippling period it will be the cold that goes around the office that unfortunately turns into pneumonia for me because of preexisting conditions i have a horrible social life just people from work or past jobs that i message every other month because im so emotionally checked out and one consistent good friend who if im being honest doesnt have much depth to her and says troubling things at times but since shes constant i dont want to lose her i have no love life i just i dont even know why to be honest ive had offers ive tried dates and as self deprecating as i usually am i am completely aware that i am considered very attractive by the normal standards but even so im approaching my late 20s still a virgin there have been times where i tried to set up just getting rid of it by going on the dating apps finding an attractive enough person whos interested and setting up a date but im a coward and i ghost them or i find the littlest thing to pinpoint as a red flag and cut them off then i avoid dating for a while and the cycle repeats itself even when im complimented or flirted with in person i dont know how to respond other than to say thank you and try to move on from the situation if you made it through reading all this i apologize this is years of unhappiness and frustration vomited into words unfortunately therapy is pretty expensive and this the next best thing for right now im not expecting any kind responses i kinda just wanted to put what was happening into words because then it would feel farther away just for a little while thanks i guess i hope that anyone whos going through something similar or worse finds a way out,post-pandemic,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0

i 28f have been with my boyfriend 31m for over two years we own a home and have planned to spend our lives together a year ago my boyfriend decided to go on lexapro because he experiences what his doctor believed to be anxiety attacks once a month at the same time every month please also comment if youve ever heard of something like this the anxiety attacks have continued so his doctor wants him to get off the lexapro and see a psychiatrist to rule out anything going on with his brain because his doctor no longer believes hes experiencing anxiety attacks the downside is that the lexapro has a number of known side effects all of which he has been dealing with the past year since going on them there have been a lot of changes with his behavior and his personality since going on this medication which i have previously posted about when seeking guidance for how to best support him the most recent change is that he believes he no longer wants to have kids he thinks he doesnt want to have kids anymore he says he might change his mind in the future but right now he thinks he doesnt want them this is a complete 180 on his part we had the discussion about kids very early on in our relationship and he said he wanted them and would do whatever it took to be a dad ie ivf surrogacy etc he is also an uncle and is amazing with his nieces and nephews even as recent as 6 months ago he was talking about looking forward to having kids with me as a symptom of his depression he doesnt want to do anything anymore so this change doesnt completely surprise me and is part of the reason im hesitant to fully believe it at the same time i want to make it clear i would never pressure him into doing something he doesnt want to do if he doesnt want kids i wont have kids with him what im trying to figure out is if this medication can be contributing to this sudden change before i decide what i want to do i love kids my entire career revolves around kids i have always wanted to be a mom with that said ive shared some of his doubts about that major life change such as finances the state of our world stress etc however i still come out wanting to be a mom and so did he until recently i now have to decide what i want to do with this information i dont want to discredit him but there have been so many changes since hes gone on lexapro that its hard to tell whats real and whats the lexapro has anyone faced these changes as a result of depressionanxiety or ssris,post-pandemic,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

over the years i feel like i struggle to learn anything new it makes me extremely depressed because it applies to virtually everything but the most frustrating thing is how it affects the things that i enjoy the main example is car audio i got really into the car audio scene back in high school mid to late 90s i was always messing around with my stereo system but was never able to do anything other than the most basic of installs despite being in wood shop all four years of high school i still have trouble building a simple speaker enclosure last year i tried to replace the radio in my truck and despite having what i was told was everything i needed i still couldnt figure it out luckily the company has a very generous return policy and i was able to return everything ive again been getting the itch to upgrade and have spent multiple hours the past few weeks pouring over information and still havent the foggiest clue on how to do it correctly its the same with other things im interested in ive been a big fan of strongman and working out in general for a long time but unlike fans of other sports that can rattle off statistics i couldnt tell you who won worlds strongest man last year let alone who won it ten years ago i also cant design a workout routine to save myself and feel like i have no clue what im doing in the weight room ive been at my current job for just over a year theres a lot involved in it food manufacturing and while i know a lot more than i did when i started i still go in every day wondering what im going to screw up today because i forget to do a step or figure something wrong theres people that started shortly before me or have come in after me that seem like they picked right up on things and im still struggling to understand things a year later i was an average student in school with the exception of math which i always struggled with i never failed any math classes but i always had average or below average grades in high school at least tried going back to college twice and dropped out both times because it felt like i wasnt learningretaining anything i also did a technical school for two years in construction technology buy can only do the absolute basics of home improvement and maintenance replace electrical outletsswitches patch small holes in walls etc i just feel like im too stupid to learn anything and i cant get good at things because i give up because everything seems too hard for me and its making me even more depressed than i usually am,post-pandemic,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0

i spent over a decade battling terrible anhedonia anxiety and depression i felt like i didnt enjoy anything and life was utterly meaningless fatigued 247 i tried a bunch of individual meds but nothing seemed to work until recently i finally found a combination that works for me adderall and prozac turns out feeling tired all the time is also a symptom of adhd the prozac gives me serotonin which seems to result in enough internal peace that i dont feel afraid to die every minute of the day the adderall then gives me dopamine keeping me just motivated and anxious enough that i can emulate normal existence life feelspretty okay which is so so so much better than living in a personal psychological hell i also found that ditching caffeine and alcohol helped immensely they were contributing to the ups and downs that made it harder to appreciate my meds impact theres hope out there for you my friends try meds try combinations of meds give them time enough to work it took 2 months for the prozac to fully settle in but if they dont move on ditch recreational drugs if you can your brain is lying to you about the worthlessness of life i promise you your brain is just too deprived of happy chemicals to realize it keep fighting my friends love you all,post-pandemic,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

hi everyone i have been diagnosed with depression for years but that was done in 2014 maybe 3 times by 3 different doctors and nothing since im starting to think maybe i have adhd or cptsd i was told once a year ago about cptsd by a doc and told i have that once i cannot focus on anything for a long period of time unless its my job so be it reading a book video games a movie going out somewhere walking around exploring fishing none of it hits that itch in the brain where you go this is fun this is challenging i will feel good when i get it done or this isnt fun or challenging but i feel like im progressing achieving for context in 2022 my wife decided to leave me in december 2022 she left the country uk back to norway shes norwegian and took our 2 kids with her my childhood was shit parents where abusive and violent never really fit in with most people had barely any friends certainly no close ones when i met my wife in 2010 it was on a rocky start and it didnt feel right she was with another guy who was friends with me online and i met him and a bunch of other friends once at a lan party week in norway after i left she somehow got my number and kept in touch with me and on many occasions she was flirting and pursuing me and i told her to cut it out every time but she wore me down and i accepted what was happening and we ended up together i lost that friendship with that guy and everyone else at that lan party but i got this woman always sat wrong with me was never even that attracted to her to begin with by 2014 the depression hit real bad on a nervous breakdown and i ended up on prescription meds for example i love call of duty mobile among other games on steam on my laptop and gaming in my childhood was my safe space a way to escape from all the abuse and violence at home but i cannot focus on it i will play one or 2 matches that are only 10 mins long and thats it im done my brain cannot take it anymore and that is the same with most things unless it involves my job earning money is there some way to get out of that is there a medication for people who cannot concentrate focus much thanks,post-pandemic,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

first ever post on reddit so apologies for any formatting errors i 20f am a classic example of a psychology student who was wanting a diagnosis rather than a degree but am now in too deep i have just finished my second year of an undergraduate degree and am hanging on by a thread my doctor has given me a prescription for zoloft to treat anxiety and depression furthermore my psychologist has referred me to a psychiatrist to look into further medication for adhd today i intended to go to a pharmacy and pick up the zoloft i parked the car and worked myself into an anxiety attack by overthinking i guess the purpose of this post is to be a platform for me to express my resistance and potentially gain advice from others who have been on zoloft or another type of ssri before side effects ive heard a lot about brain fog weight gain and insomnia i already exist in a perpetual state of brain fog if that gets worse i genuinely dont think ill be able to drive continue university or safely go horseback riding the only thing i do outside of work and uni with weight gain i really dont trust my friends and family to be kind about it id probably feel so much worse i feel like insomnia is self explanatory what if it doesnt work i will have wasted the time of three different medical professionals lost a significant amount of money i would have followed the directions given to me only to have to continue to take them until i am weaned off them ultimately i would feel like i have manipulated those who are close to me into believing theres something wrong rather than im just lazy and thats why i dont get out of bed and fail half of my classes what if it does work then ive spend the last five years in a numb and apathetic state ive lost so many people close to me because ive ghosted them when in in a depressive episode and never reached out to them since i was 18 i had just graduated and would have lost the capacity to experience life as an adult i could have done so much better in high school essentially ive wasted my adolescence personality change i know that im different to how i was as a child younger me was vibrant and i afraid to voice my opinions that girl had the world at her feet nowadays im known to be quiet aloof and disinterested in the world around me but thats how people know me i dont know how id cope if i suddenly change for the better and my support system turned around and dislikes me at my best alcohol i am in the cohort that is turning 21 this year thats a huge deal for my friends all advice ive been given says under no circumstances drink while on zoloft which sucks because i hardly ever leave the house and as stated before wouldnt be able to drink i feel like id just be on the sidelines uncomfortable and watching the people i love having fun i just keep spiralling to the point where i dont know if i can do it sorry its long i just started typing and didnt stop thanks to those who read,post-pandemic,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

do you ever look at yourself in the mirror and think about death you think about the consequences of it and what peoples views are on it maybe you have even considered suicide you brush it off most likely that is what most people do people are scared i am scared who would actually want to die though right this is what casually being suicidal is can you have suicidal thoughts and want to die at the same time i have a fear of death i always have always will how is it that some days i want everything to end but i dont at the same time its my biggest fear but also my biggest relief my biggest wish in reality i just want the pain to stop why is everything so difficult sure you would tell me to go get therapy go get tested by a psychologist or something as if that advice means anything you want to label us as if everyone feels the same thing people like this are the same in some ways sure they are but most people dont want to die they want it to stop what exactly do they want to stop people people are predictable what other reasons are there for someone to want to go as far as think these awful thoughts even good people turn bad everyone is bad even me people tell you to talk to others about these feelings that it will help but only people who experience these kinds of thoughts would understand and even then it would give them this negative thing to relate to is that really a good thing to relate in wanting to die back to my point what can people do i cant call myself depressed because im not sad all the time i cant say i have anxiety because im not anxious all the time it goes on the point of this paragraph is to say dont tell people to ask for advice or say that you understand what they are going through i always tell people what im going through they brush it off talking about it can help but only for the right people for people like me i dont exactly know if i have specific mental health to blame everything on im just feeling like this thats all x200b x200b for all the comments im sorry i cant reply to them all but i will try to when i get round to it but i want to say this now for anyone who will be reading in the future please feel free to pm me ill always reply didnt realise this would blow up but it is nice to know people feel the same way i hope you find some sort of comfort in that as i do stay safe someone shared this link with me if you want you can read it,post-pandemic,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0
24 years old no love life whatsoever kissless virgin socially inept insecure suicidal on and off but i was working hard on myself and felt i had made tremendous improvements over the past few months and believed i was on the road to recovery by myself thought i was finally in a good spot met this girl off tinder well call her jenny for privacy sake have been on plenty of tinder dates in the past so wasnt expecting much i have never clicked with a girl like i did this one down to earth funny unique flirty cute checked boxes i didnt even know i had i struggled the entire date with being awkward and nervous and she was still so cool about it towards the end when i was sure she was going to leave and ghost me she said she was still waiting for a kiss i was on cloud 9 after the date then the insecurities and mental illness i thought i was working past returned in overdrive over the next few days i made stuff up lied trying to figure some stuff out for insecurities gas lit her was an absolute horrible human being lied some more and chased her away assumed she was talking to other dudes which even if she was it would have been none of my business thought the energy between us changed after the date even though texting habits never changed and we were still talking got immediately unhealthily attached and ruined everything caused by my own insecure insanity and actions all of that work i thought i did to help myself was a ruse this gave me the rude awakening that i was never okay and that i needed help i was in the best mental spot id been at in years and a single date with a one of a kind girl that i single handedly ruined afterwards due to my own undiscovered traumas was enough to bring me from the top of the mountain i recently climbed back down to near suicide at the drop of a dime it gave me the insight and fortitude to reach out to ones i thought no longer loved me for help and with their support and professional help i am doing what i once thought was impossible and could never do it is getting better the feeling this girl gave me regardless of how my mental illnesses ruined it afterwards inspired me that there is hope there are things worth living for but you just might not be in the right state to find them it is extremely pathetic to let something so small such a short relationship with someone i barely knew impact me so heavily but i will use this experience to learn from my mistakes and make my life worth living thank you jenny,post-pandemic,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0

i was my mums carer from 13 onwards because she suffered from alcoholism depression and severe anxiety uswell as anorexia and i dedicated 4 years of my life to her afterwards i gave up on school gave up on friends i was just living to keep her living and it caused me to get very depressed to the point where about a year ago my dad was forced to take me out of her care due to me being neglected and deeply depressed and then when i moved in i had a phew happy days thinking life was gonna get better but i quickly realised i felt like i was nothing if i wasnt taking care of her so id sleep all day then go see her for an hour then come home and sleep again and it continued like that for about 8 months and my dad cares but doesnt really know what to do he has his own problems and so does everyone else in my life and they just expect me to power through it but ive lost all ambition in life and i decided that keeping my mum alive was my ambition then around august i wanted to start doing more for myself so started focusing on me a bit more and then one day i walked in to visit my mum and found her dead on the floor i just remember screaming and crying and then my family showed up and took me home after my mum was took to the crematorium and we got really drunk and ever since then im lost i have no ambition no dreams no path no guidance nothing and im trying to be happy and just get through it and start living life for myself but im worthless i gave that many years to my mum that i have no skills no qualifications so i just got stuck deeper into a depression that i feel like nobody wants to acknowledge im going through and i have to keep making myself strong to help my brothers get through stuff or to make my dad and my stepmum feel like there not failing at being a parent but deep down i feel like everyone is failing me including myself but i refuse to die because i didnt go through all this shit just to die so i start working with my dad thinking if i just put my energy into something i can prove to myself that im good enough but i just kept making mistakes and it made me realise even more how much im failing and then due to putting all my energy into working i dont have any energy to spare and give to my bf or my brothers so now i feeling like im failing there us well and i just want to sleep all day and i just want to hope that tomorrow wont exist but it will and as tomorrow comes ill still be worthless and still feel like im failing and it makes me wonder what am i ment to do the more i try and do better for myself the worse i feel about myself the less i do for myself the more worthless i feel its gotta get better eventually but im almost 18 and i feel like im still stuck at 13 and i feel like nobody knows how to help so im stuck trying to work it out on my own thank you if you read all of this its more of a rant but i needed to let someone know how im feeling before it eats away at me,post-pandemic,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0
if your a transphobe dont even bother commenting ive been closeted for a year now and i finally realized that no one accepts me everyone still thinks im a boy so they make fun about my girly appearance and my lack of interest in manly stuff and when i look out into the world and not my personal life i see so many people that hate that i exist that try to take away who i am and on top of that i was already extremely depressed but i was never suicidal at this point its becoming a chore to wake up and to look at myself in the mirror and to tell myself that i love myself there used to be days where i could and some where i couldnt but now it seems like i dont even want to wake up anymore its not even like an active thought like i used to think it would be its just a tiredness from living its sounds stupid but i literally just want to sleep forever but i dont want to die like if i could put my life on pause and just stop for a minute im assuming im gonna get some dickhead in the comments saying that trans people should be killed or some shit because they always say that and just know that i dont care anymore transphobia at this point only annoys me slightly im not gonna let some random reddit comment try to invalidate me when i can barely get the energy to smile i feel truly alone i know that im not i have many friends and family members and a girlfriend but they wont and will never understand what its like to be me or to be trans ive been battling addiction for like 3 years now and at this point i dont see an end im not planning on doing any harmful drugs but my moto when i was a kidno joke was that if im gonna end my life i would try harder drugs before i do that what the fuck am i typing i hate how casual this sounds to me i was 12 when i first thought that im to poor to afford a therapist and when i was going to get one my parents never followed through so now i look for comfort through the support of people online and drugs since no one cares about my feelings and no one can know im trans i dont think i am going to end my life at all but this tiredness of living is so degrading idek what this post was about originally but i needed to say all of that hopefully i dont get to scared and delete this i think its important to see how homophobia and transphobia affect us and the youth,post-pandemic,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1
being alone with my thoughts is so awful its painful and difficult and i have absolutely no control i just ruminate on so many painful memories i get trapped in thought spirals affirming all of these awful assessments ive made about myself in the wake of primarily trauma and abuse but theres a lot of elements of truth to them and i cant really avoid thinking about them or that unless i manage to avoid thinking at all i just wake up and do the bare minimum to exist and often times dont even achieve that as i dwell in self neglect and pour every minute o can into video games until im exhausted enough to pass out within minutes of laying down because if i dont then ill lay in bed for hours making myself even more miserable this is so awful and so difficult and it feels impossible to do anything about it i am in hell,post-pandemic,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1
i literally have no joy in my life i had to stop drinking alcohol a year ago because i had a severe pancreatitis attack that almost killed me the only time i didnt care about being in a relationship was when i was drunk now ive been sober for a year and i was in a relationship with a guy who cheated on me with his ex and emotionally abused me for 4 months i ended that in december i havent had any joy since ive only been on 4 dates this year and the guys always ghost me cause i trauma dump on them and tell them how badly i want marriage and a baby im 28 and live with my parents so i feel like a failure that only a man and baby can fix even my dog doesnt bring me joy anymore i want a real human baby and a man that will save me from my misery my therapist isnt helping coda meetings arent helping and my dbt group makes me feel inadequate because everyone seems to already have a partner i need a man so bad the idea of being single at 29 is killing me i do have bpd as well is this my bpd or codependency fucking with me,post-pandemic,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1

i used to self sabotage and act rather callously i still do somewhat although ive become more mindful when i used to feel depressed i felt like i had a reason like my anxiety or the fact that i drank too much last night or that i was self deprecating all day or because i spokeacted on impulse and suffered the consequences while i still have very bad anxiety my medication has started effectively dampening it ive also started having fewer ideations in general and ive been trying my hardest for the first time in my life to help myself get better i stopped drinking almost completely i sometimes have onemonth when my friends do illicit activities i opt out ive taken away specific triggers ive found a way to hold myself to a flexible eating schedule but im noticing that by doing all of these good things i am starting to feel worse because despite everything i am still depressed i cannot stand in a single place doing nothing without feeling it i cant go to work without feeling it i cant have a day off without feeling it and its causing some of the worst thoughts to start coming back except this time i dont have a crutch and i still dont have any motivation or hope for the future is there anybody here who has gotten better after trying to reroute their life is it possible,post-pandemic,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

with me update 3416 the first girl i didnt fully realize how much she was suffering because she was good at hiding it but i knew something was wrong the other two girls were dirtier and worse and they didnt even try to hide that they were sad it was already too late they were gone if i tried to help them they would have laughed at me and told me to get out i mean yeah i could have tried but the main point is that i got a reference between the first girl and the other two and i saw where she was heading so i had to help her in regards to what i did ever since then i contacted a bunch of websites to help against prostitution one being called cash community against sexual harm and talked to one of the employees who was a survivor and got her number i texted my girl a huge text message in hoping to get her to call that number but she didnt reply i just hope she calls that number and turns her life around wow i changed alot reading my first paragraph is

this is getting extremely out of hand it is impossible to make any uplifting antidepression posts on other subs because so many people are depressed and have become content with it to the point of it clouding their judgment even all of my antidepression posts on any sub so far have been downvoted to hell and back but of course all my unrelated memes are doing fine i dont even care about the likes now i just want to cheer someones day up,pre-pandemic,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1

this is something close to my heart and the reason for this is because i was someone who woke up one day and just couldnt recognise the person i was becoming i hated everything that my life was turning into i used to wake up 5 minutes before i had to leave to go to work slap some makeup on the train and run my fingers through my hair to comb iti felt as though i was like some dead zombie just walking around i never went outi stopped caring about how i was dressing how i looked and how rude i was to people so how did i get here well i think it was due to a series of disappointments and let downs life is just bullshit really it really is so what i did one day was i woke up and i just said thats it ive had enough im taking back the control so i quit the job i hated and just took one big risk leap i saw it as me jumping ship onto the floaty i started a little challenge whereby i would try and do things differently everyday for 2 weeks things that i would never do buy or wear the first thing was i would start taking more care of myself so i started getting up every morning and blowdrying my hair like i was going to the emmys then i started doing all these skin care treatments to my face and body i saw a naturapath and i quit smoking i got acupuncture for the first time i went to a mud bath for the first time i started wearing makeup everyday which i never did and this one changed everything i started wearing high heels in the day time and as stupid as this may sound it really worked it changed everything in my life it had such a profound affect on everything i changed the way i was dressing and this changed the way people were reacted to me as soon as i woke up in the morning i would have this little routine where i would glam myself up and it made me feel amazing people saw me as having this amazing confidence which i didnt but it sure was growing and people would constantly come up to pay me compliments complete strangers really random things like i love that nail polish did i see you at the balenciaga show what do you do people started looking at me seeing me differently and the best thing about it all was i was having fun i was loving this new outlook this change of perspective i was loving that i was reconnecting with my femininity i felt like i was living and so i wanted to share this because it helped me try it people if youre sick of feeling like crap take control back do the stiletto apprenticeship challenge see how it changes your life i hope it can help you like it did me my collegue did this with her best friend who was going through a divorce they did it together and had a blast with it for two weeks they would set little challenges like they would wear nothing but big diamante earrings for 2 weeks or have a week where they would wear red lipstick,pre-pandemic,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1

we understand that most people who reply immediately to an op with an invitation to talk privately mean only to help but this type of response usually leads to either disappointment or disaster it usually works out quite differently here than when you say pm me anytime in a casual social context we have huge admiration and appreciation for the goodwill and good citizenship of so many of you who support others here and flag inappropriate content even more so because we know that so many of you are struggling yourselves were hard at work behind the scenes on more information and resources to make it easier to give and get quality help here this is just a small start our new wiki page explains in detail why its much better to respond in public comments at least until youve gotten to know someone it will be maintained at rdepressionwikiprivatecontact and the full text of the current version is below summary anyone who while acting as a helper invites or accepts private contact ie pms chat or any kind of offsite communication early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement either way its unwise to trust them pm me anytime seems like a kind and generous offer and it might be perfectly wellmeaning but unless and until a solid rapport has been established its just not a wise idea here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately by posting supportive replies publicly youll help more people than just the op if your responses are of good quality youll educate and inspire other helpers the 1990 rule applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet people who are struggling with serious mentalhealth issues often justifiably have a low tolerance for disappointment and a highlevel of everchanging emotional need unless the helper is able to make a 100 commitment to be there for them in every way for as long as necessary offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good this is why mentalhealth crisisline responders usually dont give their names and callers arent allowed to request specific responders its much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole analogously its much safer and healthier for our ops to develop a relationship with the community as a whole even trained responders are generally not allowed to work highintensity situations alone its partly about availability but its mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue if a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mentalhealth issues including suicidality which is often comorbid with depression escalate in a pm conversation its much harder for others including the rdepression and rsuicidewatch moderators to help contrary to common assumptions moderators cant see or police pms in our observation over many years the people who say pm me the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mentalhealth issues and mentalhealth support we all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively community input mitigates these limitations theres no reason why someone whos truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny if helpers are concerned about their own privacy keep in mind that selfdisclosure when used supportively is more about the feelings than the details and that we have no problem here with the use of altthrowaway accounts and have no restrictions on account age or karma we all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others these people do want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims there are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mentalhealth issues if a helper invites an op to talk privately and gives them a good supportive experience theyve primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers this sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someones in a state of mentalhealth crisis when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning if ops want to talk privately posting on a wideopen anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option although we dont recommend it we do allow ops to request private contact when asking for support if you want to do this please keep your expectations realistic and to have a careful look at the history of anyone who offers to pm before opening up to them,pre-pandemic,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

ive been really stubborn about seeing someone for my chronic depression but for a while now my meds just havent been helping and i started spiraling out of control getting the energy to see someone about it besides my gp has been tough im sure you know the feeling of being sure that your problems are pointless and not worth speaking about and burdening someone with them haha through pressuring from my so im trying to make the attempt to see a psychologist anyway i had my second appointment with my therapist today and we did a really great activity that appealed to me a lot i want to pass it on to people who also have a hard time speaking to someone about their depression but could use a new and creative coping strategy i think its a great tactic for very creative people to use like artists and writers and visual thinkers so think of yourself like the captain of a ship imagine your boat imagine yourself behind the wheel imagine the ocean youre sailing through depending on how deep you are in your depression you might be close to land or far out in the deep sea on this boat are your monsters the feelings and thoughts you most frequently have personified whenever you start to feel a depressive episode those monsters try to take control of the ship they try to distract you from sailing towards your goals in life their goal is to overwhelm you totally so you let go of the wheel give up and drift forever into the sea in the activity i had to describe and name the worst and most familiar monsters on my ship the ones that were created from my most horrible and frequent doubts what did they look like what did they smell like what did they whisper to me and how did it affect me i had to give them a name and personify them and then i had to come up with an idea of how to banish them off my boat so i could continue steering i imagined had two really nasty monsters on my boat which was sailing through the arctic ice burgs one was huge and long and sinuous with hundreds of arms like a centipede it was completely black with no eyes and a gaping hungry mouth with neon green dripping insides it had rings of saw like teeth going into its body he was scary and intelligent and malevolent he had the consistency of oil and reeked of petrol and what he said to me was give up youve lost your ambitions youll never get to the place you want in life youll never be successful youve lost your chance just give up we decided that the way to destroy it was to set it on fire its made of oil and petrol after all right and petrol is used as fuel fuel for my desires and motivations so setting it alight was this sort of cathartic and ironic way to reclaim my ambitions i had another monster a huge leviathan that came up from the deep sea underneath my ship to try and swallow me it was mindbogglingly massive like an eldritch whale it was my because of your upbringing your poverty the abuse you suffered youll never have the headstart and the privilege that others better off have and youll never have those experiences of safety youll never be able to succeed when there are others out there that are better than you it was an angry violent envious monster the way i fought it was shooting a harpoon down its throat like my moby dick but we decided that it was simply to big to kill it was too powerful id always have it lurking close to me a shadow just under the water so we could belittle it make it small trap it like a fish in a tank others have it so much more worse than me and they do incredible things i have a home and food and shelter if they can succeed so can i as you can see i really got into it it put some of my worst thoughts out there into a creature that was almost tangible instead of just ugly horrible feelings that i often couldnt understand or come to grips with it made them less scary and more familiar and mine i can say hey crippling doubt and inadequacy how are you today you look so cute and get on with my life it was fun to create these ideas and then realize that what i decided to make them out of made them easily fightable like the snake monster made of flammable liquid the ways to defeat them seemed suddenly really clear and easy as an artist im considering drawing out these ideas and characters to really make them tangible a little like an art therapy thing maybe expand out my other issues into monsters as well i thought for similar visual creative people like me this might help you tackle your own monsters because i feel like putting these feelings at a distance and giving them an identity makes it easier to understand and define and battle them,pre-pandemic,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

so im not really sure what i expect from posting on here but being able to anonymously vent what i need im getting burnt out in general of my love life i know im not the only one everyone has a different situation but i feel like my love life couldnt possibly get any worse i want to be able to say positive things about the man i love on here i want the world to know how much i love him i want him to know how much i love him some background info im 20 female hes 21 male weve been dating off and on since 8th grade and were engaged to get married last year but the wedding fell through due to reasons id rather not discuss hes in the airforce and i just graduated with my ba current problem currently i dont even know why i should bother getting up in the morning we arent officially together because we got into a fight 4 days ago and broke up he told me he needed space but we could still act like were together the real problem is that his idea of space is talking to me for about 3 minutes total all day then hanging out with his friends the rest of the time i need to explain that typically we would call each other when we were in the car with down time we would sleep on skype every night and text each other sweet things and updates on what were doing all the time we would even help each other pick out our clothes for each other like we were actually there right now were at the point where hell just tell me hes basically deleted me from his life except for when its convenient for him he doesnt tell me its revenge for mistakes ive made in the past but i feel like thats part of it i think another part is that the military has just made him forget whats important i havent seen my man on good terms since august of last year we saw each other in january but he had some issues that he still cant explain and we didnt have a good time i tried making plans to see him in may but the only time i could get off was his 21st birthday which was the weekend we were supposed to be getting married and he didnt want me there since i couldnt go out to drink i just feel like we go through these ups and downs of him needing his space which means he completely ostracizes me from his life and makes his friends priority i feel guilty that i have to feel like its a competition but i also cant help but feel that the past has made me feel this way i just wish hed be more understanding i wish i had moved there as soon as i was out of school so we could give each other a fair chance right now hes out drinking and watching movies with his friends having his distance im at work crying because i dont mean as much to the man i love as i thought i did i hope he knows that ill still love him a year from now even if we arent together,pre-pandemic,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0

first im sorry if this isnt the place to put this i couldnt find anywhere else that i thought would let me talk about this its really eating me up tonight slow deep breath so the tldr is that im in love with my girlfriend an amazing woman but i also still love my wife ive been with my wife for 7 years now dated for a year engaged for 2 married 4 but sex has always been something i thought could use a little more something plus i didnt get much of it she says its not that she doesnt want to but that shes always so tired after working all day then she says that its because she has to say no so often that its easier to say no than to just have sex we would often go two to three months without any sexual contact two years ago i reconnected with a friend from college we went to a reunion mixer thing and just chatted went to a bar afterwards with some friends and got kinda flirty then texted each other after and within a couple days we were basically sexting a few more days and we had sex for the first time we agreed that it could only be sex and we could meet up as often as needed since we were both in committed relationships already but we could never catch feels or we would have to cut it off we did cut it off twice and one night i got drunk alone and told her how i felt i told her that i wanted whatever it is we had with all the complications attached so we were in a relationship at that point i guess now im really truly in love with this woman and want to be with her all the time but i still love my wife too and my depression makes it worse i dont feel guilt in the typical sense i feel guilty that i dont feel guilty and i feel torn like i should be choosing one but i feel like i need both i feel like i should be ending with a question but i just really want to talk about it,pre-pandemic,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

ive only ever had one friend in my life ive tried to make more but people hate me ive gone to community events parties hobby shopsetc to meet people people just dont seem to click with me im seen as odd annoying weird to name a few things ive been called the only person i can call a friend is my wife and i still do not understand how that came along she just gave me a chance and looked at my oddities a little different earlier this year my wife discovered i have never had a birthday party i never really had any friends to have a party so i just never tried to have one she said that was an injustice and i should have a party and invite friends from facebook she decided to throw me a party a few weeks ago we planned it out for a month made all the decorations by hand hand cooked all the snacks and food even made our own party games to play sent out invitations to people on my facebook her friends we even got rsvps back it all seemed like my first birthday party would be fun i was hopeful coming up on the day then the day of the party happened we rushed to get it all finished before the party start and we were excited the party start time came and 30 minutes later no one was here no big problem everyone always comes to a party late 2 hours later still no one came i started to eat my snacks by myself we got various excuses throughout the night i got sick stuff has come up car isnt starting no babysitters my boss just called me in my wife went to bed early she was upset and mad i told her its ok i am strong outwardly for her i dont want her to feel bad no one likes me but i am being eaten up alive i am now in my 30s and i cant ever said ive had a true friend other than my wife of course im thankful she gave me a chance i dont know what is wrong with me or why i seem to be broken i never should have had this party because ever since then i just cant get it out of my head everyone time i would say outloud to my wife or family they would tell me dont say that plenty of people are your friends youre just being negative now my wife truly sees what i mean if i would have just told my wife no to the party she wouldnt have been upset and id still be ignoring the problem of me being friendless edit everyone thank you for all of the birthday wishes trying to get through replies and messages didnt expect this many messages thank you all again edit 2 i see a lot of messages telling me to be thankful for my wife i am very thankful for her she is the best thing that has ever happened in my life and im the best that ever happened in hers we have been through everything together even homelessness that being said i feel as if she isnt enough socially for me we are 2 different people and even though we share a lot of interests we do not share all of them sometimes it is nice to have other friends to share your other interests with too example she hates the show its always sunny in philadelphia she hates it to a point that if i watch it it should be on my pc with headphones so she doesnt need to hear it i do it because i can understand it frustrates her but i love the jokes so much and i see random stuff in the world and laugh because it reminds me of iasip but i have no one to share it with except the subreddit,pre-pandemic,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1
for lack of better word though maybe im just some tyke in crisis over hyping their predicament if i may id like to tell my story to accompany my thoughts with i was born in the deep southern portions of the united states my mother being an immigrant from cuba what i could remember from my years in the swampish area were some of my happiest days my mother still a young women who had a child at the age of 18 was stricken by severe wanderlust traveling the world while i tagged along something im still a tad bitter about today as i envy others who have childhood friends as a result ive come to learn various cultures forced acceptance and became trilingual however my mother did teach me some irrational things things that despite my knowing better today i still cant rid of as if instinct the most ingrained teaching was the xenophobic attitude i was supposed to adopt to in my mothers defense keep myself safe as a younger child i was obviously naive outgoing and made friends on the fly as time went on and traveling became more frequent i grew jaded and noticed the futility of forming binds that would get broken afterwards thoughts not exactly snuffed out by said mothers preaches of how anything outside is bad and people out there mostly want to harm me of course this made me only rely on my mother my father not having been able to make it to the boat that carried mother off to the states this is another point i carry some venom with as this woman whom ive come to trust explicitly and totally began to beat me regularly until the age of roughly fourteen i grew terrified of her and to this day i dread being in her presence despite my growing significantly stronger than her to the point where a blow from her felt more like an aggravated childs thrash than an adults swing shortly after this age i caught my mother on the phone admitting to a friend that she was growing frustrated that i began to shrug off the abuse having grown too big to hit severely damaging my initial theory that she had stopped simply out of regret rather than frustration this is for lack of better term the endgame of those results and who i am as a person now is someone i am horridly dissatisfied with and i often dream of getting another chance at life only to be brought back down that i simply have what i have and it wont change retroactively as for the noticeable traits and what ive been trying to change distaste for the public in the sense that i very easily if not immediately hate complete strangers for trivial or sometimes no reason at all my smaller circle of friends jokingly refer to this as hating someone for daring to exist in the same dimension i find the joke amusing actually explosive temper is another trait im not fond of we have a friend who is mad often almost all the time really but hes inoffensive and seems to be only blowing off steam in a continuous nonviolent stream whereas i continuously muscle through things and roll with the punches and all the fuses blow leading to a short term but fairly surprising amount of rage this became worrisome to me when even said grouchy fellow was found trying his best to cool my jets trouble trusting sometimes in even my closest of few friends as sometimes im unsure if they truly enjoy my company or keep me out of pity as they are known bleeding hearts fear of being a burden as well as a rather poor opinion of myself is something i regularly deal with often afraid im dragging others down and feeling at the ready to dispose or detach myself from the group which at times puts others on edge i apparently have quite the sacrificial streak which has been said could be admirable were it not so vain i suppose this is more a rant than anything else and a way to feel like i put myself out there and lifted a load from my chest despite my frustration with life i have at least crossed suicide off as an option be it out of cowardice or discomfort as being only remembered as the stranger in the room if remembered at all im not really certain what to say beyond this and truly hope i didnt break any rules i only wanted to confide in you lovely droplets of rain kind enough to comfort but not close enough to harm if youve read through all this you have my unending gratitude in accepting this gibberish in your mind you people make the net and the world a better place,pre-pandemic,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

as someone who has dealt with intense depression that runs in the family for years i have to say most of the posts here are just people claiming they have it the worst with no real plan to get better most people here seem to love wallowing in each others depression not doing a damn thing about it when someone gives advice such as start keeping a journal go on a walk before bed try and find something you enjoy and spend time getting better at it the only response they get is wow thanks you cured my depression s or something to the tune of dude you dont know me my depression is much worse than anybody elses guys it gets fucking draining perhaps the reason you are depressed is because youre so god damn lazy,pre-pandemic,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1

maybe not done but as close as ive ever been me 33m wife 33f married 11 years met when we were 19 2 kids both under 7 she never dealt with her childhood abuse until about a year ago when it became unavoidable s hit the fan when our oldest was born the wife was hit with post pardem sorry for spelling long story short the saturday morning when she begged me to take her to the er at 5am because her insides were shaking finally forced her to start seeking help yeah i wanted to leave her there and go home but they would not let me leave with my own kid and i was not going to let the county take my kid the er forced her to see a shrink before she was discharged but that just started the 5 year path to today lots of crappy stuff happened but finally she told her doc about her abuse it was to the point i was dragging her to a marrage councilor just to try to get her to open up her shrink decided my wife has ptsd so shes been on and off all sorts of pills some have been better than others but none of them have really been good im sorry but i really dont think the answer is just the right handful of pills some made her lactate some made the depression worse some made her drunk some made her manic and now the new ones make her sleep all the time we have 2 kids and she was asleep from noon to 2 then fell asleep agsin around 6 and hasnt woke up its almost 8 on sunday night im going to put the kids down in a little bit and she wont get her ass up off the couch until at least 7 or 8 tomorrow morning im just done she has never kept a job for more than about 6 months even though she has a masters degree a masters degree she doesnt keep house she doesnt cook she dosent seem to want to get better unless its by way of a new handfull of pills this isnt good for the kids and it cant be good for me im sorry but i dont think she wants to get better i dont think i can help her anymore sorry for the rant,pre-pandemic,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0

depression its that topic we dont like to talk about particularly when it comes to ourselves ive been living with depression for about ten years now and those of you who know what its like know that the struggle is real depression for me took on a new level when i became a mum for the first time then a second time and then again a third time i wish i could say that 90 of my days were great and only 10 were down days but unfortunately that is not my reality nor the reality for many others out there living with depression is hard living with depression as a parent well for me it often feels like mission impossible i love my kids more than anything in this world but sometimes its scary its scary because there are days where i feel so down and so helpless that i think about the relief i would feel if i was miraculously not to wake in the morning depression has a way of weakening you and it can take every ounce of your being to get back on your feet i have long accepted the fact that depression is a part of my life and that trying my best is all i can ever do loving my children with all my heart and supporting them in every way i am able is all i can ever do these days im very much pro counseling meaning im all for seeking help both professional and nonprofessional ive seen numerous counselors over the years and based on my own experiences i can say that there is real power in talking about your feelings along with any thoughts that may be troubling you i absolutely recommend giving it a go if you havent already or even if you have being on a pharmaceutical regimen has and continues to help me but as you may already know there is no cure for depression i wish there was my kids and i dont live by a lot of structure why well i feel life can easily become rigid mundane and lack spontaneity but mostly its because i find the idea of maintaining a routine daunting and stressful there are definitely times where i think my family and i could benefit from more routine but then i remember the feeling of failure when i dont complete a task on time and having my time stretched between three children under four years old not completing tasks on time happens a lot being a nature lover with a more free range parenting style helps keep the stress levels down too so for us its one day at a time and we take it as it comes i acknowledge that we all strive in different environments and to that i say whatever works for you and makes you happy my top four things to do to boost positivity 1 get out of the house if its nice enough weather go for a walk if its not go for a drive this is what i do with the kids and it always makes me feel like ive done something productive with my day plus its like a little adventure for the kids each time 2 make something really healthy to eatdrink ive never been much of a comfort eater instead if im feeling crap i like to have something really healthy to eatdrink i suppose in a way i do it in spite of my feeling crap always feeling at least a little bit better afterwards for doing something good for my body as a parent im trying to do this all the time with my kids but as we know they can be fussy little buggers and id be lying if i said i never felt discouraged when they choose not to eat something i tried so hard to make for them this happens often something that does work more often than not though is smoothiesjuices we use a nutrininja which does a good job at making these for us 3 visual inspiration i find having something to look at often helps it needs to be specific though it cant be one of those signs that tells you to laugh often i find these type of quotes only amplify my negative emotions by reminding me of what im not doing enough of without providing a solution 4 freshen uppamper yourself have a shower shave pluck those eyebrows do a face mask take a minute from chasing after the kids for yourself just like eating healthy makes us feel good about our insides grooming ourselves often makes us feel good about our outsides x200b if you have any questions or stories to share id love to hear from you x200b let me tell you something you already know the world aint all sunshine and rainbows its a very mean and nasty place and i dont care how tough you are it will beat you to your knees and keep you there permanently if you let it you me or nobody is gonna hit as hard as life but it aint about how hard you hit its about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward how much you can take and keep moving forward thats how winning is done now if you know what youre worth then go out and get what youre worth but you gotta be willing to take the hits and not pointing fingers saying you aint where you wanna be because of him or her or anybody cowards do that and that aint you youre better than that sylvester stallone rocky balboa aka my hero,pre-pandemic,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

my ex still friendmore than friends basically together minus the label at least until she leaves for the rest of the summer in july and then off to college so shes basically gone after this next week and a half or so but still here we are having fun and running around i just want her so badly and shes the one and ive had this thing inside of me screaming to go and get her since the second i saw her which was a solid year before we actually spoke and exploded into this true love that we both feel she just wants to go and she has this pain inside of her that is caused by something that may as well not even be of this world shes got this connection to something otherwordly and divine that i cannot see and neither can she but she can feel it i can acknowledge it and feel it somewhat through her but not on my own shes got wings and all ive got are legs and shes flying away and i cant do anything and how am i supposed to go find someone else ive seen and experienced a person whos fucking divine and has wings so how can i settle for legs and how can i find another of the rare winged people or whatever they are and give myself to them the way i have to her when i know theyll just fly away later too thats the thing about winged people they have to fly and i dont have wings so they have no choice but to fly away from me im not depressed about not having wings thats okay with me im special in my own way and all after all i attract people with wings im fucking reeling because shes flying away and i cant do anything and she still is so sweet and tells me she loves me and holds me tightly against her and says for all she knows shell be back someday and i cant handle that time inbetween now and someday even though no matter what happens when that someday comes ill drop whatever i have going on to go back to her i tried to open myself to other people i really did when i was away at school i met another girl who i did have love for as a person not in love love and was beautiful and fun and i genuinely enjoyed her company but my winged beauty still danced around my head and heart and screamed louder and louder im scared of not being able to be with someone else completely without going to sleep and dreaming of her like i still always do i need that kind of person who will be in a relationship with me and grow with me but i want and need it to be her too but shes not going to do it now so i dont know what to do because i cant give myself up to another person completely and thats unfair to everyone her leaving and not wanting to be with me she still loves me and wants me in her life but she cant be in a relationship right now is the point she has to be alone and grow alone and in her words perhaps discover she has to be alone forever and live in the mojave desert in isolation but thats a crock of shit its not just a break up please dont patronize me all the promises of forever she made are still in my head and playing and i still see them in her to some degree and she still feels them i think that if she would allow herself to give into her most truly selfish desires shed ask me to wait for her while she was gone in fact she has asked that before part of me wants to but then again theres that part of me that just needs a relationship thats sweet and stable and present and actually physically there not just fleeting promises of that however many years from now and i dont define myself based off of relationships so i dont need the whole take time to yourself thing i cant even possibly begin to do the story of us and me and this and everything justice in my emotionally frenzied state on some subreddit im just trying for something anything because i feel like im dying and ive been crying for a long time im sick of wasting every wish on her staying with me part of me feels like i need her to just be cut out of my life so i can really move on but thats so horribly painful and were best friends i cant do that to her or myself i just want her i just do my love for her and us forever is the truest thing i have ever felt in all my life more so than 224 but i dont want to feel this way i want someone who will hold me one day and not fly away the next im just so lost and dont know what to do i dont know what i want anyone to say i dont know if any of this makes sense im sure it sounds crazy we really had such good times and we still do just yesterday when i saw her last was so sweet and lovely and simple and fun and just at ease i was at peace she brings me peace and gives me strength and courage but she also takes it all away without meaning to just as quickly i dont know what to make of that story of my life with her why why why why why because what else can you say when nothing makes sense,pre-pandemic,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0

start reading books not a lot of them but the good ones dont pay attention to what people are currently consuming as books read the big ones become friends with books instead of people people you see everyday make you depressive because they are unhappy themselves do not read interpretations or summaries or wikipedia read them directly from the source start reading philosophy nietzsche kierkegaard schopenhauer marx psychology itself freud jung good literature classics dostoevsky kafka camus and history actually nietzschedostoevskyfreud is a very good combination these will introduce you to the awful and depressive reality of life and the viciousness of the people at which point you will stop worrying about yourself see that world is in deep shit and really start thinking about the future of the humanity and therefore yourself actually your body itself is craving for this and you do not know it yet remember it is not about exercising good food or going out and having some friends these are good but are auxiliary depression is all about the conflict between the external reality and the internal picture of it your internal picture is skewed you tendpreferwant to think that life is not cruel at all the reality however is starkly different than that life is cruel people chop each others head off without even thinking even more so in america you know this however at a subconscious level you subconsciously know that people are not like you good and childlike however you dont want to believe that yes it is not easy to accept i couldnt do it myself for over 4 years you have to reach to a new intellectual integrity and comprehendgrasp the external reality as it is if you cannot do it by reading books travel to a country where you can experience a different culture the point is to getting yourself out of the boundaries of capitalism stay there long enough to learn their language see how other kinds of worlds are possible see how people live in poverty and scarcity however how they are friendly happy and carefree remember you are from the western hemisphere and you guys are welcomed everywhere depressionanxiety is not a disease it is an invisible injury the societytimes you are living in is making you depressed you dont want to take it anymore because it looks like it is utterly meaningless to you it ceased to offer you anything however you have to fight you have to fight to change the society to something you want to live in you have to give society a new meaning and this is what the history is all about the history is the story of dissatisfiedcrushed people fighting to obtain their freedoms again,pre-pandemic,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

ok im not sure if this will be a long post but here goes im not really sure if im depressedsuicidal but i really dont like my life right now i certainly shouldnt be complaining im a smart 17 year old who so my teachers tell me will be doing great things with my life i have a complete family and we live decently but i just am so upset all the time i dont know what i have done probably because im slightly overweight but no matter how hard i try i dont feel like i have any true friends people in school see me as a happy outgoing always nice and happy kid but no one understands how sad i am all the time i dont know what it is but i cant find too many good things in my life all of my friends who im there for 247 have helped through some shitty points in their lives are never there for me and forget me like im some fucking garbage im pretty sure my best friend is only my friend to get me to help him with math stuff as he gets all buddy buddy when a test comes around or he needs help with something then kinda drifts away my best girl friend whom im madly in love with only wants to be with my best friend and with all that ive helped her she refuses to understand my feelings despite calling me amazingly nice smart funny caring and one of the greatest guys i know but seeing me as a great friend nothing more i have many other friends who i have done alot for but yet refuse to acknowledge with a thank you or inviting me to hang out giving me the wonderful opportunity of sitting on my ass on reddit on friday and saturday nights sorry for the typical teenage high school drama bullshit but it kinda plays into my main reason for writing this i have thought about suicide but i am too scared of death i feel like i have nowhere to turn i feel like no one cares about me and while everyone around me enjoys their lives i sit at home with no invites or anything i feel like no one gives a fuck about me thats what scares me most i wouldnt consider myself religious i attend church if i can however i have begun to have doubts as to how awful i feel sometimes i am too afraid of dying and the unknown that follows after that to kill myself because it is just too scary what also scares me is wondering who actually truely cares about me i have some anxiety so i am constantly worried about how people feelthink about me but whenever i get to a seriously upset point i begin to think about who would be at my funeral and that scares me because i dont know im starting to cry as i write this because it truely scares the shit out of me i have so many friends as they say but i am constantly belittled by them and even though they say their kidding i know deep down their not i want them to understand how much they have hurt me but im afraid that they wont ive noticed that people get forgotten after a while once they die and i dont want that to happen to me if i were to die i want someone there to think about me and to still acknowledge my existence i question whether or not that someone would feel that way about me im sure at least i hope people would be upset but who would actually care and come to my funeral i want people to show their love and caring for me thats what i really truely want cause right now i feel like im all alone and if i die people would forget me and my whole fucking existence would be for nothing is this considered depressionsuicidal i am just hoping that i dont ever get to the point that i could care less about my life and just want to die i see the beauty and happiness in the world and i love it i just want someone to see that in me,pre-pandemic,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1

so basically my school is crap teachers dont care about me being left out or bullied half of my time here i didnt think the students did until today there was an odd number of girls today since one was off and we had to go into pairs of course none wanted to go with me and neither did any one of the boys so i sat at the side and said i was fine not doing it however one of the boys asked why i couldnt go in a three with one of the girls pairs if you couldnt tell im female and in my school girls and boys dont like to go together much but all of them said no this is a paired activity so he actually got really mad and called them all assholes and said how he noticed how they all treat me like shit and asked if i wanted to go in his pair he got a detention just at lunch break for swearing in front of the teacher and multiple small children passing by but it honestly warmed my heart so much and it showed me that maybe there is some good left in humanity and that someone actually cares it was the first time id felt happy in a long time to be honest,pre-pandemic,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1

if i had to sum up my experience thus far in life now 20 it would boil down to two words invisible and expendable i am a realist when people dont talk to me no big deal right they dont want to offend or something about the southern politeness just beckons them to refrain from engaging in conversation fine when people stare at me with a look of disgust or actively avoid being near me i know i am unattractive not the type of unattractive of being unkempt not the type where a simple shower and clothes would fix their disposition i am the type of ugly repulsiveness that has deep structural flaws in ways that despite my best and honest efforts i cannot fix i know that 99999 of the world does not give even a thought to me not even in the echo of a dream but for the 0001 that i have had the pleasure to come face to face with i am systematically and deliberately avoided and demonized as a creep my ugliness is unique but some of the sentiments that i feel are not to be a man especially a white man in my generation is to be guilty of any and all crimes that even the the most deceptive and notroious of others can bestow upon me and like rabid dogs the media will twist and push until i couldnt even donate ice cream to a childrens hospital without being labeled a creep or pedophile or racist or sexist or any other trendy label that the brigade employs to vilify young white men the ironic part of all this is that my generation of men have done nothing terribly wrong we havent waged wars weve not formed lynch mobs weve never destroyed foundations of civilization in the name of equality and social justice ive just barely made it out of high school where i was told that not only was i competing against the entire world for a chance to work a decent job but that i would be actively discriminated against in preference for others of lesser qualifications in the name of diversity and a more personable candidate in this day in age you either have to be exceptionally beautiful or a politically protected minority that whines loud enough get anybody on your side i am neither im sure some people think that i am being a little whiny bastard and that if i work hard and keep with it ill succeed my father says this a lot but his beliefs of my reality are warped by his age and incomprehension that people are genuinely put off by me i have no champion in my political system anymore we are either converts and cannon fodder for the right or bank accounts and scapegoats for the left i would like it most to be left alone without the government around to tell me who i can or cannot marry what i can or cannot put into my body and how i can and cannot defend myself i would also like a government that does things to help the people that need it because the poor are sick and hungry without decent work and a mass of discontent young men has never led to a stable prosperous society women bash men constantly calling us asshole for just existing that we are the scum of the earth because something people at least half a century ago who happened to have the same colored genitals as me did to women who are not them they are allowed to strike men with impunity in the courts and are almost guaranteed to keep a child regardless if they are even able to feed themselves just let the babies father pay for it the court will say while at the same time not allowing the man to see the fruit of his labor people have become entranced by the fairytales that mass entertainment sells them they are perfect and must have the perfect everything or else their life isnt worth anything i too am under this spell but when a sheep think its a wolf it doesnt say it to the other sheep lest itll be left for the wolves to slaughter there are worse things than this fairytale i tell myself each day i wake up at around 6 or 7 when i wake up the first thing i see is myself each day my head is filled with selfhate from sunrise to shut eyes not hate that helpful either i cannot channel that hate into motivation as there is nothing to change im boned any way with a deck stacked so high against me that im climbing everest every morning in my boxers theres no bright future and no path of escape except the obvious but instead im in a thick grey mist headed deep into a maelstrom that might collapse upon me at any instant and apparently i have privilege that i need to check im not a murderer i dont even have the will to kill myself yet but when people wonder why there are so many mass shootings in my country committed by young white men they are so quick to condemn the man or the weapon or talk about how we all need treatment that they never want to look at the realities that we face we are deemed obsolete by everybody protected by no one and told to hate ourselves for choices that are not ours to make we are nothing more than pawns until weve cornered the king,pre-pandemic,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1

i would give anything to have been born female i hate being male so much men are worth less than nothing in our society every day i wake up look down at my body and feel nothing but disgust i dont want facial hair or body hair or this huge disgusting ogre skeleton every time i shave it feels a little better but its only temporary and the hair starts coming back within a few hours theres no escape from this neverending battle against my own body i used to be sort of okay when i was younger but things are getting gradually worse feminism started appearing in the media all the time a few years ago and it fills me with hatred and rage i feel like a disgusting creep every time im in public ive never had a friend since high school and i know people think im a loser women cross the street to get away from me because im so physically intimidating and i can just tell that they think im staring at them when im on the bus i try to crane my neck to look only out the window but i can just tell they think im a creep sometimes i get so angry i just want to break things and cut myself just recently i read an article in time magazine about toxic masculinity and i cracked my tooth because i was grinding my jaw so hard with anger i hate that feminists think im privileged for this existence the only thing that makes me a little happier is to troll them online and to disprove their antimale garbage with statistics but again i always end up hating myself i cant read the news or go on any website anymore without seeing fucking feminists ranting about how they want to kill all men and now im going bald my hairline is receding rapidly in the corners and any remnant of femininity that i had is disappearing im 24 now and in just 15 years ill be a bald middle aged man and probably fat too worse than garbage i really hope i die before then,pre-pandemic,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1

first i killed the athlete there wasnt much of him to begin with so it was easy at the least he tried to give an effort to materialize during my college days he even joined some after school group of friends to play with that didnt really go anywhere next i killed the gamer he was easy to kill too because of the need the corporate life taking much of my time didnt leave enough breathing room for him to keep up a fight his antics still surface every now and then making me wish for adventures and the blood pumping suspense or action of his previous endeavors i just stuffed his mouth with career dreams he didnt really struggle as he believed that to asphyxiate was actually reasonable next i killed the party boy this one took a little bit more orchestration than the previous two i had to kill his connections with his friends i had to starve him of his former social saturation and in a way that he wont easily recourse back i made his friends believe he didnt need the contact that he was happy the party boy slowly lost his spirit thats when i went for the jugular to end his pain next i killed the musician i almost didnt like killing him hes the most recent one and the most difficult one to get rid of he has support your see all the feelings and emotions closing through him everytime he hears plays or sings a song gives him enough strength to push back hes even made a solid group of friends that push and pull him to their graces but an opening came in the guise of leaving the country that tiny waver in his resolve let me sneak in a stab it was easy enough from then on im just afraid that eventually i might kill the writer too and when i do i dont really know whats left im actually surprised to realize that ive been hurting myself without physically doing so ive lost more of myself in the past few months than i ever had in years and im not making any more of me than what i already have ps i wrote this to myself at a bad time about a year ago and putting what ive been doing in words has surprisingly help me curb and slowly regain myself throughout the past year i still get spans of time where i feel like nothing where i feel afraid of being nothing that id rather just lose my life but remember all youve been through things may not feel the best now but you are not worthless you matter theres a value to everything youve done and accomplished so lets all hold on and hold tight edit thank you so much for giving my first gold kind stranger and to everybody whos commenting i wish i had more time to reply to all of you im surprised with the turnout and even more with how people feel the same and areis going through losing parts of themselves lets all keep holding on to those and try our best not to lose more than we do and for those who feel empty its never too late to find yourself lets all fight for it even if it starts with just getting up from your bed in the morning,pre-pandemic,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

in my hardest moments of depression the thought monster convinces me that im worthless but that other people still have worth i also happen to be convinced that people are either lucky or unlucky and that theres really nothing we have any real control over because of this i can even see the people who do the most atrocious things as forgivable but with myself nothing is good enough every decision i make seems to be not good enough not worth enough to justify ongoing existence are there any things you do that work to remind yourself that thoughts do not necessarily equal truth,pre-pandemic,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1

update so i thought it would only be fair to post this update while one friend still doesnt seem to give a fuck im meeting another friend for lunch tomorrow turns out shes been having a thyroid flare up one other friend also wants to make lunch plans soon so well see about that some people care but have stuff going on other people dont care pay more attention to the former original post seriously fuck everyone its so easy to say after someone ends their life that they should have reached out to a friend and talked but whos really willing to listen only a select few of us are blessed with friends who listen with sympathy and respond in a timely way the rest of them are just faffers capitalism has rotten human relationships to the core and everything has become disposable including friendships hang on with dear life to those who really care about you and are willing to talk more often than not its people who have struggled with mental illness themselves edit it is usually better to talk to a therapist if you can afford therapy that is about issues that friends do not have the professional training to deal with i dont recommend burdening other people with all your issues because that would just drive them away people have enough shit in their own lives to deal with however it sucks if you want to talk with a friend who clearly knows youre going through a tough time and they dont return your call edit 2 looking back at my post i realise i sound a little angry and cynical but i really wish for a culture where mentally ill people could get the nurturing and support they need a big part of that is also having access to mental health professionals who are capable and helpful if you can please seek the help of a therapist it has helped me realize where my boundaries with others lie and how i can strengthen my own self to ask of others what i needdeserve from them it can be a longdrawn process and you might not always land a good therapist at the first attempt but please persevere if you have the means thanks to everyone for your comments im trying to reply to each one but its hard to keep up so im sorry if i miss yours rememberyoure worth the effort and the struggle so please hang in there edit 3 if youre in the us uk canada or aus you can use this directory to find a therapist near you read about them what insurance they take etc,pre-pandemic,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

first off what a stupid fucking question to ask anyway what do you want to hear as the interviewer when you ask that question that im indifferent and stagnant enough to stay with your company that long assuming you hire me or that im ambitiously arrogant enough to in five years plan on being well passed this shit fuckin hell man undoubtedly there are varying degrees of suicidality just as there are reasons for doing it all depends on the person i suppose im the sloth suicidal ive tiptoed through and around depression for the better part of my conscious life and i cant help but feel miserable an overwhelming percentage of the time yet when the obvious solution to this conundrum of despising being alive is well dont be alive anymore the meddling safeguards of thinking about the wake of my actions swelling over everything and everyone i leave behind effectively whiteout any sort of blueprint i have for seeing myself out of my life sounds rather counterintuitive but id rather my last thoughts be more you gave it a go youre not doing anything wrong you do you kiddo and less hey youre a tremendous asshole for this i hope you know that i can comfortably say im not doing it tonight or tomorrow or this year or even the next but i genuinely feel like thats how im going out pending the absence of a freak car crash or lightning strike or some shit dont even really know what im trying to say here but do you ever feel like this like life is essentially an existential clusterfuck that you want no part of but for whatever fucking reason just cant make any sort of move afterthought cant help but laugh that when driveling on in this post i look up at the browser tab and it says submit to depression haha fuckin a,pre-pandemic,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,1

well ill start off with that i work a job that keeps me away from home almost all year i love my job but i hate that i am not ever home for the last 6 months i have started to feel completely stuck and without any options at all to fix my current situation of being gone all the time also whenever im gone i get texts and messages from friends and family all having get togethers and saying oh you should be here cant wait until youre home so we can hang out but when im home nobody seems to have any time to do anything and i end up just spending that time at my house with my wife about 6 months ago these actions have started making me paranoid that nobody really wants to see me around and they cant wait until i leave to start doing fun things again my wife who i love very much has recently been acting in this same way and any time i try to call her just to talk she seems to be too busy and always about to go do whether that be go hang out with friends hang out with family go to an amusement park go to a movie i always seem to have poor timing and she seems to never want to talk to me when i express my displeasure with being gone all the time and tell her i want to quit and find a job that i can be at home she shuts me down and tells me that that is not an option ive been gone from home for 3 months straight now and that entire time my mind continually thinks up things on its own for no reason like having thoughts of my wife cheating on me thoughts that she doesnt even want me around thoughts that my friends really dont like me and dont want me around even though i know these things are not true my mind thinks them up anyway and i either get uncontrollably angry or bawl my eyes out for no reason these feelings drive me deeper and deeper into despair and im to the point now where i dont feel like i can talk to anyone about it so when im on the phone with anyone or texting with them i try and act like nothing is wrong i have lately started thinking about never going home again because of thinking that no one cares about having me around and while i dont quite yet feel like life isnt worth living i feel like suicidal thoughts are not too far into the future with this road im going down i really feel like i need help but i dont have an opportunity to do so at the moment im terrified of where i might be heading but see no way to stop it everyday is a horribly bad day and i feel like it will never get better,pre-pandemic,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1

antidepressants efficacy is in practice close to placebo and yet some few get subjective benefits but also some get devastating permanent damages the majority eats an unhealthy substance thinking they need it but all it does is nothing or side effects for instance on ssris and snris its assumed and studied that around 70 of users get some level of sexual dysfunction during use and for some these get severe and permanent this includes often total emotional numbness and loss of pleasure there are studies showing better efficacy than placebo too but even european medicine agency representative agreed in a tv intrerview that the typical number to treat for antidepressants is around ten 110 gets clear benefit no other medication will be allowed with such efficacy rate yet massive list of risks,pre-pandemic,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

this is very long but i am so depressed prior to surgery i considered myself to be pretty and even strangers would compliment me on my beauty i am an extremely vain person and whenever something went wrong in my life i would always think at least im still pretty before surgery i would spend hours just looking at myself in the mirror and was obsessed with my appearance i had rhinoplasty to remove a small dorsal hump on the side of my nose i told the surgeon i liked the rest of my nose and did not want it to change from the front profile he recommended a small chin implant to better balance my facial asthetics with the new nose i agreed to it stupidly even though i dont even have a receded chin i think he was trying to get more money from me i also asked him will this change my face from the front to which he replied no only the side it has been 3 months since the surgery and i am honestly suicidal everyone has told me or hinted that i look worse from before and i literally cant even look in the mirror at all i never go outside and i am even taking a semester of school because i feel deformed the surgeon ruined my face and ruined my beauty i feel heartbroken and distraught i will never get my looks back i didnt even have a large nose but the surgeon rotated the tip up and made it even smaller it looks awful especially when i smile and changed my whole face for the worst people keep thinking im in high school now the small upturned nose gave me a childish cutesy appearance that has ruined my entire face before i looked older and would get hit on multiple times when id go outside even just to the supermarket now im lucky if it happens once every few days the chin implant looks seriously fucked up and lengthened my chin so much from the front it looks horrible it also changed my smile completely and made my face look wider i just found out that the material the surgeon used moulds into your own bone and nerves so it is very difficult to remove and odds are that i will never get my old chin and smile back this was the most devastating thing to hear other surgeons tell me i will never have my old nose back i seriously have never been depressed or suicidal in my life but now all i think about is killing myself it is the only solution i can think of since i cant live my life with this ugly face i cant go outside and when i do i literally feel like a monster i feel like this would be easier to handle if i was slightly less attractive than before surgery but seriously i went from feeling beautiful and feeling pretty to feeling like a hideous monster i know its not all in my head since multiple people have told me i look worse than before and i can see the dramatic difference in pictures my days are spent researching revision surgeons who can hopefully restore my old face and constantly crying over my lost beauty now i will have to pay 20000 for a revision to have a rockhard nose made up of rib cartilage and fake pieces which will never look as good as my original nose i feel like god is punishing me for my selfabsorption vanity and pursuit of perfection i really dont know what i did to deserve this i wouldnt wish this on my worst enemy i seriously seriously will kill myself if the revision surgery cant give me close to my old face back my life has literally been ruined i never thought cosmetic surgery which i paid thousands of dollars for would make me ugly i loved my face from the front profile before and now i wake up every morning petrified to look in the mirror not only is my beauty gone but so is my sense of identity i no longer recognize my own face in the mirror and everything i loved about it is gone i have to live with this mistake for the rest of my life which i honestly cant handle i feeling overwhelming saddness and regret every time i pass by a mirror i cant even use the bathroom without breaking down into tears when i catch a glimpse of my fucked up face in the mirror i have never felt so hopeless in my entire life what makes things worse is that family and friends tell me youre ruining everyone elses lives you look fine when i cry and constantly complain about my nose but i dont feel fine i feel hideous and my parents say its hard to have sympathy because i did this to myself i hate them for saying this i already blame my stupidity naivety and vanity i already blame myself enough i dont need them telling me this is my fault as well its not like i wanted the surgeon to ruin my face i just wanted a small bump gone off the side of my nose and now my entire face has been destroyed only those who have experienced something similar can truly understand how it feels to look in the mirror and no longer recognize your face but instead see a ugly monster staring back at you sorry this is so long but i have nothing else to do except sit on my laptop all day since this surgery happened i never even knew what reddit was until a month ago to anyone considering any cosmetic surgery dont do it unless you absolutely hate your current nose or looks i wouldnt wish this pain on anyone i know that i will kill myself if i cant get similar to my previous looks back i really really see no other option since i cant live with this face i have now,pre-pandemic,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
ive been with my girlfriend for 4 years she knows about my depression and has tried to help me through it a few months ago i was on the verge of killing myself i couldnt bear living my life the way it was anymore instead i cheated i had an affair i felt overwhelming guilt but i felt less depressed it made me feel alive it lasted 3 months until i couldnt handle the guilt anymore and i broke it off since then ive been trying my best to treat my girlfriend the way she deserves but im as depressed as ever and now the girl i had the affair with wants to start up again i want to say no but i dont see a point in living if i do i dont think i would survive without my girlfriend either if i thought it would cause her less pain if i killed myself then i would but i think it would make it worse for her especially if the affair came to light has anyone else been in a similar situation cheating as a means of escape,pre-pandemic,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1

using a throwaway account ive asked myself this question so many times but i still dont know posting here because i think it would violate radvice i am struggling with mental health issues and one of the things i need to figure out is if something was a rape or not feel free to remove this post if it violates the rules we were at the same age 7 i had known the boy since forever we grew up as neighbors we were best friends im a girl btw i dont remember the order of things what i know is that he asked to see mine several times but i always said no he did push me to have sex with him i couldnt say no i tried but i didnt even know what was going on we were standing we didnt do it fully i went over to his place one time and he wanted to have sex of course i said no and said we could make out instead i remember i couldnt breath seriously we were just kids kids dont know how to kissanother time i remember us being in his room under some blankets while his mother was in the house i dont remember what we did after a while i wanted to do it with him but didnt know how to say it to him i was scared others knew and lost contact with him i dont remember for how long it happened but i recall us sitting in my closet he said that it was one year since i promised him that he could see mine thats all i remember i think he pushed me for a year or somethig before we started doing it i dont know really i do know that i became attached to him and hated it when the offer was of the table were we just kids fooling around or was it a rape can it be a factor to why im struggling to this day i just know that it happened and i remember very little of it in one way after a while i wanted it but i clearly did not want it in the first place as mentioned feel free to remove this i just hope someone here have any advice or new perspective edit one more thing i was visiting a family friend a girl who was my age well turned out she was kinda crazy we decided to set up a tent on the lawn this was on the countryside the grown ups were in house 100 metres away she said she used narcotics which of course wasnt true we were 910 she did have some pills though she said she couldnt sleep and other stuff we laid quietly in our own sleeping bag when she started talking inher sleep she might have been awake and faking it but all i know is that she was talking she tried to touch me and kiss i was freaked out and tried to keep her off me she was strong after an indefinite amount of time she stopped and we slept the day after she tried to watch porn with me she turned on the computer and entered some porn site i left same day we were at a stony beach we created a little shelter from the wind and she tried to kiss me i think she did i dont remember it so clearly do think we kissed i have no idea whats up with this weird stuff i dont feel like it affected me but as i write this i realize some of it is kinda fucked up,pre-pandemic,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

okay so maybe it is more complicated than that yet no one has control over our inner feelings and thoughts except ourselves doctors do a great disservice by prescribing drugs which often have devastating side affects that enhance negative emotions rather than cure them breathing establishing a mindful meditation practice and realizing you are not alone can go much farther towards overcoming the paralysis of depression than any drug can when my mom was dying i asked her how she felt i knew how much she loved life and she did whatever she could to extend her life as she suffered cancer in her final years she replied with a smile what am i going to do get depressed about it thats a waste of my time much of our attachment to negative feelings are learned behavior when we start retraining our minds and realize what extraordinary luck we have to even be born we can begin to blossom and lead the extraordinary lives that all of us have the potential to lead death comes quick enough why rush it with heavy self absorbed thoughts when i am happy i rejoice because i have the awareness to experience it when i am in pain i also rejoice that i have the awareness to experience it for pain is a basic human condition that proves we are all connected take heart and be aware,pre-pandemic,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0

why are we women treated like this regardless of whether or not you are a democrat or a republican shouldnt people not just women get justice ive been obsessing over the whole kavanaugh issue i cant seem to get anything donethere are so many people in power or arent who are blatantly guilty and yet are not dished a punishment instead they are met with sympathy and are given free passes boys will be boys victims are treated like inconveniences and are blamed for being in situations assaults they never wanted to be in if you say youre a feminist and want equal rights between men and women you get called crazy and irrational if a man sides with womens rights movements they get made fun of why is that what is so wrong in being a feminist im talking a real feminism wanting everyone to be treated with equal dignity respect and offered the same opportunities when women get emotional and passionate they get called crazy and irrational when women keep their cool and act assertive they are called cunts or cold bitches but when men show such displays they are often perceived as credibly justified to behave the way they did they even get treated as if theyre victims of unjust blame when they are to be faced with the consequences of their actions imagine mrsford acted like kavanaugh and vise versa oh how the world would turn upside down all these issues are taking an emotional and mental toll on me and yet i cant stop following the news on this case i feel trapped in a reality that doesnt make any sense i feel as if i dont belong in anywhere because i can never feel safe how can i feel safe if we let people like kavanaugh get away with this shit let alone get nominated to be a sj how can i feel like i have a shred of control when the strongest person in the us the fuckin president is a predator himself i know people are gonna say innocent until proven guilty but also remember that we arent dumbasses we can see through the bullshit i started having more and more intrusive thoughts and flashbacks of my assaults i still thought about it every day even before the k hearing started since i still have physical damage from the assault but i was able to push through my day without the memories bringing me extreme emotional pain and irrational fear i was able to get shit done now my body jitters and i get muscle spasms and have a hard time calming down my heart rate i get nightmares and vivid dreams about the assault i keep thinking about how i too was treated like shit when i reported my second sexual assault i didnt report the first one because i was too scared of how i would be treated but then it kept bugging me and at the time hated myself for being so scared i was trapped and he violated me via penetration fingers i still remember how i was alone with him cornering me and i still remember how his breath stank from smoking cigarettes i remember how i pushed away and ran out i remember the song playing in the radio as i drove home while crying what i dont remember what the exact fuckin date was but it doesnt mean it didnt happen thats a fuck you to lindsey graham when i mentioned that i didnt report it 1st assault on a thread here on reddit several people told me that im just as guilty as my assailant because by not reporting his actions he will hurt other people and i am too selfish to do anything about it that made me even more miserable because at the time i believed them because i hated myself and was feeling damaged and disgusted with myself as if i was the rapist my second sexual assault was when i was at my dormitory and the person who assaulted me was also living on the same floor the person was generally liked by the people on our floor and so was i at least at the beginningthat person even before the assault was working their way into ruining my reputation spreading rumours about me on a couple of occasions other people on my floor saw the person being physically forceful with me and didnt do anything in fact they helped the asshole they blocked my way when i tried getting away the person literally dragged me and confined me in my dorm room and blocked the door they forced me to take off my clothes and oh how kind hearted they were had me change into sleep clothes right in front of them when i wanted to go to the bathroom the asshole forced themself into the stall and wont leave a couple of times i managed to run away from them and they literally chased me down and dragged me back to the room it was humiliating those couple nights two worst incidents by them they forced me to sleep in their bed and i remember crying as they felt me up they spread rumors about me and i was already going through my own kind of hell extreme family and financial issues i tried to commit suicide and i was forcefully detained to be completely honest the worst of my injuries were from my altercations while being detained so i wont say its assault the cops and staff involved were just doing their job but their actions mainly the hospital shit definitely made me and still makes me feel deeply violated it was my fault i was having a mental breakdown and while i didnt try hurting them i definitely put all i have in trying to runget away at the er i was held down by several male security guards as they strapped me down to the bed which gave me flashbacks and made me panic even more some patients were watching as i was strapped down and kept watching as a nurse came in to sedate me that ment they watched as i was manhandled and pinned by the guards had my pants and panties pulled down to get injected with antipsychotics of course everyone in my dormitory found out because that shit head predator stalked me and told everyone i came back to an atmosphere wherein some people acted as if i was invisible i pressed charges on that shit bag and people found out i had to give detailed descriptions of the assault to a male detective which was super uncomfortable people refused to support me by telling the detective they saw nothing but many of them saw me being dragged so forcefully that i had bruises the next day most stopped talking to me including friends a few called me disgusting others shook their heads in a condescending way when they saw me trying to explain myself as if its my fault as if i owed anyone anything with addition to all that a close family member passed away a couple weeks later i was given zero emotional support instead i was told to keep my grievance on low volume that stress caused me another mental breakdown in which i slit my wrists cops came i was put in a mental hospital for a couple of days but it only made me feel more exposed and violated i was forced to strip down in front of a female staff member she saw me completely naked as she inspected me then one of the lead staff who checked me in started being creepy with me asking a lot of unnecessarily sexual questions especially about my sexual assaults which seemed to make him pleased i dont even know how to describe it he asked me if i was dating anyone and kept calling me beautiful he was super touchy and told me about how good he is at making love it made me feel unsafe i felt extremely worthlessness he was enjoying and feeding off my pain i felt like a slab of meat and that i dont deserve any help when i came back from the mental ward and was still grieving and processing the never ending humiliation i was told that i should get over it not talk about it or leave the dormitory and live in a different hall so i shut my mouth and didnt say anything and there i was with no friends and feeling violated this week i was called by the detective and he told me no charges will be filed since it was a he said she said situation and did i mention how i needed to describe in extreme details my sexual assault well i did but still they got away with it and i was left exposed and deeply traumatized anyways for people who support people like brett and dismiss people like ford blindly just remember that coming forward about sexual assault isnt easy its invasive humiliating and scary even if you comply you get blamed for the actions of the predator as if you had control knowing if you report abuse right away which is completely up to the victim its possible to not be believed just remember that im one of many people by people i am including women men and children etc that suffered from the sexual abuse but also suffered from the the general lack of empathy and dignity from those we report it to you might know someone who was a victim of sexual abuse without even knowing it cheers,pre-pandemic,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1

first of all id like to apologize about bugging people on this matter i know i should go to the doc but i see them on here all the time and docs cost money in the real world my application for benefits is being processed with the va now so ill probably end up going within the next few weeks im 23yo this has been an ongoing issue ive had since ive been back from iraq army veteran after about 2 months from getting back in the states i went back to my 95 job in it and began to selfmedicate with pot i stayed stoned as hell everyday which did wonders for me no more anxiety thoughts unclouded i could focus better its like it turns the noise down so i can think straight but nothing lasts forever my pot connection was torn and i went through that depressive withdraw phase the first week which is usually no biggie i havent drank smoked or anything else in the past 3 months and its worse than ever here are my symptoms head pressure scatter brained thoughts are cloudy as hell unable to focus on anything apathetic numb empty lack of motivation anxiety i avoid people as much as possible when i encounter a social unavoidable social situation i think more about what they are possibly thinking and the scattered thoughts around me very hard to focus when conversing with someone i dont know find myself staring off at walls trying to separate the noisy irrelevant thoughts for minutes at a time lack of energy and i run 3 times a week fucking depressed as shit because of the above i am no longer me anymore feel like im on the verge of a nervous breakdown but it never comes im not the sensitive type either guys ive done my research and i think its a combination of adult add and social anxiety i want to think clearly again and get my motivation and life back if it is this what would be the best way of getting the docs approval and trying medication for treatment i just dont want the doc to think im in there for some meds that will get me fucked up but i would like something that actually works just needed your opinion reddit thanks in advance,pre-pandemic,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
every girl is the same they all want one thing only money a guy with the fucking audi or equivalent and a lot of money in his pocket it doesnt matter if you are ugly if you have money she will be with you they all say they care about love and all that but they lie they are all the same only care about money i tought that she was special when i met her but she is probably same as every one else so good luck every rich born has bigger chances of having a girl then normal guys poor ones fuc you all edit i was pissed of well mostly because of the situation im in so i didnt give enough explanation i didnt know was it 3 or 15 oclock at that time somewhere around februaryshe did catch coldnonsense ignore it i never had a girl friend either of those mostly because i was always focused on my carrer so i didnt have enough time to go out or even hang out with friends because i was always shybasically im that guy in class you dont talk to unless you have to and you avoid him just because he maybe doesnt care about looks or anything else he just cares about his objective and when he completes it he instantly moves on another one he cant enjoy like most of the people can because he always thinks that whatever he does thats not sufficent but i mean he cares about his friends and everyone but he will never show it and so he finished high school went to university and thats where shi starts happening he notices that one girl in the class and he thinks about her all the time he can study he finishes some pretty hard exames while 80 rest of the class failes them but he doesnt care only thing he cares about is her why you ask i dont know why do i care so much about someone that i dont even know i jumped to conclusion that she is the same as the others but i dont want to think like that about her because i dont know her but your mind can and will play games with you i know that before i met her i waslike everyone else in their 1819s played a lot of video games a lot over 10 years of video games under my belt ps1 crash bandicot bugs bunny great games ps2 f1 06 vice city san andreas ps3 gta v mw3 especially when on first year of university you know professors iritate you so when you get home you turn on mw3 and you express your anger in multiplayer those were the days but that took some part of me i was never good in social situations talking with other people was impossible i never felt safe wherever i went i just wanted to go back home sit in front of the tv and play maybe thats the reason why i m in a fuced situation now but i know that when i met that person in class weeks were passing by and i never quite understand that i tought that o she looks great i like the way she looks wow she is smart i like that i didnt notice on time signes that im falling in love with someone because i never knew that feeling you know when i recall now beautiful dark brown bob hair on her at least thats what she looked like when i saw her for the first time back in 2012 i remember at first i hated that particular university i hated going there every day every freakin day but later on i went there just to saw here it was strange its strange even now when i think about it about this situation i could never think that something like that could happen to me for me she is the most beautiful girl in whole time and space i know there are others but i just want her no one else most fascinating thing is that there is a possibility that the same chemistry teacher teached me when i was in junior school 12 years before high school for one year and then that teacher moved to different city to different high school and teached her that girl i saw on first year of university the one im talking about in this text in her school 23 years later after it teached me thats incredible unfortunatley she is probably with someone who doesnt deserve her respect her but no matter what i will love her unconditionally because she is something special really is a lot of time passed and i decided to call her but due to my lack of courage and all those things that go with it low self esteem voice inside of my head and general bad opinion about myself i screwed up with that one phone call i mean we never talked we dont know each other but i like her i love her for gods sake why how i dont understand and i dont know my biggest concern is not that she will reject me no my biggest concern is that i ll never be able to tell her that she changed my life the way i do things the way i look on others now i dont play video games anymore and i take care of my self more then ever because of her i always dress best i can wherever i go because subconsciously i think what if i see her somewhere i want to look best i can for her i planed on calling her for the second time to tell her all this to tell her that i ll love her no matter what till the end of my life but im afraid that i ll never be able to do it biggest fear is that i ll woke up someday in a hospital and the doctors will tell me something like easy sir in your ages every movement can be critical and then i ask what ages i m 22 for gods sake then they say no sir you are 80 years old thats my biggest fear that i ll find myself in a situation like that that time will pass by like a train but i will still want to call her and tell her i love her unfortunately it will be too late then but even then i wont be able to do it unfortunatley right need to go back to explain things an a moment of anger i wrote that every girl is the same of course they arent but most of them are i cant buy her expensive gifts diners skiing or something else the only thing i can give her is my life but of course thats not important today so there you have it full story dont make mistakes i did if you like someone if you think you love them give it a go right that moment right that time for me its over i m already 80 years old even thou im just 22 but i already regret for things i missed a lot of people i see around here have problems we all have for someone this could be a walk in the part to do something like this but to me it isnt my entire life people were good to me but then long time ago something went wrong i dont know what or when but i know that when i think about her i smile and sometimes i could even motivate myself to do some things but then voice kicks in and says things like what do you want why would she be with a guy like you you are poor you will die on street and then i sometimes justgo crazy and hate myself i was normal long time agoi dont know if ill ever get better or be able to do something out of my self i live in a soso family they say they love me and all they see i m sad and they ask what is it but i never tell them its not just about that one girl its about many other things in my life but she was that one thing because i wrote this i m sorry younger me i betrayed you you could be someone buti didnt know better i never understood people around me i always tought that my life is a mistake probably is butim sorry if it means something to you i apologise for any grammar mistakes english is not my native i m sorry,pre-pandemic,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1

to give more context i have known this girl for some time to the point id consider her a best friend weve hung out a lot and shes drunkenly made out with two of my best friends on separate occasions im 18 i just graduated from highschool as of june i decided to take a year off to make some money and then go to university next year i invite her ill call her k to a party my friend was having everyone was having a good time but then one of my other friends d was getting very creepy and odd towards k so instead of hanging with the herd i decided to do a decent friend move and get him to back off later into the night shes trying to sleep and d is follwing her around so i get the host c to come get him well thats going on i casually kissed k and then we proceeded to makeout a little and asking if it was okay c comes back with d and tells k about a room she can crash in around this time everything was super hazy shots of everclear were given out it was my first time drinking it and one way or another we were both in the room and in the bed i started to get handsy and i kept asking if it was okay and she said it was i wake up from her leaving the room the next morning saying gotta drive home for work see ya later or something along those lines i dont remember what happened at that very instance as i was still recovering and was still drunk around late noonish i woke up thinking everything was cool i felt really gross by what i did but i assumed everything was groovy as we were both very drunk and the worse thing that would have happen is i fingered her which i asked was okay and she said it was but as i said i was pretty ashamed of myself and didnt think much of it as it was consensual the next day i talked to her but the whole convo seemed off and later into the day i asked what was up she said what happened was a mistake but that it wasnt my fault it was just the situation she said it would be best if we werent friends and i decided to tell her about when i was raped at 15 how i had no control felt helpless even when i said no i told her that i never intended to do that to her and that was the reason i kept asking if it was okay but that i felt awful and that it would honestly never happen again because i loved her as a friend so much and id never want to hurt her she accepted the apology and we made plan to hang on wednesday party was sunday when she came down with another one of my friends things were off again she seemed distant and didnt look me in the eye after that a day or two later she was acting weird i called her and she said after seeing me in person she just couldnt be friends with me we both go emotional mostly me but k insisted it wasnt my fault it was just the situation we agreed to keep our friendship on hold a lot of stuff happened between then and now the gist is we agreed to just be casual friends but then on another drunken night i told my best friend ca about how she felt like punching him and stuff k somehow got told our one bestie who will be kt was texting me about it and she read what i was texting her it was kt told me and her friend sent me a snap of her saying im going to fight you and i broke down in tears on that day i thought keeping my distant was just for the best and decided just not to be friends as the situation escalated because of me again and i just wanted to stop hurting her i was also told by kt that k reacted poorly even when i explained that i was drunk so distance was for the best i asked kt to send a have a good futute please understand the situation and im really sorry kt told me she really didnt respond but was happy i sent her best wishes a couple weeks go by and im feeling a little better something i didnt mention was that as soon as the situation happened i couldnt fall asleep i would cry myself to sleep almost ever night feeling awful and shitty i had lost all motivation to do anything and was in a very sad state but i was getting better in that time period i started seeing a therapist and eventually started taking medication for my depression i decided to block k on most social medias with exception of facebook as i still wanted to make sure she was okay in some light also i thought blocking people was pretty extreme so i decided to keep k on my facebook a week goes by and now we are roughly two days away from today i dont pay much mind to k but notice shes going to this halloween and i was like rad okay maybe ill go to so i said i was going on the page left a witty comment and went about my day an hour or so later i noticed wasnt going anymore i tried searching her name and i was blocked i was a little upset i proceeded to talk kt about this as i have been thw whole time because instead of getting my anger out on k telling her how lame it was because i thought we were cool but that it was whatever one thing leads to another and i was saying that i couldnt even imagine continuing a friendship with k because i felt she juvenile and childish for acting the way she has been especially when it came to our relationship that she persisted it was the situation but would treat me terribly during the entire situation that she never realized how ive been feeling like a bordeline rapist and she didnt say anything to comfort me that i wasnt kt finally told me how k had been feeling you see kt was a buffer for me and kesley we basically would dump our feelings on kt so we wouldnt get mad at each other it worked and if one person said something about the other she would tell the other from what kt told me k was basically blowing this out of proportion i was upset about it because our relationship was done because of one awful night i digress k told kt i sexually assaulted her she has told three of her friends including kt as well i was having a panic attack i thought things were finally done and we could look past the situation and move on either as friends or not but i didnt think things were ever ever this bad k explained to kt even though she was saying okay with it she thought i would take the hint that it wasnt okay immediately i felt like shit i sexually assulted my best friend and have been nothing but bitter about her thinking that the situation was to blame but it was all my fault she felt this way k also said that whenever my name was mentioned or she saw me online she would feel anxious when she was starting to feel better she saw i commented on that halloween page and decided to block me then went straight to kt about it just as i have kt told me she believes her as has known her for much longer then i have and she never had a reason to lie kt also said she believes me because she knows how much i care about people and she knows im a good person and considering what happened to me she knows i would never do the same she knows that i never pressured my girlfriend now ex this would have been when i was 17 of a year into sex that in every other situation at a party or club when im invited to have relations or makeout with a girl i always say no no matter how drunk i am so she doesnt understand why i did what i did i dont either i felt sick to my stomach after hearing all of that all i could do was cry i hurt someone i truly care for and had just completely lost the will to live i decided that i was going to take my life as i cant live knowing i hurt someone i care about so much to the point where if she saw me she felt anxious the next day i had a job interview i was up till 4 crying and feeling like shit i looked it too and was late to the interview but somehow i got the job now were here today i just walked home from work as i dont have a license i have planned everything out i dont want to do it today but at some point this month i have thought about it a lot through all of august it happened at the beginning of that month but i now feel its the only way to set things right but i want help i still want to live but i just cant find a reason to im a monster i honestly just cant handle this i dont have my future planned out and now im an equal to every other rapist you see in the news so many other awful things have happened and when it did despite feeling like my life was meaningless i was still happy i found a reason to be happy knowing i was getting better making more friends and that i was a good person i was a social guy who was a friend to all but now i dont even have that i dont feel like im a good person but i still want to live and i have no one to turn to my therapist is on holiday until the 19th i looked up my situation on the internet and saw a similar post about someone who had a done something similar i know this is super long i apologize for being all other the place but i just cant think straight

the last thing i want to do is get ahead of myself with the possibility of getting depressed over a negative response but i cant hold bad the joy in all of this ive been jobless for 3 months and the money situation has been killing me working with 170 a week from unemployment while viciously looking for another job stacked with a bunch of other things my depression has been plummeting and recently i made a post about hitting rock bottom but if things go through i could look at all of that turning around this morning i received a voice mail from a company i sent a rsum in with and had a long phone call with a very nice lady this job seems to use everything that ive learned from my previous jobs and i nailed the preinterview with style this job pays 430 more per hour than any job ive ever had and its a full time position id finally be able to afford the necessities in life and actually continue on with my head held high i have another phone interview tomorrow morning and she said if i nailed that then i pretty much have the job im so excited,pre-pandemic,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1

to all those who struggle with depression im very new to this illness but it has changed me entirely in the short amount of time it has been a part of my life im happy to say im finally starting to feel better and without any counseling medication anything just some talks with lifelong friends and a lot of looking inward even though the past 7 months of my life has been hell i have still found the tiniest nugget of positivity out of it all this is the cheesiest thing i could say but goddamnit its been proven to be true what doesnt kill you makes you stronger yes youve heard it 10000 times in songs in movies in books and it probably has lost its meaning to you at this point but i have realized that the trials and tribulations i have gone through these past few months have made me different yes but i can honestly say for the better i have done so much thinking obsessive thinking about my depression and this new me that was formed by the hot coals of my afflictions is so much wiser so much stronger than the naive stoner kid i used to be so while i still do have problems most days the one thing that always gets me through it is knowing that no matter what happens i will come out the other end a stronger soul i really hope this helped somebody it feels absolutely amazing getting this all out one love,pre-pandemic,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

i dont know where else to say this since ill most definitely be branded a freak right off that bat by a lot of people but because of this issue i feel i am completely hopeless this is the note i made to post here i hate being a human i would rather be any animal but this but most of all i would be canis lupus familiaris a dog this instinct is strong and i fear i will never live the life i was meant to i may never be happy locked forever in an endless struggle against my humanity i am not human inside i know this for sure my life would be complete if i could run on all fours and find my place in the world as a canine but i fear i will never reach anything near that i feel like giving up and spending all day in my room naked and cold and on all fours always eating only dog food out of a bowl i know it would not be right but i feel it is all i can do this is not the way a creature like me should live its just not its so bad that i i feel like i would rather commit suicide than continue to live having a human voice is the absolute worst feeling in the world nothing against being human but to me it feels like breathing chalk i dont know what to do anymore the dreams i used to have of being small and on all fours are gone and now i feel like i have nothing left im a bitch i should have been part of that litter and now i either have to do something drastic or give up all together edit i should ad that my greatest fear is that my problem is unsolvable and i will continue to live out the exceptionally long life of a human being with little to no consolation or accommodation whatsoever,pre-pandemic,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1
i was quite shocked at their reactions i sorta expected a very stigmatized reaction for some reason the first professor blew up on me in immediate concern for my wellbeing he too had actually been through similar circumstances when he was younger and the second professor he had a close friend who was suicidal and very depressed as well he was very calm throughout the whole conversation actually that was a really fucking cool thing to have a legit chat about mental health with college professors edit i really cant express enough how reassuring all of your supportive comments are i would like everyone to know that i actually just recently started therapy for the first time this semester and it is doing wonders hopefully i get the courage to schedule with the on campus psychiatrist soon to see if medication can help also thank you all for reminding me that people do care about others thank you greatly,pre-pandemic,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

if that doesnt prove that depression is one of the biggest illness to ever plague us then i dont know what will i really hope one day people would emphathise and know how it feels to live this way and how hard it is to open up and how small it feels to beg for a way out only to be ignored or shut down that too by people whom you would give your life for fuck this shit i hope i was born heartless and emotionless so i didnt care about these kind of people but i still love them even after they refused to help me i hope i die a miserable death it would only be fitting to the already cruel game someone is playing with me if i cower and fail to kill myself and live long enough to maybe make something of myself i promise to do everything in my power to eradicate or atleast help the people suffering from this,pre-pandemic,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1

when i was attending high school i was top of my class with a dream of attending an ivy league university particularly mit all my teachers were extremely proud of me my parents were excited for my future in education my peers thought highly of me however once the middle of my junior year came i was faced with an overwhelming mental breakdown and fell into a depression i would spend sleepless nights doing schoolwork with already unstable mental health or i would do completely nothing and think i eventually started to think about why i am doing this and realized that i dont like this traditional route im going on nor will the results of it make me happy as i am already depressed doing the things i should like doing at that moment my life lost its meaning near the end of my junior year into senior i stopped taking care of myself developed insomnia due to my obligation to try and keep up with my ap classes and my thoughts relentlessly wandering and slept in all my classes my teachers parents and peers as a result started looking down at me wondering why i became such a disappointment according to my principal when i wanted to lighten my workload this put me in the deepest depression of my life as i felt i failed everyone and destined to be nothing i would resort to cutting myself drinking taking old prescription pills and withhold from eating as a way to punish myself to make this short i decided to make my main way of attaining happiness is music that is my dream everyone is still disappointed in me and it weighs heavy on me i wish it could go away this was more of a medium to vent instead of ask for help as i am not feeling well at the moment thank you if u actually do read this,pre-pandemic,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0

unfortunately we live in a time where nationality still matters in most places regardless of how open and connected the world is trying to become and depending on which country and environment you were born in it determines a lot of things about early life and social acceptance in the world i was not one of the lucky people that were born in countries such as the united states japan germany or canada and although i am not saying that people always have it better there but the social standards and international opportunities they have are definitely way above some poor and useless countries from eastern europe middle east or central africa where life direction is uncertain and the main motivation is to escape somewhere else i was born in a small and useless country from eastern europe in a wrong environment of uneducated people and never had motivation for anything in life which lead into messing up high school and getting a useless bachelors degree in a subject i didnt care about the only thing that i had interest in was someday going to japan to study or do something else productive there it was only after i finished the useless bachelor that i understood the actual degree that i wanted but due to the past mistakes and life directions and because of the wrong environment and people almost all the doors have been closed now since it is almost impossible to be admitted into a university in japan and also my country is unimportant internationally and noone would take it seriously while people who were born in germany or the us even if they mess up their life and drop out of school they still have many other opportunities and routes to be accepted in japan or in general obtain their degrees and move on but for us one mistake and it is over i feel like i am being punished daily for coming from the wrong place and seeing that most people here are already born in prestigious countries mainly the us makes posts like this even harder because most advices come from americans who have it way better than us in the first place i just want to leave this stupid place and study abroad even if i have to take another undergraduate degree i cant stay here anymore and honestly seeing all the illegal immigrants from the middle east or mexico swarming the important countries makes them completely justified from my viewpoint because its not their fault that they were born in the wrong place,pre-pandemic,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

they originally belonged to my grandpa im not a hunter but we used to go out target shooting and i was a pretty good marksman when he died he left me two of his old rifles theyve mostly sat locked in my closet ever since worth a lot of money but unable to let go of them partly out of sentimentality but id come to realize that i also felt compelled to keep them around for more troubling reasons my depression has been lifelong and ive had varying degrees of success fighting it recently things have been okay but ive had a nightmare of a time with intrusive thoughts impulses to do things i dont even want to do would pop in to my head at the worst times and i would fixate on the details of the aftermath until i would bring myself either to tears or to panic what if i just went up there and did it would my wife be better off in the long run would the friends i havent spoken to in years show up this is shit i do not need running through my mind two years ago i was feeling better i was finally getting serious about art and photography again i actually started selling prints and even had a little space in a local gallery for my work then the grey returned and i started seeing less and less worth going out to see then the darkness came back and i became convinced that those things i used to see and enjoy were gone now and nothing good was on the horizon so last week i made a decision packed up the guns all the ammo i had left and drove to the sporting goods store i got 2200 cash for the pair of guns and on the way home i stopped by best buy and bought myself a fujifilm xt3 for just around 2000 later that evening the intrusive thoughts returned as i tried to think about dinner what if i just went up there and then it cut off the pressure was gone went up there and what grabbed the camera ive always wanted and started taking pictures i did i cursed the cold bundled up grabbed my new gear and lost myself in the woods taking pictures of snowflakes and a family of deer that happened to wander though ive been shooting the camera for the last week and i cant put it down i feel something im really fucking good at this and im motivated to do it my worst impulses have been stopped in their tracks and replaced by the desire to improve and surprise myself its always going to be a struggle for me and i know that but i feel free in a way that i never really expected also posted in rgettingoverit if its not allowed to post in two subs let me know and ill delete,pre-pandemic,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0

venting is one thing but when someone says overly negative things about themselves and another says me too it reinforces those beliefs then someone looking at these comments might think that its ok to engage in that thinking too it turns into a virus almost im not saying that its wrong i understand the negative things that flow through your head when depressed but i think its important that people dont accept them as the truth depression is bad enough reinforcing negative ideas about ourselves will only make it worse theres a point where it becomes less about venting and turns into too much negativity i may come across as insensitive in this post but ive realized through my struggles with depression you have some control over your thoughts if you let them get out of control they can take you to a dark place,pre-pandemic,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

i went to a cancer support group i have cancer and i am not getting it treated for a variety of reasons i still wanted to go because even though the cancer will eventually kill me and i am ultimately okay with that the process is no less painful or frightening or isolating for that i have no one in my life that i can talk to about this especially not my husband who is one of the reasons i am letting the cancer kill me so i sought out a support group i did what everyone says you are supposed to dotm in situations like this i told the group upfront that i was not getting my cancer treated that i had my reasons and that i would understand if they didnt want me there because i am not seeking treatment i tried to anyway one member interrupted me immediately to tell me i was disrespectful to the group and its members just by being there someone else chimed in and told me to told to go cry about dying of a treatable cancer you chose not to treat somewhere else a third person blamed me personally for being the reason why we can look at survival stats and say they are probably better than stated that person also said i personally was the reason cancer is so traumatizing said that by not seeking treatment i was actively harming people who wanted to live and repeatedly told me that having treatable cancer is a gift that i was squandering then they called me a faggot and told me to go fuck yourself with a switchblade and drink a gallon of bleach this all happened within the full view and hearing of the support groups moderatorleader at no point did they say or do anything to indicate that they thought anything this member said was wrong or inappropriate in the end they told me that i was not welcome in their group and banned me they let the people who insulted me stay and they said encouraging words to the person who called me a faggot and told me to kill myself even beyond the whole ordeal of going to a support group fearing that i might not be welcome there and having my fears so suddenly and violently and finally confirmed im also shaken up by that one persons specific choice of insult they called me a faggot thats bad enough but for me it feels especially bad because its not even the right insult for someone of my sex gender identity and orientation i am a bisexual woman not a gay man i am also not someone who looks or sounds traditionally feminine and that has absolutely been an issue throughout my life i am a squat broadshouldered shorthaired and frankly ugly woman with a deep voice and yes i am fat and when you put all of those together i have been called butch many times in my life i think the most feminine i have ever looked was at my wedding and that was only because i wore a dress so no i dont like being called a man and i have been called a man or mannish many many times including today tldr went to cancer support group got called man and a faggot even though i am a cisgendered woman got told to kill myself got personally blamed for cancer being shitty because i am not treating my cancer and feeling more isolated than ever,pre-pandemic,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0

i made this account as a throwaway half a year ago and literally nothing has changed well not literally i do some photoshop work for people sometimes paid sometimes not i watch more movies now and im trying to draw and play video games a bit as well as fuck around with a guitar now and then i posted my life situation a while ago it was the reason for creating this throwaway but after all that nothing is different nearing on six months since i vowed to feel better and i still feel nothing inside everyone told me to just run away but its really not that easy i wanted to i tried i got my ged and was going to take the sats but at the time i was waiting on a payment on my van still havent heard from him and cant even bother to go through the effort of repossessing it as it would cost a few hundred dollars to do and my family wasnt supportive t all when i told my mom i wanted to go to college theres a highway out my front door that leads to a college like 8 miles away and planned on getting a loan to do so after i got an opportunity to take the sats and i got yelled at told how stupid of an idea it was and got compared to my older sister who had no idea what she wanted out of life and took 3 years of business classes at the community college for a business degree which she did absolutely nothing with and has been constantly stressed out over because she cant pay it back and is unhappy shes a very material person and is avoiding paying on her student loans at all and its just going to end up ruining her life because shes working retail and can barely afford to make ends meet and i was basically told that even though i had a plan tefl in an asian country either japan or korea i really didnt care which id end up as miserable as her anyways i was basically told by my mother that i was stupid to want to go to college and put myself in debt and when i mentioned to my father that i was planning on trying to get a well paying job and move over to either japan or korea or some asian country to teach i was told that anyone would have to be stupid to want to leave this country and go over to those places not just stupid crazy even it wasnt much but it really set my depression off and even if that wasnt enough to kill my confidence in going through with it the fact that it got to me was enough to tell me that i wasnt stable enough to even bother trying because i know id face more than that on my road to finding something worth living for and i just dont think i could take it i just really i have no idea what to do everything is terrible and only a few things have kept me from suicide rpicrequests is one of them i love helping people out on there it makes me feel almost happy on some days people like my work enough to buy me pizza twice now or send me gift cards or pay me in cash for my work lately its been a struggle to even open up photoshop i cant be bothered anymore the fuckface who kept stalking me and belittling me on there didnt help much either im losing interest in helping out anymore getting burnt out on graphic design after that theres only a few things that im wanting to do ive always wanted a tattoo probably getting one next month homage to my favorite character in my favorite book series that got me into reading in the first place i want an eyebrow piercing ive always wanted one since i was a kid but was too afraid of getting in trouble for it or getting bullied im talking elementary school here its been that long i was too worried about looking different i just wanted to blend into the crowd i want to get those and i will might be a month or two but i will ive seen both batman movies in this newest trilogy in theaters and ive been waiting on the newest one for a while theres a book series i want to reread those are the only things in my life i can honestly say i am looking forward to im bored with life absolutely and completely bored out of my mind my depression seems to come and go some days im really sad other days i feel nothing today is one of my better days and i still feel this way ive felt this way for a very long time and i see no hope of not feeling this way in the future if i can save up some cash and maybe sell some things perhaps find a way to get some cash out of that fucking van that im still owed 800 on then i might buy a beat up motorcycle on the cheap ive always wanted to see the untainted night sky from the desert i cant afford insurance or even a license but if i can hold out long enough to get a cheap motorcycle and find my way out of this fucking house then there might be hope still that i can find something that will awaken the ability to comprehend and process happiness for the first time since ever it really just feels like im kidding myself thinking i could ever succeed with that idea though,pre-pandemic,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1

i wish i wasnt born with this de habilitating disease i find it hard just to wake up and do more than the bare minimum needed to survive anyone else wish they could just have the motivation to do things without thinking twice about it for instance i got promoted at work but its so hard doing the homework needed for me to gain the knowledge to do this position other people in similar circumstances found it easy to just do the work but its just a chore for me and when i try to do it its just brings so much psychological pain that it makes me feel physically ill so i go off and do leisurely things anyone have any tips to combat this,pre-pandemic,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0

i feel unmotivated lonely and like i dont have a goal in life massive guilt has been pushing me down for two years now ive thought about harming and killing myself multiple times but lately since i know im getting hospitalized i feel like i dont deserve to go there ive never actually harmed myself or attemted suicide and i feel like im taking away a spot in that hospital from someone whos problems are way worse i definately know that i have thoughts from time to time which are extremely bad and sometimes make me suicidal but they always go away at some point its so hard for me to know if im depressed i always feel like i cant say im depressed because there are probably others who feel way worse and would laugh at my problems,pre-pandemic,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1

ive had a bunch of stuff happen to me in the past month i got appendicitis and surgery still recovering accidentally twisted my ankle i got a cold which im still fighting however none of that seemed to be enough for people to give me a break from emotional labor they demand it from me 247 practically not asking for advice really just ranting these are just a few examples i had my sister calling me talking about her boyfriend who just drinks all the time and does nothing and she was complaining about how she hates where she works i tell her to get rid of the man and get a job somewhere else it wasnt as short as it sounds i listened to her and gave her serious advice though i know she wont take it because she never does instead of thanking me no one ever does she tells me that its easy for me to tell her to just get another job because i dont have one and can just sit around and sleep well thanks i just love sitting around and thinking about my crappy life it is a positive joy we hadnt spoken until her son ended up in an issue and of course the family therapist me gets a text asking me to talk to her son and try to get him to listen to reason i agree just because i know my nephew doesnt get good support from her come to find out shes mad because hes dating some girl who has a kid already i cant say its great at his age but hes also an adult so i just told him to be careful watch out for emotional abuse and reminded him of his last relationship which was like a copy of his moms relationships she doesnt realize he gets his bad examples from her after talking to him his mom texts me and is like im getting off work in a few hours ill call and we can do a threeway call and talk to him nowhere did she ask me if this was okay didnt ask if i was busy or anything but as with most of my family since im at home i never have anything important to do so they just tell me to do stuff instead of asking like im a human being i tell her i texted him and i was still recovering and needed to sleep she didnt ask me what i was recovering from if i was okay nothing just said okay night my niece had trouble at school and shes a lot like my sister unable to let go of things shes upset because some girl at school wants to fight her because my niece took her chair a chair this girl wasnt using mind you but that was just sitting next to her my niece calls me upset and frantic over this because the girl wont let it go and went to the office and had my niece called out of class because the girl wanted an apology my niece refused because she said she hadnt even done anything and she went to the principal who told her that the girl is known for keeping things going so she wouldnt be bothered again but my niece wouldnt get off the phone until i promised to stay up until she got out of school in case they call her into the office again and she wanted me to talk to them a huge reason i dont have kids is so i dont have to deal with the stress of dealing with teachers and other parents yet i have to be a parent to my niece because my sister wont be mind you i had just come back from the doctor had been hopped up on pain meds and wanted to do nothing but sleep i forced myself to stay awake but thankfully no one called then my sister calls me and is crying telling me how much she wants her boyfriend to leave the house so i dont say anything and just let her talk finally shes like i just dont know what to do or how to get him out of my house i told her to call the police she doesnt want to get him in any more trouble because he has a dui because he drinks and drives she allows him to drink and drive her car because he doesnt have one and doesnt have a license i wont even touch how stupid that is so i get frustrated with her and tell her that i keep telling her how to get rid of him and she never listens so i dont know what she wants me to do she acts like i offended her and is like i just called to vent cant i vent sometimes i tell her that she can but im tired of getting calls almost every week about this man im not her therapist or life coach or anything im barely hanging on by a thread a lot of days and hearing about this situation distresses me because even if i dont like her very much i dont want to hear about anyone dealing with this type of stuff not to mention her best friend was killed just a few months ago by her boyfriend who was abusive and drunk a lot make him leave before he gets to that point anyway she accuses me of making it about me and hangs up maybe i did make it about me but i want people to understand that i am not a therapist and i cannot fix their issues and im not emotionally well enough to take on all this stuff im not sure anyone is tbh finally we come to today my mother had to take me to the doctor because i couldnt get there on my own and need support to get there were talking about normal stuff then shes like arent you tired of just sitting at home and doing nothing you really need to get out and get a life i dont ever like talking to my mom about my mental health because she acts like its a phase that should have been over in my teens and she doesnt understand why im letting it bother me as an adult id like to mention she has horrible anxiety as well but she powers through it to work at least it still takes over her life she also doesnt do much outside of the house and has no life but when i point that out she brings it back to me anyway i tell her i just paid all the bills and since the bills got higher i dont have money to have a life even if i wanted to so then shes like if you get a job youd have more money i know this but i have tried many times to hold a job i cannot do it for more than a few days without having panic attacks and breakdowns which either end up with me leaving or getting let go which then leads me into a deep depression she acts like i dont try and this is even with medicine and therapy sometimes im sure the main reason none of this works is because im around my family but i never tell them that because i dont want to deal with that fallout at this point im just tired of the conversation so i dont respond then she brings up how i need to get some friends at least says the woman who literally has one friend and who got upset at my aunt for going out without her even though she never goes anywhere when she invites her heavy eyeroll anyway i tell her that ive tried to have friends its not my fault they dont put effort in and either they end up not talking or i fade out because nothing is happening she asks me why i dont hang out with the people i met last summer the two girls i met last summer were nice but one would rarely go out with us because she would rather stay in with her boyfriend which left me and the other girl we hung out a few times but then she got a new trivia group and stopped texting me back so i stopped texting her and let that fade out this happens too often so i stopped trying to make friends i tell my mom that i dont talk to them anymore and shes like thats your problem you dont try and cut people off so quickly i texted the second girl every day for a week she wasnt working at the time and she was always posting snaps so i knew she was available i wasnt going to keep texting for no reason i try to have boundaries and get crapped on for them unfortunately i am not one of those people who will keep trying and trying and trying when i see things obviously arent going along anymore she then goes into this long story about how she met her only friend and how they only talk like once a month but they are still good friends and i need to be more realistic with friends what good is a friend whom i only talk to for 10 minutes once a month and hang out with maybe once every three months if that works for her great but thats not getting a life or anything else plus i have a history of getting friends and then i become the therapy friend and i fade away because all they ever do is come around to dump their problems on me and get advice then i dont hear from them for months when something else is going wrong thats not friendship to me and go back to my mom and my aunt my aunt is mad at my mom for checking up on her at her age and of course i get pulled into it because my mom is being childish and wont talk to my aunt so ive been designated the gobetween but i never said i would be they are 20 years older than me why am i even in this i dont know im just tired of being everyones therapist and mediator i keep trying to explain how draining it is they obviously see i have my own issues but they continually pour their issues onto me expect sincere helpful empathetic responses but let me feel bad or need something and everyone is busy or doesnt answer their phones or i get advice that isnt helpful my niece and nephew would probably talk but i dont want to burden them with my issues their mother does that to them enough and they complain about it to me of course what is it about me that makes everyone think im a therapist plus none of them pay me for my services that probably makes me more upset than anything if i was a real therapist id probably be rich off all these sessions lol,pre-pandemic,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0

i turned 21 today i live in one of the biggest college towns in the country when you turn 21 here its a big deal i just finished my third year of college and my third year of having absolutely no friends im not the party type or anything but it still is a bummer not to have a single friend to share the occasion with today i received three texts more than most days one from my mom my dad and my cousin wishing me happy birthday in all fairness i dont have a facebook and i dont expect people to memorize by date of birth or anything but it still feels really sad not to hear back from anyone i guess ive never been comfortable with having a facebook the idea of being so interconnected which each others lives and making daily status updates is such a foreign concept to me but i think in not having a facebook ive sacrificed my social life absolutely anyways ive spent the entire day in my room with the lights off trying to drink away the depression of today and of college there is not a single person who if i called them right now they would pick up and talk to me ive been fighting with my parents and after a few shared unpleasantries are not answering my calls because they want we to cool off and understandably so ive been no contact for ever a year with my girlfriend i knew from highschool who i ended up dating long distance when we started college today i made an attempt to call her went to voicemail to ask her if shed let me take her out to lunch as friends to catch up but i havent heard from her it really breaks my heart that i lost that person who was my best friend for a good part of my life i assumed she would have remembered today was my birthday i certainly didnt forget hers anyways if youve made it this far from the bottom of my heart thanks for listening to me vent edit the reddit community has been absolutely amazing you guys have been sending me happy birthday wishes from all corners of the globe ive been getting offers for people to buy me drinks and some have even given me their cell numbers to talktext me if i was still feeling down you guys are unbelievable you turned what was a miserable day for me into one of the most memorable birthdays ive ever had from the bottom of my heart thank you for all of you who took the time to help a stranger on the internet thank you your words of encouragement have lifted up my spirit exponentially i cant say it enough thank you thank you thank you,pre-pandemic,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1
when someone seems depressed or suicidal normies feel compelled to do something but cant really be bothered so they do the following copy paste suicide hotline links and write pm me if you need to talk suicide hotline links are about the laziest most slap in the face shit you can do to someone whos actually posting suicidal shit if they are posting it they obviously want to talk about it wherever it is that they posted it not be directed to a hotline they could easily google just dont say anything then but your egos just need to feel youre heroes right pm me if you need to talk is just as retarded but worse as instead of giving them a referral to contact allegedly equipped strangers youre giving them a referral to contact you a person is fucked up and now you put a burden on them to pm a total stranger for some reason and think of what to say cause talk is so conveniently unspecific and useless because you didnt even have to bother to prove youre someone theyd want to talk to of course why would you someone amazing like you is doing them a favor just by making this offer let them take the initiative right you didnt do absolutely anything when it comes to reaching out except youll still feel like you did with your super generous offer to be given attention and acknowledgment as a potential savior of the suicidaldepressed the person youre sending this shit to already said something if you have anything of value to say to that either reply properly or pm them with the reply demonstrating you want to talk and give them something to go by if you dont have anything to say dont burden them go fuck off and post references on askreddit since repeating what youve heard and seen before is the best contribution you have to offer its ok it will get you upvotes every time i see this exchange i wish i could reach out through the screen grab the normie saying this by the throat and tear it out so that i get to pull it in back into my universe while their dead body without a throat remains in theirs and everyone wonders what happened then they see the last thing they wrote was pm me if you need to talk soon a pattern is noticed and an urban legend created making these words a taboo no one dares to say ever again,pre-pandemic,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,1

what i used to feel i used to believe in karma i used to believe in a cosmic unknown force that doled out punishment for your bad deeds and rewarded you for your good ones it was irrational i knew that but i kept that idea held tight in the back of my mind it would dictate how i interpreted events in my life it often brought on shame once i twisted my ankle stepping off of a bus on my way to class i suffered a frature deep in my ankle and was in a cast for a month i attributed that ordeal to bad karma it was punishment for dating my friends exgirlfriend it was what i deserved does this thought sound familiar to anyone with that line of thinking i knew that i should be ashamed of myself every unfortunate occurrence was because of some cosmic judge giving me retribution i felt soaked in guilt i would even feel the need to punish myself i felt like such a bad person i was hurting myself the lesson believing in karma was feeding my depression it was nothing but a rusty filter that corrupted experiences it made setbacks seem like catastrophes i felt judged by others all of the time as if they could see my guilt please let go of that filter things really are not as bad as they seem its all about how you view the world and its your choice even if you dont know it yet,pre-pandemic,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

firstly to all the women reading this just thank god every single day he didnt make you a man in this horrible decade you have so much privilege and you dont even know it you dont have to do humiliating stupid things like this and look stupid in front of everyone like i do so after feeling depressed about seeing all my friends from high school basically stop hanging out with me because they are all in relationships in college now and their girlfriends take up all their time and attention and of course im the only awkward pathetic loser whos left out i decided that tomorrow im gonna actually ask some girls out directly and probably get rejected look stupid and get laughed at by everyone near by but i guess i have to degrade myself at this point because its the only way i have absolutely no idea how relationships form normally so this is the only way i know how to do it ive never been in a relationship before so this will be my first time doing this i basically know what response to expect its either i already have a boyfriend or fuck off creep yup women get complimented by poor bastards like me and their egos are so inflated they can respond like that but doing something like this is unimaginably difficult for someone like me with anxiety problems and low self esteem it really is i have to fight with myself just to spit out a few words with anyone that is very hard for me to do without stuttering and shaking but thats reality for most men these days goddamit i wish i was born a girl i would have everything in life handed to me if i wanted a boyfriend i would get one simply by existing i hate my life i really do but as a man i have to suffer struggle and fight to the death just for the smallest bit of happiness in life because thats my fate as a man ive been cursed by god to be born as a man in 2017 i must have done something horrible in a previous life to be made like this im convinced of that and honestly if i get rejected enough times and laughed at enough times tomorrow im just gonna drive into a fucking tree i just cant live with myself anymore hopefully ill be reborn a female and finally live an easy life,pre-pandemic,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1

i cheat because ive always had low self esteem and every opportunity that presented itself i saw it as something i could not let pass whether i had a girlfriend or not i cheat because i have never really loved any girl i am with them because i dont want to be alone i make awesome things for them because i want to feel loved but then since i dont love back i cheat and it doesnt bother me i cheat because i feel the pressure to have had lots of female companions ive cheated even though i didnt want to or wasnt that interested in the girl it was an opportunity that could not be let go i cheat because i tell myself that you must try every possible thing in order to make sure what you really want but then i lie about it so it doesnt really make sense ive cheated most of my girlfriends some of them still see me as a saint im so very sorry,pre-pandemic,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1

i would say i am as depressed as anyone else who would call themselves extremely depressed however one thing that annoys me are the people who say theyre depressed that have it all im short ugly dark overweight and have a small penis and besides one of those i cant change any of it ill never have a girlfriend because of it mostly the inadequate height and i sometimes get super depressed for being lonely im not very picky but there are certain girls i wont date like lesbians transwomen shallow women mean and rude women etc i just want someone nice and sweet but my genetic shortcomings will make that a near impossibility as women do not like short inferior men so it seems like my depression makes sense what i dont get however are the people who seem to have it all and are still depressed like attractive women how can beautiful gorgeous women possibly be depressed they are loved by everyone and tall people the world treats you like gods i would fucking kill to be tall how can the social elites in society be depressed and rich and famous people how can an early 20something from a wealthy family be so depressed or someone with millions of fans worldwide and people with two loving parents i never even had one loving parent so how can people with a loving family be so depressed and people in relationships i really dont get this one you are depressed yet you are able to get a boyfriend or girlfriend somehow usually being depressed would make someone so negative theyd repel others away from them yet here these people are with a loving partner and getting laid wheneve they want yet still depressed i have no sympathy for these people at all i still dont even get how someone who is depressed can even be positive enough to even get a partner unless they are tallattractive that is and like i said i dont understand that either the recent december 2017 death of adult film star august ames really got to me though she was tall gorgeous really attractive and had a successful adult film career yet some sjw assholes on twitter bullying her for not wanting to risk getting an std from a male film star was enough to drive her to suicide i normally dont feel sad for deaths but suicides usually get to me especially those of people who seem to have it all i would think i wouldnt care about those people at all but i just do as a former suicide attempter i just feel bad about successful suicides even from tall attractive wealthy women with legions of fans maybe im just jealous i fucking hate being short as being under six feet is the main reason i cant get a girlfriend so i deeply envy men over 60 and women over 59 im ugly so i deeply envy people so attractive they get people flocking to their feet to want to be with them im old 31 so i hate seeing these 19 year olds who complain about being forever alone just barely out of puberty while i have 12 years more experience than them in the same field and yes i am a forever alone as i cant even find any straight escorts around here theyre all either lesbians or traps there are tall gorgeous women in a relationship with a steady job who are depressed and im sorry but i just dont have any sympathy for you maybe if a loved one of theirs suddenly died or something but not over petty first world problems like your boobs being too big or having too much positive attention from others or having too much money to spend at once and i know everyones problems are valid to them some would argue i shouldnt complain about being short when they dont even have legs to walk on so i get it but i still cant feel any sympathy for these people i dont know maybe you can help make me understand the tall the attractive the rich the extroverted the successful the loved the nonsingle especially i just dont sympathize with your depression you have it all so i just dont get it,pre-pandemic,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1
the short version of the story is that i believe this depression could be alleviated if she would just take responsibility for her actions and actually apologize to me she cheated on me and when she dumped me i told her i loved her and id forgive her well we kept talking as the weeks went by talked about getting back together multiple times and each time we did she went out that night and fucked the guy she cheated on me with and later bragged to me about it i was upset she went out of her way to be as horrible as possible to me i cant stand it now im getting threats from her friends and mine that im going to get my ass beat if i dont accept she did nothing wrong and im just being an asshole i have done nothing but express my desire to forgive her but everyone is so determined to white knight that ive lost everything i cant believe i could be betrayed so heavily and the meds arent exactly helping,pre-pandemic,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0

i have an extreme fear of making mistakes up to a point where i hurt myself or spend sleepless nights for doing even minor mistakes at the moment its so extreme that i need to show you an example of how farfetched these things are so there was this small music festival today with some bands that match my taste of music but are widely unknown yet and i heard about it like 2 hours before its beginning time regarding the long car ride and the high ticket price im somewhat short on money but it would have still been affordable it was just not enough time to decide and i am currently experiencing one hell of a depressive episode so i stayed at home started doing random things whatever and of course i started looking up the artists at some point one of the bands sounds very similar to kings of leon and i dont know why but in my head theres lately often been this scenario im daydreaming of where i meet the girl of my dreams at some show while kings of leons song pyro is played anyway once it was too late to change my mind my fucking brain immediately started portraying the missed chance since then im tortured by thoughts like man what if this was your only chance to meet such a person theres only this one show the whole year all other shows just play electronic and dance musicthis was your chance some people believe in fate you knowwhatever then i also remember how much ive lost interest in looking for just some girl im just no longer interested in girls who get drunk who go partying who i meet on most of these electronic dance shows since theres no other choice in my area anyway i feel like im seriously in need of a serious mature relationship and i always feel like im hopelessly searching for the one its so weird but 2 years ago i would have never even thought about the idea of having children i just had some relationships but none of them was mature now im 23 and having a serious relationship without all that superficial crap is what im longing for sorry that i switched a bit off the topic and more into dreaming but i feel like im on a hopeless search for something unreachable and for every yet so little chance that i miss i hate myself more and more,pre-pandemic,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

im starting to think that depression is just a fake symptom that i am putting blame on nowadays everyone claims to be depressed i dont even know if its real or not anymore there is no known mechanism neurologically hormonally physically etc that causes it it is a set of symptoms that the doctors have agreed are worth writing prescriptions for its not even a rigid set of symptoms the way to test is by asking verbal questions then the answers the patient gives are open to interpretation im sure some of us have been tested before the answers they score low and high on dont matter its just an aggregate over all questions in the verbal test i think depression might be total baloney i hope that if i never associate with it again and forget about it it wont exist in my head anymore,pre-pandemic,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

so i am a pretty horrible person especially lately my relationship with my boyfriend is basically dead mostly for me i think he still loves me we havent had sex for a year or so and none of us have made any effort to fix this i thought my reason for not wanting sex was because it hurts for me im depressed duh and maybe because of the medications im taking then i met a guy we had sex a couple of times when i was drunk as fuck basically blacked out i figured it was just a rough spot it didnt mean anything it hurt etcetc this weekend we were sober he figured my pain was related to stress knots in my vagina and proceeded to massage them out the sex was amazing and i feel like i actually want sex again im not in love with him or anything i just want sex it feels weird as fuck as you can guess i havent told my bf about this i wont tell him for a little while either because im unemployed and cant afford to move which i will have to when we break up every day i pretend everything is fine tell him i love him etc and i do this just because of self preservation not because i dont want to hurt him and its not like i love you but as a friend its more you feel more like an aquaintance to me and i dont respect you ive cheated in relationships before but then ive used it as a means to end the relationship for good because i didnt trust myself to manage to break up properly now i just dont feel anything about it i dont feel horrible about it its just nothing of course i feel bad for my boyfriend who trusts me but its more like how one reacts when hearing about other people being cheated on it doesnt feel like this is someone ive fallen out of love with its more like hes a stranger i dont really care about he hasnt done anything to deserve this hes a really nice guy i just feel myself becoming more and more detached from everything im not in love with the other guy i just want sex mostly because ive never had painless sex and didnt know it could be this good thats all i currently care about i am a narcissistic bitch and i dont really want to be like that but i just dont care enough to do anything about it breaking up feels more like a hassle than anything else of course i should have broken up with him months ago or at least after the first time i had sex with the other guy i know how hell feel when i tell him everything ive been cheated on before its devastating knowing the one you love and trust have done these things behind your back and lied to you i just dont care i dont like not being able to care about it i want to change and i dont know how treating people like this and not feeling anything about it is so wrong to me and i dont want to be like this im trying to live with my depression as best as i can i take medications and try not to worry about everything being more content with myself this feeling of not caring about something like this is so wrong i dont want it to last tldr dead relationship fucked a guy will probably do it again havent told bf dont care just trying to get a job so i can move has this happened to anyone else here was it just a phase how did you change if you managed to,pre-pandemic,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0

originally on facebook its okay i believe in god please excuse the typos i wrote this in notepad which has no spell check and im too lazy to reread this well as expected people reached out to me after my last note there were those who were explicit in their attempts to cheer up and those who implicitly just sent me a text out of the blue as if they didnt read it maybe they didnt who knows all i know is i appreciate them both i felt so bad the only thing on my mind was asking them if they knew where i could find some weed i didnt ask because im not one to impose i have a psychological addiction to weed i went from smoking a vaporizer every day to nothing at all the shock to my system has caused a chemical imbalance the last time i smoked was 2 weeks ago and the last time i smoked before that was another two weeks so i went from smoking every day to about once or twice a month im going through withdrawls ive been scrounging for the last half a year my main connection was a good friend of mine but we had a falling out and he doesnt talk to me anymore its my own fault i can be a bit of an asshole sometimes drugs have ruined my life ive done lots lsd mushrooms mescaline mdma not alot i have more fingers than the times ive done these drugs but they opened up my mind i learned there is a world out there that surrounds us all the time that is far greater than anything we can imagine im reminded of platos parable of the cave for those who dont know platos parable ill retell it here imagine a prisoner chained to a wall in a cave with a fire behind him he was chained here his entire life all he knows of the world are the shadows cast by the fire behind him thats all he experiences then imagine one day he wakes up and his chains are off he gets up and turns around he sees the fire it is an incredible sight then imagine he goes further and exits the cave and sees the world for the first time the world would be greater than anything he could ever imagine this parable or story was platos belief in a perfect world beyond our comprehension platos perfect world is comparable to heaven and indeed the story was picked up by later philosophers who had strong ties to christianity particularly the neoplatonists but i wont get into that the question at hand is does it exist ancient jewish beliefs say no this world we live in is already heaven for all intents and purposes this is it i personally have had stepped out of the cave and glimpsed the perfect world i had an experience on dmt where i completely disconnected i teleported to a perfect world and i was in a dank apartment the whole time i was indoors but it felt like i was outdoors it was fucked for a few moments i was outside the cave i took a heroic dose of dmt from a crack pipe before i could even put the pipe down i started traveling throughout the dimensions at first it was just random ass geometric patterns and shapes flying by inside and out but there was a point where everything just coalesced and i found my self sitting in a marble hall before a great alter upon which an incredibly colorful being laid with a hand on her elbow beckoning me over i stood up at the extreme edges of the room were marble pillars beyond which were the green tops of trees and birds flying by upon a cloudless blue sky for lack of a better word but problably the best word incredible i focused on the being of the center of the room she wasnt wearing any clothes but had no discernable features besides her face which itself looked statuesque i could make out a hairline eyes nose and a mouth but she was all one solid color like a mannequin except she was all colors she kept changing colors like oil upon water except much brighter and vivid i took a few steps closer and stammered youre real youre really real and that is when everything fell apart everything started zooming out at a million miles a second and the perfect picture shattered back into random ass geometric patterns and shapes soon the room came back to me and everything was in a flux flucuating between random ass geometric patterns and shapes and discernable objects my friend who was sitting next to me kept going back and forth between friend and random ass patterns and shapes along with the rest of the room and it kept fluxing back and forth until finally the random ass shapes finally my world stopped and i was back in my friends messy ass apartment i asked him what he saw he said i kept rocking back and forth saying im sorry and thank you over and over but for a moment i was there i saw the perfect idealized world what i learned is it surrounds us all the time its like a dream within a dream and it keeps on going in on itself forever and ever like an onion with infinite layers until finally you hit the ground and start to make sense of the infinite nonsense we probably wont be able to function as our current selves in this ideal world to go back to platos parable of the cave for a second we know what happens when someone is freed from the cave it is called environmental autism and can be read about on wikipedia there was a girl in florida who was confined to a closet her whole life then when she was like 7 or 8 i cant recall she was rescued and adopted by a kind family this girl has permenant learning disabilities and cannot speak it happens to us all imagine what your life would be like if it ended at birth you cant really no one remembers what life in the womb is like but experience tells us what it would be like you live in a perfect little world without a care and all of a sudden the pressure dropswater breaking and then suddenly increasescontraction and the pressure rapidly increases and decreases until you cant take it anymore and you fall outbirth you fall out screaming and crying because all you ever knew came to an abrupt end then the cord is cut and youre greeted by an eternally greatful benelovant beingmom its gonna keep happening rebirth and death when we die were just going to get shoved out into a new world with no idea how to act well have environmental autism unless were lucky and run into a benelovant being that shows us the ropes which brings us to god what is god in order for god to be perfect god would need to be unchanging so that means in each reincarnation god cannot change this means god is not a perceivable being were not going to meet god when we die even if we do encounter a benelovant being upon our expulsion from this worlddeath that being cannot be god that being would change upon meeting us as we didnt exist in its realm before our birthdeath it begs the question what is god god has to be the laws of the universe the rule that allows the other rules to exist we cannot perceive god because we are moving too fast and can only see a limited view like looking at the world through a hole in a sheet were revolving around the sun at thousands of miles a minute which in revolves around the center of the galaxy at a million miles a minute which in turn revolves around a group of galaxies at a million miles a minute so on infinity god cannot be everything we perceive because everything we perceive changes constantly due to our constant motion throughout the cosmos god therefor have to be the center of gravity that which everything revolves upon the famed unmoved mover and we could never perceive this because god is perfect if we were to slow down to be motionless we would be the center of the universe and that would create two seperate centers and a circle with two centers is absurd nay impossible god is therefor everything in the universe acting as one god is self caused because existence exists and is one because there cannot be two centers god is an eternal reference frame the reference frame upon which all other frames of reference exists we are all part of god as god is just the sum of its parts which brings us to emotion why do we kill eachother its simple really it boils down to pain we all dislike pain and avoid it at all costs even if this means increasing the pain of someone else everyone acts in self interest this is known affectionately as desire our desire is to avoid pain and seek pleasure as we are all parts of god we are surrounded by an infinite amount of external forces that either increase or decrease our pain an external force that decreases pain is love and an external force that increases pain is hate love leaves us with joy and hate sadness lets go back to desire i said earlier that desire is acting in self interest therefor pleasure or joy increases our capacity to act and pain or sadness decreases our capacity to act to have no capacity to act is to not be aka death to have a capacity to act is to be aka life and to have a maximum capacity to act is bliss aka freedom only god has a maximum capacity to act and therefor is perfectly free as we are all parts of god we are bound to gods rules the astute reader will realize im saying we are not free and were not there are laws that prohibit our actions and even if society were to perish over night we would still be bound to natural laws that prohibit actiongravity like it or not we are stuck everything is predetermined by god however we do have an idea of what freedom is this is due to forces external from us that give us a greater capacity to act in our own self interest forces that increase our desires love the consequences of this truth say some interesting things about god lets ask a question what is external to god the answer is nothing therefor god cannot love or hate us god is not capable of love or hate god is only capable of maintaining gods own existence which is eternal and perfect god has no desires god is cause initself god is self cause therefor any being capable of self cause is free even though we are bound by god or natures rules we do have some limited freedom we all have the capacity to end our own existence via suicide if the pain of life is too much then death may bring us joy but it will bring sadness to those who love us as the object of that persons pleasure no longer exists all of our choices have consequences the hard part is choosing the right action god may be why we live but gods existence doesnt tell us how to live how do we live if were all subject to gods existence whats the point in living if everything is already predetermined thats just it ultimately there is no point we have to create it ourselves when we do so we experience joy however in doing so we may decrease someone elses joy it is a consequence of living there is no sheriff in the sky keeping tabs on all our actions when were dead were dead does that mean i can do whatever i want yeah it does but someone else may not like whatever you want and decide to end you thankfully we have something called society that limits this from happening societies limits are called laws and they prevent us from doing whatever we want nature has limits too its called death and it prevents us from doing anything we want if you dont believe me go try to fly off a really high building you see were limited however if we act reasonably we can find some degree of happiness we must learn how to live within the limits nature sets before us this can only be done through experience sometimes though life backs us into a corner and were forced to act in a way contrary to reason this is unfortunate so how do we avoid this misfortune trust trust in what laws rules or maxims to live by who determines these laws we do due to us being subject to god or natures laws heed warnings reasonably test the environment dont try to fly from the top of a building try to take off from the ground first dont blindly pursue joy this is called mania and maniacs have no regard for reason and ultimately will get locked up trust other people and if a gun is put to your head well then obiwan itwe dont fear death we fear pain the good thing about pain is it is only temporary this sadly is the bad thing about pleasure follow the rules and have a good time if you disagree with the rules then change the rules this brings us to politics i dont have much to say about politics,pre-pandemic,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0
ive come to the conclusion that ultimately you create your own depression you obviously dont mean to and its so easy for humans to slip into a depressive state if you create it then it stands to reason that you can destroy it and you are the only one who can therapy and medication help they definitely help but theyre never the final fix the final push the final breakthrough has to and can only come from your inner willpower,pre-pandemic,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0

a very large percentage of the serotonin in a persons brain is supplied by the stomach in order for the stomach to be able to supply the serotonin it needs to be backed by solid eating behaviours in particular gluten lactose large amounts of carbohydrates large amounts of processed foods in the absence of fruits vegetables and adequate water intake may in fact be the reason people are as he says today fat and stupid if you watch jps podcast with joe rogan you will find that jp and his daughter both suffered terrible depression and anxiety until they switched to a lions diet an exclusively meat diet over the next few months their mental health made a full recovery jps daughter suffered since a very young age with mental health issues and had hers resolved by a radical shift in her eating habits it would appear that inflammation induced by repeated and chronic ill eating habits or even foods that we are allergic too and eat unknowingly have a massive effect on the psyche personally i was experiencing a long battle with anxiety with some symptoms of depression including brain fog and the inability to express myself or cry which became completely manageable and normal slowly after i quit eating gluten do some research and take it upon yourselves to eat better in order to feel better its worth trying,pre-pandemic,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

it took me 20 years to recognize that i was depressed and another 10 to actually do something about it by seeing a therapist and taking sertraline my problem was and is that i suck at life i got by on 20min of workday in school but that changed and i didnt so i failed at most of the things i started including a 6year relationship two attempts at college and a company last fall i finally faced the music and got on sertraline i always told people that there should be no stigma attached that it does not change your personality etc boy was i wrong yes i felt happier for a while i also slept about 18h a day i did not even notice it until about two weeks ago i was simply once again too lazy to refill the prescription when i went cold turkey i suddenly noticed how much the meds had changed me and not in a good way to put it in simple terms i had gone stupid whereas before and to a limited degree now again i was good with words charismatic and convincing i had become dull when i talked to people it felt like something wasnt right something was off my imagination was nonexistant my creativity stunned i had become bored by my own thoughts but remained unable to come up with new ones i am deeply unhappy now but for some reason i am somewhat productive again the fog that i did not even notice has cleared i am not a good person but at least i am a person when after 150 years of trying modern psychology still cant help a somewhat simple case of depression such as mine maybe they should finally give up but theyre probably too happy to see how much they suck and to gritty to look in the mirror and evaluate themselves pointless rant sorry felt like it yeah by the way cool withdrawal symptoms bro feels like i sat on my brain for too long,pre-pandemic,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0

a good friend of mine with whom ive been attending therapy for bpd overdosed a couple days ago she survived and was transported unconscious to the hospital she woke up but is unsurprisingly devastated i want to be there as her support she has a boyfriend but no family members who care about her and few friends i had plans to see my family for christmas but when this happened it left me deeply depressed particularly because another good friend of mine had committed suicide four years ago almost on the same day to elaborate i dont like spending christmas with my family i like them but christmas has always been more about chores and preparations than about quiet and peace i thought i would spend christmas by visiting my friend in the hospital i dont want her to be alone i know that if i were in her situation i would appreciate it if someone came to visit me so i proposed this to my mother and brother even the possibility that i would spend the afternoon with her and then go down to see them before dinner however their comments left gasping for air they showed little empathy for my friend or me my mother asked me if i had any normal friends my brother told me that while its ultimately my choice i would be ruining christmas by not coming down or even by coming down just for dinner that everyone would be disappointed in me and it would create arguments implying i would be at fault for them heres the breakdown with my family i risk being ostracized for weeks if not months if i dont go down there however ive felt more and more like they were less and less my family while ive felt like my friends have shown more compassion and empathy for my depression and bpd than my family ever has in fact theyve dismissed it as me not having enough social activity as not having enough will and have called my therapy a waste of time i feel like visiting my friend is the right thing to do i know i will think of her the whole time i would be down at my familys but i do not want to be ostrasized for months i dont think i could handle it with my mental condition any and all thoughts are welcome thank you,pre-pandemic,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0
i have never really posted anywhere i cannot really say i have never talked to anyone about anything because i have but the responses are a bit frustrating oh yes i was sad before i went through some mild depression for a little so i know how you feel i suppose i end up with some sympathy when i really want some empathy maybe i need someone to really actually know what i am saying when i say i am having a hard time i dont want to talk or wake up or do anything anyhow the doubting essentially i was diagnosed with depression and anxiety about a year ago i had always wanted to talk to someone im 22 now about how i was feeling or about how i would suddenly freak out because everything seemed so overwhelming when trying to decide where to put a box but had never pulled myself to go until a sudden straight 4 weeks of feeling sleepily numb with a dash of annoyance and selfloathing but now i wonder here or doubt myself because i try to read all these things on depression trying to get a better understanding and i feel many of the symptoms but i feel like im not suppose to be able to laugh or enjoy myself too i dont really understand any of this and i really have no one to talk to because no one gets it i dunno i am babbling just needed to throw it somewhere,pre-pandemic,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0
i am almost a 20 yearold and am a student in college most of my friends are still in high school and they almost all drink or get high frequently you dont need to tell me to try to find better friends i already know that i hate the concept of partying and getting wasted just for the fucking sake of getting completely disoriented more than that i hate what parties represent they represent the fact that many high school students most college students and whoever else has that mindset willingly spend their time with the aim of enjoying completely fucking their conscious selves and reaping the benefits that come with it assimilating into a group of equally ignorant people it doesnt even matter how intelligent you are you could be a physicist and still have this fucking party mindset for instance ill be hanging out with my friend and be having a good time and then out of the blue hell start talking about the fact that the other night he was at a party and super fucking drunk and shit and that he drove home in my head im thinking jesus fucking christ my friends gonna kill himself so i calmly tell him that that is a stupid thing to do and he tries to defend drunk driving he claims that it makes him a better driver when hes drunk because hes more alert for police officers and tries to drive better that is such fucking bullshit that i am at a loss for words there is no arguing with my friend no matter how hard i try to tell him that hes making bad decisions he continues to defend to the point where no matter what i say he will completely deny it on another occasion i asked him why he drinks and smokes and he says that he is the real him when hes drunk or high to me that is fucking pathetic and honestly quite sad that means that all the time that he hangs out with me he is not the real him it just makes me incredibly mad that partying has become his sole sense of enjoyment also recently he has become injured and has received a bottle of oxycontin i fear that he will bring these to parties and kill himself or other people anyway less about the personal side of things i just feel like the entire party mindset as a whole is a fucking moronic thing i dont get what is so god damned incredible about getting drunk or high its not like youre achieving anything that is of any significance youre literally just drinking a fluid or doing drugs youre literally just making yourself lose your sense of reality and getting lost i dont get what the real draw is there when people talk about their fucking experiences like theyre fucking achievements theyre seriously deluded they actually think that having slammed x amount of shots in y amount of time was some incredible achievement or when people talk about how drunk they were like it is something to be proud of like guy 1dude i was so drunk at that party at matts the other night i cant remember how i got home guy 2bro thats so dope i blacked out one night and when i woke up i was under my best friends table guy 1thats sick dude to me that doesnt seem like anything to be proud of but i feel like the majority of people are like that i just think that the mindset of letspartyandgetsuperfuckinhighanddrunkandbeasfucking obnoxiousaswecan just seems like a trashy attitude does anyone agree tldr i hate way that people who party act they act like it is the endall beall of human existence and to me are just completely moronic does anyone agree,pre-pandemic,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1

lately ive been obsessed with huntergatherers see link they only work three hours a day and its more like play than work hunting collecting chatting with friends while you prepare food etc they have no class system are healthier than us and rarely suffer from depression what is there to be depressed about they dont go to school the idea of telling a child what to do was alien to them they spend so much time idling and sleeping that when europeans first met hunter gatherers they always said these people are lazy it seems to me that when the world horrifies us and nobody else understands why we feel so bad when we just want to stay in bed all day when we hate school or work when the only thing we can imagine enjoying is walking in a forest with no worries when our solution to problems is just i want to walk away then we are absolutely correct we see life as it really is and how it really should be when we stay in bed and want the outside world to go away then we are doing it right and our problem is that everyone else is doing it wrong depression is supposed to be ithis rrational thing but almost everything i read on this sub is rational genius is when we come up with some insight that others cannot see well if the only people who can see the benefit of the huntergatherer lifestyle are the depressed people then i guess we must be the geniuses,pre-pandemic,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1
ive been in therapy for years in that ive been able to identify what has made me so depressed growing up and i try to deal with it i spend a lot of time using coping methods and trying my best for a depressed person i manage to excel in life currently dealing with the sting of a breakup went on vacation to asia and ex broke nc before my trip to wish me well after what i gather was him finding out the grass isnt greener im on a dream vacation with my older sister and her child while we visit her fianc a lot of my depression is triggered from a childhood of being parentified and also unappreciated and invalidated my sister spent my formative years teasing me for liking asian culture and is now jet setting to my fantasy destination because of romantic love wasnt enough that i liked something or it meant something to me for her to care or treat me right nope only a man would make her culturally open and respect me and my interests i was livid i had been journaling using positive self talk etc but all i could think is wow people only care about me when i can offer them something creative services language skill advice emotional supportchild careif there isnt a task or skill i can do people rarely give a fuck about me i didnt want to share this and told her i needed a moment to collect myself and she kept bothering me until i cried at a shrine i told her why i was upset and she kept telling me to put it aside because were on vacation i turned on my data to call my mom she told me to pay a tour guide to take me places and hung up on me when i asked to be heard instead of throwing money at my feelings i literally just wanted someone to put themselves in my shoes for 2 seconds and be a brokenhearted 20 something who is the third wheel to a family and a newly wed couple but is trying her fucking best i didnt need to spend more money on experiences i didnt need to pretend i wasnt upset i just fucking wanted someone to walk in my very capable shoes for 30 seconds and realize the only thing i want is a little goddamn empathy my family rarely thanks me for things they dont care unless im in crisis or isolating ive learned to ask for what i need but it doesnt matter because unless i have extreme reactions they cant be bothered to hear me i am happy for my sister i truly am but jfc i am planning and helping with her wedding in the midst of a serious breakup which she also teases me about and infantilizes my heartbreak feelings dont go away because youre on vacation therapy taught me to deal with my shit but unless i act in bad old ways my family doesnt react i am more than a babysitter or a social media paparazzi im part of this family too tldr depression reared its head on exotic vacation talking through issues got me yelled at edit whoathanks for the gold didnt really expect this but if youre a depressed empathy like me i know its hard and i know its lonely trying to do good while being profoundly depressed with people and their actions well get through it,pre-pandemic,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

based on my observations i think being depressed is worse than being a drug addict here are my reasons addicts can get clean of drugs but i feel like depressed people never gets clean of the bad thoughts and always feel like crap even when everything seems to be ok drug junkies often die of overdose after being a short time in the streets usually with a sweet and painless death depressive people often commit suicide after several years of terrible suffering society views addictions as something that just happens because the evil of drugs we often portait drug lords as the responsable for all of the deaths of inoccent people who dies because an overdose on the other hand depressive people is viewed as lazy manipulative and fully responsable of their situation like nothing serious happens to us what do you think,pre-pandemic,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0
warning this post will offend someone i have utterly stopped giving a shit about women because in all the situations i have been a part of witnessed or otherwise have read about a depressed woman can still be in a functional relationship depressed women are allowed to be aggressive violent or otherwise behave in a way thats disgraceful simply because men are expected to be the loadbearers in society and exist solely to take abuse my mom abused me and my dad is indifferent is this the same for every relationship no its not however it is perfectly fine for a depressed female to hit scream claw and spit at her spouse because oh shes depressed and she needs to have an outlet for her episodes a man is depressed suddenly hes unattractive not worth your time or needs to suck it up and be a man this hurts both sides im sorry but as a depressed male i am not allowed to be sad because my depressed face looks very intimidating and scary if youre an effeminate male great you have people willing to be affectionate with you i have not been hugged in years yes i am aware this sounds incredibly onesided and sexist thats because i dont care anymore,pre-pandemic,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1
hello i will start by saying that ive never had to deal with any profound hardship in my young life im only 19 but i am depressed to the point that it is absolutely eating away my drive and motivation i have an extremely high iq 160 and while many people see this as being a gift it has been nothing but a tremendous curse schoolwork has come easily to me but i cant maintain friendships or relationships dont get me wrong im not your stereotypical gamernerdgeek but rather quite the opposite i was a 3 sport athlete my whole life i am in phenomenal shape i have been told i am very good looking not by my mom or grandmother even and i actually have very good interpersonal skills and consider myself to be a little bit of an extrovert the issue in my life has been that i am too smart please dont think that i am full of myself because im not ive tried to blind myself to my own intelligence my whole life and its finally coming to haunt me i am completely unable to connect with people who arent as smart as me i overthink everything and its impossible not to the problem is that i dont have anyone to talk about my deeper thoughts with and i cant find any i go to a highly selective college and even still i am levels above every person ive met the only way ive been able to cope with this is by drinking my intelligence away i cannot begin to describe how blissful it is to feel alcohol working in my system and numbing my mind it is only then when i am capable of shutting my brain up and having a conversation with somebody while being on their level this is the first time ive ever talked about this problem ive never brought it up to anybody because i dont think they would understand and take what i was saying the wrong way i dont believe im better than anybody else but i am a lot smarter im hoping there is somebody here who suffers from the same thing i just want to see that im not alone here,pre-pandemic,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0

so the first video here is an intense example of a bioenergetic release technique this is what i do when im depressed bioenergetic exercise in the second part he goes on to explain in detail the science behind why this technique may work for you what i do when im depressed part 2 bioenergetics body psychology essentially the freak out from the first video is about trying to tune out of the dominant hold of the neocortex which is responsible for our higher reasoning and tuning into the cortex brain stem which are responsible for our emotional and physical desires he makes the case that we get stuck in our higher thought functions and effectively repress the lower aspects of our psychology so by learning how to shut off the neocortex and get in touch with the neglected parts of our brain we can experience a cathartic release worked for me and i hope it helps some of you out too,pre-pandemic,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

i have been depressed for the last 3 years for many reasons check my other post if you are curious one reason however hurts more than the others i am 29 and i never had a girlfriend i lost my virginity two years ago to prostitute because why not i could start dating now the problem is i cannot get over the fact that in terms of experience i will always have the disadvantage how can i get over the fact that whatever woman i date she will always have more experience than me how can i get over the fact that i will never experience virginal love its not the womans fault its mine because i started too late i know that but recognizing that doesnt make it any better whoever i meet will already have a baggage of at least some 3 or 4 relationships this is humiliating for a man even more why me is suicide the only solution because i know myself too well i will never get over this fact so the only way to destroy the fact is by destroying the consciousness that is aware of it,pre-pandemic,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1

i read a lot of posts on here of people struggling with daily debilitating depression that plagues every aspect of their lives making it difficult to do small things like even take a shower i feel that i am on the opposite side of the spectrum and wanted to share that it is equally as horrible from an outsiders perspective i appear to be a very happy and stable individual i have a financially secure job and i go to work every day and not only try my best but actively try to get along with others and make people laugh every day my coworkers like me and some look up to me no one would think i have any problems at all however i feel like i am hidden behind a veil and when i come home from work and when i am in the privacy of my home i am in such crippling depression i have such terrible episodes of sadness i hate myself i overanalyze everything stupid i do or say throughout the day and i replay it in my mind constantly and belittle myself i dont feel proud of myself for any of my accomplishments and genuinely dont know why anyone even likes me and yet i still get up every day live this routine and put on a facade like i am okay it feels like i am living a double life that i cannot escape,pre-pandemic,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

last week my long time therapist committed suicide and i dont know how to cope i feel so alone this wasnt just some therapist off the street he was highly educated well respected and worked with a few institutions selfishly i feel hurt and abandoned everyone is telling me to find a new therapist but not only does that feel like a close friend died get a new friend but so much trust was broken i dont want to open up to a new therapist the thought that keeps running through my mind is if someone who dedicated his life to mental health and had so many resources couldnt get better what hope do i have and also selfishly how could he i know mental health is a beast and i know from his brief mentioning that he was fighting demons but it feels so unfair like my symbol of recovery has been destroyed thanks for listening,pre-pandemic,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1
its really weird my friends in school have no idea about my depression and i like to keep it that way so i always try my best to hide it and i smile and laugh and make jokes and sometimes not very often but still my mood suddenly really gets a bit better but it will disappear immediately when i have a second to myself but its just really weird maybe you can pretend so long that you can actually get happy sounds dumb but hey trying to grasp every little straw here edit its crazy reading how many people can relate thought i was being quite alone with that thanks for all of you sharing your thoughts i guess at some point you are just so low down in that hole that you seriously try anything to make it go away even if it means needing to force yourself through 3 hours fake laughing until for a moment you feel good only for it to be taken away as soon as you have a moment alone to yourself and you would gladly collapse onto the floor and sleep for days,pre-pandemic,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
i was diagnosed with general anxiety disorder when i was 12 or 13 i take medication for it klonopin and for the most part i have it under control i havent had a severe attack in months so i was really surprised today to hear my pcp primary doctor tell me that he thinks im depressed and that hes worried that im killing myself his reason that ive lost weight since my last visit keep in mind that he told me earlier this year that i should gain fifteen pounds i managed to gain seven before leveling off i guess i lost eight since then because according to my doctor i am now severely underweight according to many websites im close to the normal range 112lbs to 126lbs for my height and body type i dont look like a skeleton or anything but my doctor was very blunt he said i had to gain weight and he actually said i should stop joggingexercising until i do i think he thinks im anorexic or something but im not i dont know what to think now he suggsted at the end that i should discuss the possibilty that im depressed with my psychiatrist i dont really want to do that sorry for rambling im high as hell right now,pre-pandemic,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

so i just wanted to share how the last month of my exercise as medicine journey has been going im a person who is not helped much by meds after being on them for about 20 years i walked 16 miles again yesterday and i really get so much self esteem and relief from depression and anxiety from these days when i accomplish herculean efforts but what i realized is that its much much more important for me to build consistency i fell into a pattern for a little while where i would walk really far one day then take two days off then walk again then miss another two days the result was that i fell back into a deep depression with suicidal ideation i worked back up to more consistent walking without the two day gaps and found that i can remain stable for the most part as long as i achieve consistency for me right now that is 34 days of walking sessions per week with no more than one day off in between walking sessions but my goal is to maintain a consistent 56 day a week walking routine i average 10 miles of walking each time i walk its not normal at all for 2 days off to bring me back to a space of near suicidal ideation and so i followed through with adding latuda to my meds as an adjunct to lexapro i also take 1 mg of klonopin daily my hope is that the latuda as an adjunct will balance my chemistry more and give me the extra relief from depression and anxiety i need to remain stable even if i dont work out for a couple of days i should be able to miss a couple days without feeling like im close to a hospitalization so im hopeful that this new strategy will improve my situation the exercise is still working miracles though the 16 miles the other day pulled me out of the hole completely today i did 8 miles i lost 12 pounds in the past 3 weeks also which is great for me because it means my metabolism has finally recovered from the depakote i discontinued a few months ago it was hard to work so hard and lose no weight for a long time but i stuck with it and now im over that hump my self esteem and wellness overall continues to transform from exercise and im still in awe of how much it is helping the added benefit of dropping some weight is that i look better which also helps me to feel better ive been on jenny craig for three weeks now also which no doubt is why i lost 12 pounds it jump started my metabolism its expensive but even when i go off it which will be soon because i cant afford to stay on it i learned some things that i can carry over that are increasing my wellness so im excited that when i let go of the jenny craig these strategies can stay with me the things that are most helpful that i can continue to do without jenny craig are 1 eat a ton of non starchy vegetables and non starchy fruits during the day im actually allowed to have unlimited non starchy vegetables and im finding that green leafy vegetables increases my energy a lot 2 drinking 64 oz of water a day this is just making everything about my body work better without it i notice i cant drop weight no matter how hard i work the water is just this magic ingredient that makes everything else im doing effective my skin is getting better also 3 eating 5 small meals a day instead of 3 my increased positive outlook also prompted me to go through my text threads and delete any that cause me anxiety to glance at as i use my phone i also got rid of old contacts for people i am no longer in touch with who i have negative associations with the exercise decreases the depression and anxiety enough to change my outlook enough so that these ideas about cutting out negativity occur to me whereas before they would not occur to me at all when i fell back into deep depression from taking too many days off from exercising i picked up the habit of staying online for too many hours a day again im cutting down on my hours online again now that im feeling much better the vitamins i started taking have to do with another condition i have chronic daily migraine my neurologist prescribed 100 mg of riboflavin 4x per day and 400 mg of magnesium once a day these vitamins are decreasing the frequency and intensity of my migraines which is great because all the drugs they tried to give me slow down my metabolism and work against my fitness goals ive been walking at night and i just find it so freeing for some reason i think its because im an adult who lives with my retired parents who are always home so this gives me much needed time away from my family finally i have been walking on the beach right next to the coastline and the ocean has been sucking the negativity right out of me i literally get a sensation that the craziness and negativity is being pulled out of me as the waves recede back into the ocean and the pain in my head seems like its getting sucked out of me too so thats how its been going and i just wanted to share this with anyone who might be struggling and finding that their meds are not enough and that relying on meds alone has been failing them as it was me i also found this amazing subreddit its a very supportive subreddit about building positive habits check it out i think theyre onto something over there

3 months ago i found porn on my s0s phone m 19and i f19 consistently had conversations about how i felt about it it makes me uncomfortable i dont care if he watches it but it still makes me feel depressed and miserable i think it makes me upset because porn sets standards how sex should be and even how one should look porn has made me really insecure about my body when we have sex and i know porn isnt meant to do this and im not saying its wrong for anyone to like it its just not my thing i just want to feel beautiful without worrying about how i look when i have sex with my so my so always talks about new things he wants to do in the bedroom and i feel like its ideas from porn i just want our sex life to be separate from porn i dont want to feel like i am doing certain things because he saw it on porn and it really turned him on i want to create our own ideas i want to have sex our way without pressure of doing something wrong its been a challenge and 2 months later i cant seem to feel any better about it even when my so assures me that i am beautiful and porn is nothing compared to me i suffer from depression ive self harmed before and i have low confidence and self esteem i honestly just want someone to relate or understand how i feel and not just say that im stupid for feeling this way it would make me feel a lot better and less alone with this perspective is this a unreasonable feeling update im still having a hard time getting over this i would appreciate some more comments on this problem,pre-pandemic,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1
well first off i want to say im 15 so this post may sound like im whinning also be nice in the comments because im new to reddit so over the years ive noticed that im different from people but mentally different like i think in different ways for example a lot of people teens mostly that i see make judgments so quickly on things like a couple fighting and broke up and people start saying she did it or he did it i try to see both sides of the story or when someone looks different that individual gets bullied so for me i try to stay low profile in school i know its summer now and i shouldnt even think about school and im the type of person who is afraid to have everyone talk about me and im different from a lot og guys in school like i want to shave my legs im into my little pony dont judge me because i havent judged you im a very creative person aswell and if i express that i know for a fact that im going to receive a bunch of hate and i know its bad to care about what people think of you but i do anyway and i do want to be myself and express myself and i try not to let things get to me so how can i be myself while staying low profile in school,pre-pandemic,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
im going to make some very uneducated statements but i believe them in my heart i have never studied psychology although im interested in it and ive only once gone to a therapist for anxiety i think i could very well be classified as depressed however i tick all the right boxes right down to frequent suicidal thoughts lets talk about suicidal thoughts the ones i have are i think very typical for a depressed person its the ones where every train of thought leads to the same destination suicide but not in an emotional way sure every now and then you cry your eyes out thinking about the unbearable sadness that you yes the you you have known your whole life the you that once was a sweet innocent kid with nothing but love and courage in its heart is going to leave this world forever im talking about the rational ones where you see suicide in a purely logical way and it makes sense to you but why why on earth does suicide make sense to you and im not talking about the old philosophy argument that asks is suicide is ever justified aah if the person suffers too much then it is only rational that the person wants to end that suffering by any means im kind of paraphrasing here from a video of a lecture on suicide i saw on youtube the other day sure its an interesting topic nice thought experiments but you could just as easily be talking about if horses should kill themselves or not or made up aliens in a distant galaxy or something its simply irrelevant its irrelevant to the world we live in people are killing them selves more and more people why why are we killing ourselves i feel like if we really think about it if a person would stop for a moment and think of the people on earth how we live our lives how we treat each other and the planet that person wouldnt be surprised that some people just hate themselves they loathe themselves they feel like a cancer and the only solution is to get rid of the cancer to get rid of themselves the point here that i have been trying to make is that i believe depression isnt as great of a mystery as some might think that is we are all people and we know what it means to be deeply sad even the happiest people i believe that if we search deep down in our feelings we know what is the cause of this cancer in peoples minds,pre-pandemic,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
my wife and i started getting into cuckolding a year or 2 ago after 4 years of very happy marriage i believe during those 1st 4 years we saw each other as equals one of her 2 main bulls has become very authoritative he likes to command both me and my wife around which we both find so hot but i think my wife is genuinely losing respect for me as she sees me jumping to obey him the other night they were in bed together as i just kind of waited in the other room when i heard my wife yell theres no way im doing that its gross get your little girlfriend to do it they then called me in and he requested i lick his ass in front of my wife so i knelt behind him and started licking thinking it was so hot but i looked up at my wife after a couple minutes and just saw absolute disgust on her face i think that was the nail in the coffin for her now i can tell even when there are no bulls around she thinks of me as lesser she gives me commands and i do them in an attempt to please her this is no longer a marriage of equals she lets me know how things are going to be and i follow i cant decide if i find this hot or this is a path to destruction last night she got back from a long day and said she wanted her ass licked while she was on her laptop i obviously really wanted to so bad but didnt want to always jump to her every command so said i wasnt in the mood and just wanted to relax she absolutely ridiculed me for licking his ass but not hers calling me a sissy etc by the end of her rant i was begging to let me lick her back there but she wouldnt let me and called over her bull i felt so incredibly dumb for not giving her what she wants based off stupid male pride i talked with our bull about maybe being less mean and commanding of me and i got sure sure but nothing has changed fast forward to an hour ago and pretty much everything is gone she left me for him and ended it via text i feel terrible,pre-pandemic,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

there is only one therapy group in my city that i can afford actually i cant even afford them until i get a job but its them or nothing and really given that ive been trying unsuccessfully to find a job any job for the last three years i know its never going to happen but its pretend i have hope or commit suicide by cop problem is the therapist actually a psychiatristpsychologist mdphd and everything is an idiot who says and does stupid hurtful things out of spite like lying to me about medication sideeffects or even what medication hes prescribing me no doc antipsychotics are not the same as antidepressants i dont care where you got your degree from like grinning and asking did that make you feel better after i had a small breakdown in his office like talking about his family for 30 minutes out of a 45minute session while i was sobbing uncontrollably and not so much as offering me a tissue from the fresh box of tissues sitting next to him and throwing the box at my head when i asked for one like calling me a racist for ranting about my old bosss obnoxious mother who happens to be indian and who my old boss gave an office and salary despite her having no official duties or doing anything else all day but call the white women fat ugly whores and separate incident an honesttogod panic attack i had while on the phone with customer service about some unauthorized charges on my phone bill when i couldnt understand the representatives accent which i assume was indian or pakistani his actual words watch it or were through here today do you understand me like clicking his teeth shaking his head and saying well im impressed youve managed to stay so fat then when i explained to him that some weeks ive had to choose between therapy sessions with him and eating every day like bragging about how he rented a lakefront house for 3000 per day while knowing that i have not had work in three years like repeating every word i said during another breakdown in his office as in youre right you havent had an interview in eight months and cant even get a job bagging groceries okay you dont have any money and cant afford to keep the lights on and that makes you a bad person yes and so on no commentary no sympathy no advice just repeating every work i said right back at me like picking up the phone and waving it in my face as he slowly dialed 9 1 and 1 again all the while lecturing me on how i needed to control myself because it was so easy to get hysterical white women like me committed involuntarily i had broken down and started slapping myself after he repeated every thing id said right back at me and this was his enlightened response and worst of all as i discovered today flagging my file at the clinic so that i cant see any doctor therapist or counselor at the clinic but him i tried calling another psychiatrist just so i could at least get medicine that could actually work on me but no dice anything i want or need at the clinic now has to go through him i cant appeal to anyone at the clinic because he is a tenured professor at the local medical school and a senior partner in the clinic i did file complaints with his school and my state medical board but i know they wont do anything because hes only metaphorically fucked me i keep telling myself something is better than nothing and i believe it less and less each time if and when i quit coming to therapy i dont know what i will do or what i can do i know what i should do but i dont want to traumatize some innocent cop just yet,pre-pandemic,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,1

atm is somewhat glib because in truth it has on average been much more now than just a moment moments there are still though im much improved i must admit it can be oddly hard to admit that i think as if some gremlin apologist for depression sits upon your shoulder convincing you that youre just as poorly off as before that youre just as under threat i full expect a return to bad times if only to protect myself from disappointment something you dont need more of when restricken with depression but for a couple months now ive been able to breathe alright i dont post this to brag but i recall appreciating such posts when i was rotting in those abominable depths so um like said posts many ended with something encouraging andor uplifting so er heres my attempt at that your soul isnt gone you just need to work on object permanence what you know to be true ie that youll never feel anything other than what you do now is not true pride stubbornness desire for continuing emotional selfvalidation or denial out of blind selfdefense against that actuality must be recognized as such put in its proper place of realityirrelevant compulsions how you feel now is temporal determining reality with your own faculties is one of the few possessions people really have which is why its so hard for them to give it up in the face of depression when you have so little of yourself already but understand this you are not to be trusted right now the state of your brain renders you unfit to judge the true implications of your present condition any conclusion derived and held fast to about the bleakness of your future should be regarded as dismissively as a medieval doomsayer slicked in filth ranting in his tattered robes about end times and repentance knowing how idve read the above two paragraphs i realize how little i may be able to convince any of you ever messages contrary to roaring horror whilst in depressions throes are met with incredulity with yes yes but this does not apply to me my suffering is special it is not and lending further undue credence to the arguments presented in the court of your mind which are rigged against depressions opposition anyway is a product of being brainwashed by your sorrow and keening misery im sorry you feel those things but fuck you youre wrong and not everythings doomed,pre-pandemic,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

so i made a new account because i dont want to talk about this on my normal reddit account so when i was growing up a friend and i both dudes used to watch softcore porn during sleep overs nothing sexual would happen we would just check out the late night cinemax well one night after a particularly steamy skinamax my friend was asleep and i was still quite awake and horny so since i was pretty sure he was asleep i went to the other side of the room hopped on the computer and fapped to some internet porn afterwards i think i felt pretty weird about fapping in the same room as my sleeping friend but i shrugged it off and went to sleep six years later im in college and doing quite well for myself i have a girlfriend im studying biology and im getting 40s most semesters then one day out of the blue the memory of that night six years ago pops into my headand i cant stop thinking about it i felt like a total pervert or freak or something for masterbating while my friend was in the room i went to some counseling sessions the university offers but it didnt really help the counselor told me it wasnt a big deal and theres no need to freak about it and he suggested calling the friend about it so on a fateful afternoon i give this guy a call and tell him what was bothering me and he freaks out he tells me its a weird phone call and hangs up after that i became super anxious that he was going to tell my friends or that it was going to ruin my life somehow that intense anxiety soon turned into depression ive went on multiple antidepressants to no avail the following year and did talk therapy the year after the talk therapy helped but its still on my mind and it still makes me super anxious the whole story makes me feel like a creep and that i ruined my life any advice for how to deal with these obsessive thoughts about this am i right to think im a creep how the hell do i move on with my life i just want to be happy again edit so getting some feedback has really helped me out i think i just needed some perspective on all of this i blocked this guy on facebook a few months after the phone call i think i just felt really threatened by him and didnt like the idea of him having access to my facebook profilelife now though that seems pretty stupid i feel bad about that i guess i worry that i pissed him off by blocking him on facebook and it would make everything even worse if i ever saw him again that happened a year and a half ago though thoughts,pre-pandemic,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

ive posted a few videos about this topic before people can feel free to disagree and thats fine what i dont agree with is the admins just deleting the posts because they dont like the message so im not going post any videos or links ill ask the readers to answer a few honest questions if you believe that we genuinely like in a toxic patriarchy and being a straight white male gives you more privilege over others then why are men more likely to suffer from depression and suicide than women why are white people in rich first world countries often more sad and depression than people in the developing world if toxic masculinity is such a bad influence on young men than why are kids who grow up without a father or father figure far more likely to become troubled youths drop out of school and become involved in crime at a young age if being more effeminate is considered more progressive and healthy than why are these type of men more likely to suffer from stress and anxiety and unable to handle emergency situations without having a mental breakdown for example they may en emotional breakdown if a job interview doesnt go their way so how can they honestly expect to handle a situation like a road accident if being more effeminate is an ideal trait then why are women always far more often attracted to more masculine men why was something like 50 shades of grey a worldwide best seller among women when it depicts being sexually aggressive and dominating a young woman as positive if being transgender is stunning and brave essentially a man in the literally sense shedding all masculinity and becoming a woman then why are transgender people is far more likely to commit suicide even far more so than the straight white men even after they go through their transformation why is it considered sexist if a female character in a movie or tv show isnt depicted as nothing more over the top i can do anything girl power superduper yet its always perfectly fine to portray men as bumbling idiots whether its a cocky male hero who causes trouble or the sitcom foolish betamale tv dad why is it that i know someone personally who had all of these traits he hated anything heteronormative considered himself a woke male feminist would often come across as being pretentious and make leftwing political debates when if we were just out socialising would consider all religions and older traditions as just for idiots yet fall into nihilism delve into marxist theory and claim to be on the side of the working class yet never worked in manual labour a day in his life nor bother to setup a small business or volunteer came across as being effeminateeven prided himself on it and was open about virtue signalling then complained to other guys about being awkward around women he did all of this and he took his own life can you honestly say that a lack of masculinity isnt causing more problems with men in ireland and around the world this is likely to get banned again and removed if you dont agree thats fine youre free to do so when reading this post ill just ask you to keep an open mind and at least just consider it a possibility,pre-pandemic,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

ive been a jehovahs witness all of my life while i do believe in all of the stuff they teach their rules and expectations are so high i wish i didnt believe this but i think being a jehovahs witness has made me depressed its mainly because you arent supposed to hang out with people who arent jehovahs witnesses although ive broken this rule before it was to hang out with my cousins friends my parents are divorced and im a teenager and i visit my dad who lives in the same small town as my cousin so i hang out with him a lot when i visit twice ive hung out with him and his friends and to be honest they were probably some of the best 2 nights ive had in my life so far because i wasnt being forced to hang out with someone outside of school and it was really the first actual time ive hung out with people that were in my age group that i liked and i know that its pathetic they werent really my friends i didnt know any of them and i had talked to only one of the girls there there and it was through texting i should also mention that my dad isnt a jehovahs witness and had no idea i was doing this since ive always been an outcast because of the restrictions of my religion have no friends outside of school because no one else in my congregation is anything like me because almost every one is very conservative and like most depressed kids i listen to screamo and watch anime so if i let anyone know that they would all think im a freak and probably not even want to look at me i have no social skills because i have dont really talk to anyone outside of school i just come home and try to stay in my room for as much time as i can i constantly fantasize about having a girlfriend not even making out or intercourse just having someone to love and hold who is like me if im not thinking about something my mind drifts into that dark place and every time it does i go a little bit farther in what i fear the most is that ill get stuck there eventually and then ill end it the worst part is that im too afraid to tell anyone the only person ive told is my mom and i lied to her eventually that it was just a phase and that i got over it i always look like im happy even though im far from it the worst thing is that im worried im bipolar i know it sounds stupid but some days im super happy without a care in the world then other days im super sad and ill i can think about is hurting people because im jealous of their happiness other time its not even that im jealous i dont know why but sometimes ill walk past some one and ill think i wonder what it would be like to shove a knife all the way through their head and popping their eyeballs and i hate it im disgusted by it but sometimes and i dont know why i just wonder what it would be like to just shoot someones head off and for some reason whenever i think about it theyre always begging me to stop to please dear god dont kill them but it cut them off mid sentence with a bullet any way sorry for the wall of text but i just really needed some where to vent,pre-pandemic,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0

this girl recently took a liking to me and started texting me over whatsapp up until now i dont know if she likes me or if she is just stringing me along for her own self esteme i have been nothing but nice to this girl asking her how her day was sending her morning text messages of encouragement listening to her petty problems but i just cant seem to let go of her some part of me believes that her and her roommate are just toying with my emotions and another part thinks that she might like me i cant emphasize might enough i never asked her why she started talking to me because i figured it might scare her off cause i would come off as being unfriendly but now i feel horrible because i let her into my life and she can probably get with another guy and forget all about me i barely have any friends and talking to her kinda helped me feel a little better about myself but now i feel like i will never live up to her expectation of what she might want in a guy i feel like she is testing the waters but i dont recall ever not being sweat and encouraging why do girls do this if you like a guy fucking say it stop dragging us along and playing with our emotions,pre-pandemic,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0
ive had depression such a long time and i too feel like its too late to achieve anything meaningful with my life or even become the most basic description of what most people would consider a moderately successful adult im 39 working this grocery store job that literally cannot advance anywhere and it barely covers the bills but it does enough for me to live on my own which im grateful for that is a success i guess but ill be honest as well the job is fucking miserable all day customer service orientated for snobby rich healthobsessed and trendy people being stuck at this job its the best money i can find now literally makes me want to kill myself when i leave a shift there ive got a manager right now who hates me and if you know what constructive discharge means that is what seems to be happening at work so anyway i recently got hurt at work and typing at and using a computer at home like this is about the only thing ive been able to do for about two weeks now to interact with anyone i cant drive very much while hurt like this so it really sucks like i can barely manage to make a trip to the store for some basic shit i need i have to get completely whacked on medication which can be fun if you like it but i dont like it when it is involuntary to try to do anything physical around the house like i had to do this one thing or id get a fine and even then it is just so painful and hard to move it will probably be this way another couple weeks but maybe i can heal faster i dont know it seems like doctors where i am just will not prescribe pain medication anymore because there are too many people abusing it so now i cant get some pain meds when i legit need them which just reminds me of another stupid aspect of our society failing i really dont see much point in my living at all when i am just going through the motions of life but im miserable i can get by financially so far but i dont want to just get by while i feel shitty and useless and unable to advance myself i hate it and there is no point to living this way and theres several billion people living out this same lifestyle right now i dont know how so many people are ok with these pointless lives i guess they are happy enough with that i am not ok with it at all hurting my family is the only reason i am waiting or havent already gone through with it we dont get along so great right now but i would still never want to hurt them in that way i gotta add just to be honest and inclusive that i have anxiety as bad as i have depression its almost agoraphobic like it is actually becoming a fear of leaving my house for the million things that could go wrong being stuck here i am not happy but i guess i am safe i shouldnt have to live like this no one should thanks,pre-pandemic,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1

also posted this in rrelationships but want your guys opinions as the title says ive been with my girlfriend 20f for 4 years and known each other for 7 years we decided very early to use the pill for birth control and it worked fine for several years when i was 18 the birth control failed and she got pregnant despite knowing that i did not want a child she went ahead with the pregnancy however had a miscarriage with this i insisted on changing birth control and we eventually came to the nuvaring which worked for a year before failing in 2016 when she got pregnant for the second time i made it incredibly clear throughout the whole pregnancy that i did not want the baby yet she still went ahead with it i am now living at her parents house feeling trapped with no way out i have resigned myself to living with her and my child and have given up on futher education i have no friends near her house and the only joy i have is going back home once or twice every month to spend time with any friends that i havent lost touch with i love my child but i feel like my entire life was stolen away from me by my girlfriend i want to get out of this situation but i feel like it is too difficult to get out of im forced to smile and act happy for the sake of my child but i am slowly dying inside as much as i love the child im not opposed to being seperated from it to get my life back on the other hand i feel like its easier for me to stay and not change anything despite how unhappy i am i also dont want the burden of child support for a child i had no say in but the main reason i havent done anything yet is wanting to keep the status quo i have no idea what to do throwaway because she knows my reddit account tldr girlfriend had my baby despite me consistently making it clear that i did not want it now i feel trapped and depressed and dont know what to do,pre-pandemic,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

update we are aware this person has been pming everyone whos participated in this thread with claims that we are lying about their actions i hope it goes without saying that were not one of the people who let us know what theyre up to used the phrase persecution complex and the behaviour unfortunately does seem to be consistent with that after warnings and explanations they said they would cooperate then persisted in doing exactly what we told them was against the rules after we resorted to banning the account something we very rarely do here they announced that they were going to escalate their rulebreaking behaviour the sort of person who claims to want to help but ignores a communitys rules while claiming to want to follow them is in our regretful opinion exactly the sort of person that our vulnerable ops need to be protected from if you received any pms as followup to a comment you made on this post please click report on all of them as this brings this persons behaviour to the attention of the reddit admins thanks weve had reports of pming behaviour from a serial religious proselytiser whom weve had to take action against for persistently trying to save people in this sub their favourite tactic appears to be encouraging people to join a church because its a way to find a community this is a notorious evangelical recruitment tactic dont fall for it edit i should have worded that last sentence better were not saying that all religion is notorious or anything were saying that this particular person is being deceptive and manipulative and misrepresenting themselves and their intentions in a way thats representative of the worst types of cultish religion so our issue is fundamentally not with religion but the misuse of it,pre-pandemic,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

dear all those living with depression i want to start by saying that i am no expert and that all of the information below is purely based on my experience and opinion regardless i hope that this post helps a famous ancient chinese man yeah seems random i know names lao tzu once said if you are depressed you are living in the past if youre anxious you are living in the future if youre content then youre living in the present step 1 realise that the past is the past you cant help what has happened you must try to move on but also in the process of moving on from whatever awful experiences youve had dont worry about the future or youll land right back where you started so thats two part of the quote the next part is living in the present i want you right now to come up with as many things that youre thankful for having in your head right now thinking about what you already have and appreciate havingare privileged with having gets you on your feet but its the first of many steps to finding your happiness x200b step 2 whats your passion everybody has a drive and a passion its what inspires us everyday who we see ourselves as as a result of this you need to have moved on to continue these steps i want you to focus on your drive what gets you up in the morning even though you tell yourself its just gonna be another shit day focus on it and make some goals as stepping stones derived from your passion this is the beginning of your path to happiness strive to accomplish these goals if you dont want to achieve them then theyre not really associated with your passion this is probably the hardest part of the system outside of moving on to immediately pinpoint what we all really want can be really tough even if it takes you a few days of thought to do it youre on track with your passion as your drive and your goals set push to the finish line now this is tricky some days it will be hard guaranteed and eventually that drive may fade as a result of sinking back into old habits so i want you to set aside a little money each week or month and pin down a date on that date i want you to treat yourself a little even if its just grabbing a chocolate thick shake from mcdonalds down the road the feeling of rewarding yourself should just be the sparkkick you need to keep on moving x200b step 3 the infinite step sounds daunting yeah well this step is just well life youre on your way i cant help any more from here the infinite step is purely just adopting healthy practises to help you not to go back to the state you were at the start of these steps tip 1 every night when you go to bed instead of worrying like many others go again through your head everything that you are thankful for take deep breaths between each one x200b tip 2 try not to associate yourself with negative people by this i mean people who bring you down make you feel like you were at the start this might even mean cutting off connection with a friend even just for a little while i dont mean disassociate yourself from others in your position once you complete these steps as a former sufferer of depression you can really make a connection with those who are in similar positions you can empathise more with them than others can and you can help if you choose to bring many people out of the holes that they have dug for themselves x200b tip 3 pass this on to someone else you know is suffering with depression x200b i do not know if this helps at all i can just hope please feel free to ask any questions in comments good luck for all your futures x200b,pre-pandemic,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

i have always been so passive with my mental health experts whatever advice they tell or oversimplification they make about my problems i just go with it because the last thing i need in my life is another place to have negative social interactions and walk out more depressed so afraid to tell them they are completely wrong and i listen to so much of the bullshit they tell me that it seems i am the one who should be paid for patiently hearing x200b however i smoked just a small little puff before my appointment and it made a big difference i confronted her with whatever i felt was a wrong judgement and now my confidence really made her unable to avoid my inqueries i was also so much more sincere and direct i used to sugarcoat my problems because otherwise the realization of how bad things were in my life brought me to the point of tears on spot no more oversensitivity or anxiety i came to the conclusion that having some friction with other people is completely normal and even necesary so they learn to have a high standard of you and not someone you can easily manipulate due to their low selfesteem x200b just a little detail at the end i stared at her similing for a good amount of time on one of those awkward silences she suddenly brought up that she was married and explained an experience with her husband to show me an example of applying cbt nice inuendo doc but that thc just makes me laugh it off x200b note attempt it with very small dosages cause otherwise your train of thought will get fucked i think there is a sweet spot to boost morale without clogging the thought process,pre-pandemic,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1

im a sophomore in college right now and i am constantly surrounded by wise people people who did things with their lives in high school and didnt waste it away crying starving themselves neglecting their work they were able to partake in extracurriculars in spite of nervousness or not being nervous at all they were able to accomplish things efficiently without attention or memory issues they were able to make friends without poor social cues i had friends who manipulated me and threatened to commit suicide everyday and even then i never had positive influences to help me my parents were so busy with work that since my youth i was always alone at home i have trouble having fun i cant emotionally feel like a happy person its always forced it doesnt come naturally to me so people didnt like people like me im too lazy to write this but basically i feel so bitter i wish i did more so i could show off my potential but nope i wasnt certain of myself ever im trying to improve but my past latches onto me sigh edit i have something to add first i am very happy to see that some people can relate to at least the topic sentence of this post we all feel like we were taken back by years because of some shitty stuff in my past i also didnt get to finish writing this because i hadnt the energy to finish but there were moments where i stopped eating showering and brushing my teeth for very long periods of time i also hid my feelings all the time when people used to say you dont understand it would hurt so much because i really did in some way or so i thought i had speech therapy in middle school and general therapy in high school but i was never very honest because i was always afraid of the consequences i feel a little bit of pride i guess saying this but i feel like im an example of someone who hid all their feelings and just wants it all like all vomited and shat and sweated and cried out of me until i can remove it completely nowadays i struggle to even read sometimes i just dont have the strength but i try i do say though writing this was therapeutic because i am severely overwhelmed saying this but thanks for reading,pre-pandemic,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0

ive been feeling really depressed and lonely lately from my job im a full time late night janitor for a courthouse just 10 miles away from my hometown working there has been pretty easy but i wound up feeling super lonely a lot considering i dont really get to talk to my friends or hang out with them much so just today i came home late as usual and i have a little interaction with my mom after she made a joke to me that i took pretty personal and felts like was more of an insult rather than a sense of humor i told her that i didnt really want to joke around like that but she refused to listen and told me to just go away then despite attempting to change the topic and explain why i havent been feeling so high all she kept doing was telling what a great mom she is for raising me and my brother while struggling to make ends meet and keep the house what an ungrateful little bastard i am for not appreciating her hard work and sacrifices at that moment i was legitimately about to begin to cry but rather instead of pausing and trying to reverse the damages all my mom did was host a little parental style of the oppression olympics and proclaim her amount of tears and cries over the course of three weeks i got out just before my first tear would legitimately run down my cheek and even before i went to bed she goes on about how her life is more worse than ours then escalates into a more this is why youd make a terrible mistake getting behind the wheel considering i had practice driving this morning unaware that she had just lite the fuse to trigger the firework but she didnt seem to care thanks for reading i hope you feel better soon and find the key to unlocking your next set of happiness along with having a parent who doesnt make your suffering all about them and why you shouldnt be depressed,pre-pandemic,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0

im going to be a bit harsh here because i see this expressed so often around here but a lot of you complain about never finding someone who likes you yet as more info comes out it becomes clear that you dont like any of the people who like you because theyre ugly or whatever so why do you think youre entitled to the decent beautiful people not to say you dont deserve someone youre attracted to but a lot of people here want someone usually someone who is well above average in the looks department ignoring all the people who do like you because they are just average or maybe a bit overweight or arent tall enough or has an ugly hairstyle or whatever and then say ugh no one likes me and i cant get a relationshipor get a fwb or whatever i mean seriously do you not see anything hilarious about that someone does like you you just dont like them and how do you think that feels to them probably the same way youre feeling right now but at least they tried and let their feelings be known unlike someone of you that get upset because the cashier at the grocery store only talks to you when you buy something and you hate that she just wont notice youre deeply in love with her looks because if youve barely spoken to her you know nothing about her i know a lot of us get blind to others feelings when youre depressed but look outside yourself sometimes you are not entitled to a beauty queen just because you like them then you seem incredibly focused on getting a relationship and having sex those are wonderful things but shouldnt be your focus the best advice someone ever gave me was to look at everyone as a friend first if something develops thats just icing on the cake otherwise youve made a friend and thats just as important too many of you are too focused on only getting to know someone if you want to have sex with them then wonder why you dont have friends and cant find love its ridiculous,pre-pandemic,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1

i dont know if these are just symptoms of depression but i feel so distant from people that i used to consider friends they never come in contact with me and i cant bring myself to contact them either and when i do its often just short lived conversations or i end up being left on read my main circle of friends kind of broke off and now they never seem to plan anything with me i feel so alone but at the same time it feels so hard to talk to people or even get out and try to meet others as for finding new friendships and relationships i feel like ive met someone but i find it so hard to trust them and i feel so scared all the time that its never going to work out or if theyre even interested i honestly feel like im not even a priority for them but i feel so guilty and selfabsorbed for feeling this way i dont know if i should tell them because it might make me feel clingy i dont know what to do and i feel hopeless edit thank you for gold hopefully our shared experiences can help our fellow brothers sisters and siblings get through these hard times,pre-pandemic,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1

i should start this by stating i no longer get such a feeling anymore i always dissuaded depression as some false grab for attention boy was i wrong this overwhelming feeling of getting nothing done doing nothing and just wasting time had made me feel incredibly impotent i had even cried at one point which is something i hadnt done for years at that point and i pride myself as the fairly happypositive type it just felt like everything once comfortable was a waste of time and only worsened my mood showers felt long and drawn out making me drowsy i had stayed in my bed looking at my ceiling for hours but it seemed like minutes it came to the point where i tried to watch movies i had associated with happy golucky and even those didnt help in the slightest it felt forced almost contrived like an effort gone to waste or a carcrash in slow motion almost a feeling of self cringe i cannot offer any advice or help to anyone with depression only that i was fortunate enough that the feeling eventually disappeared i merely state this to anyone who has never felt it before it can happen to anyone and chances are if someone you know says theyre depressed they are most likely feeling the shittiest they have ever been and its best that you support them as best as you can sometimes it gets better like in my case sometimes it can last years i only hope those who are tolled with that kind of feeling have something worth living for,pre-pandemic,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1

it was tense i talked him through some dark stuff he showed empathy like no other and i immediately felt like i already knew him and vice versa at the end of the session he asked for my id for administrative purposes when he saw my date of birth and realized it was my birthday he cracked up and through his chuckles he demanded who the hell sets up an appointment on his birthday of course i couldnt care less if it was my birthday i tend to forget my own age however his laugh was so genuine and from such a good heart that at last i recognized the ridiculousness and joined his laughter it was the first time i felt 100 comfortable with another person in the same room i couldnt have asked for a better present edit i cant thank you all enough for the wishes and positivity ive been an active rdepression dweller for the past few months and ive never been let down recovery or not this community will always have a special place in my heart the bond that links your true family is not one of blood but of respect and joy in each others life i know its far fetched but it applies for me today,pre-pandemic,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

cognitive behavioral therapy just in case youre not familiar second session today im big into psychology anyway even if im really down low theres neat stuff on the internet to take my mind off it and learn about my mind and how it works or doesnt but yeah ive been in a lull for years maybe over a decade ive got a really harsh inner critic that negative voice and left unchecked it just makes things worse dwelling on stuff that doesnt really matter or that i could find out or verify with a phone call but i dont because reasons on the other hand the critic helps when i need to learn and understand stuff its like a devils advocate when im engaged in a topic i really get a thorough understanding with the critical voice but thats got little to do with cbt thats more internal family systems but cbt is the life hack to counter the rampaging critic til things are going to be ok not something id say to myself previously and you know what today turned out ok story til that the registration on my car was expired since last month i found this out when i was getting in my car to head to the therapists office the apartment i dunno groundskeeping or parking enforcement or whomever stuck a sticker on the drivers window saying something like first warning your plates expired fix it or you get towed i did what any person in my situation would do check the plate cause i swore it was good for another year nope ok did somebody nab my sticker check the registration no its expired shit ive been driving around with expired tags for a month oblivious with no problems so i headed to therapy sitting white knuckle in the waiting room cause im thinking my car will get towed in the parking lot which is silly but i guess it could happen at least i thought so ill save you the whole session but needless to say things will be ok i headed out the nearest dmv the therapist was quite helpful in getting directions it was raining something mad and im not tootoo sure what im looking for and theres heavy enough traffic that i cant lollygag but not so heavy that im stationary half the time and would only miss it if i were blind i take surface streets home cause i bet money there would be a wreck on the highway still very much intending to renew my registration but it seemed like the deck was stacked against me things are going to be ok ok i make it home with no police behind me and i keep checking outside to make sure my cars not getting towed while i do a quick google to see what ill need for a long expired plate i dont have uptodate insurance either fuck not in my car or my apartment ok maybe the new packet or a bill is in my pobox a few miles away get back into my car which is still not towed small victories and head to the post office still raining traffic is slow and heavy hydroplane here hydroplane there i think my rear shocks are breaking get to the post office open my box nothing from my insurance company but a magazine i need proof of insurance i must do i even have insurance anymore get back into my car and flip through the magazine seeing if theres a support number no there isnt youre doomed is it in your phone no its not youre totally boned relax in my seat take a few deep breaths watch a police car roll slowly down the road in the rest of congestion changing posturebehavior is also cbt i wonder if my expired insurance information has the number check glove box and we have a number right on the first page and a separate one for incidents dial it up things are looking up automated prompt yes its voice enabled too so just a few voice commands and it turns out im still insured and theyve sent me an email that says yes you are insured great but its getting later and i only have an hour before i think the dmv closes i still dont know when it closes drive over to the college where im an alum so i can print the email cause who owns a printer anymore dont have my college id do i get it from home or hope the receptionist is nice lets bet on good yes she is and its a few minutes of messing about to get into the computer lab but im in rock on fuck yes making progress some of my friends are there but im rather distracted get the email up to print it wont print the connected printer is disconnected if that makes sense im in a queue i take a look at what printer its trying to send to its on another floor of the building it shouldnt be printing there its not anyway but thats beside the point ok its ok lets check the printer in this room seems ok its on and waiting ill restart it turned back on just fine its not the default thats still the one on the other floor and its not showing one with the room number like it should check all printers the computer can access pick random or the one that looks most like a printer and least like a document writer press print and just a few feet away the printer spins up with my document boss but now its half hour til i expect the place the close and im still driving around with an expired tag in heavy traffic in the rain its rush hour now nearest dmv is a few miles away sit in traffic roll along stop smoke a cigarette roll roll roll stop roll stop roll stop roll just goes on like that time ticking away i get to the dmv with about 15 minutes left i think walk in a few people sitting in the waiting chairs a couple of booths with folks standing at them i talk to the receptionist she asks what im here for and all i say is renew registration i get a number and sit down things are going to be ok but probably expensive my number is called wow that was quick i barely got to sit down the booth right in front of where i sat too wow i had the clerk my number and they ask what im there for i say renew registration and the clerk asks do you have your old one i fumble in my pockets but i did bring it im expecting something about being a month late and some fees nothing the clerk rings it up prints off a new card and sticker and says thatll be x x being much less than i paid to license the car in the first place i happen to have x dollars in my pocket and hand the bills over i was so excited i wanted to grab the registration and leave right there i paused and waited for change i didnt even need proof of insurance things are going to be ok hooray,pre-pandemic,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

hey everyone ive suffered from depression since januaryfebruary of this year ive healed considerably since then but i still have thoughts of suicide my depression was triggered by many personal factors but one of the largest was that my girlfriend broke up with me and got together with my best friend since elementary school she recently wanted to get back together and i stupidly fell for it no less than a week into the new relationship she said she didnt have any feelings for me she said she had many failed relationships and would like to pursue the other gender because that is what shes most attracted to i was crushed and also frustrated why did i let myself continue with the cat and mouse game anyways i just want to guys to know that since i still go to school with these people i see them often and when i see them i make it a point to fake my happiness i do this so i can get some schadenfreude from them knowing they cant bring me down but it also makes me feel better in the process so if youre feeling bad just try to fake being happy and you can trick your mind into thinking youre actually happy thanks for reading and have a great day,pre-pandemic,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0

nobody faces the same challenges when battling depression some have it harder than others while some goes through an equally difficult period but with different elements to why it is difficult i have found a phrase that helps me through the day through those dark periods when all i can do is to feel sorry for myself this phrase is the world doesnt owe you anything most of us knows that in the animal kingdom every animal goes through a brutal life dominated by chance and luck the world doesnt owe a lion a long life just as it doesnt owe a gazelle a long life most of us understand this but fail to apply this logic to our own life the world doesnt owe us anything we are not entitled to love from family or friends we are not entitled to the bed we sleep in these are blessings and shouldnt be taken for granted a recent example from my own life that send my spiraling down into a depressed phase i was at a party and as usual i was anxious about not being funny or interesting so i get uptight and nervous this is normal for me so i expect this to happen what i feared was gonna happen though happened i was chatting to a buddy and a drunk girl comes over i get uncomfortable and dont make much of myself another one comes over to the three of us and says whats up the drunk girl comments how my buddy is playing serious and that im actually 100 serious and that she is trying to think of fun things to say becausse were so boring yes that was an incredibly rude thing to do yes you shouldnt care what other people say but thats not how we really work so the comment from this girl triggers bad memories from all the time ive been called boring serious and uninteresting and there are a lot of those ill tell ya this statement put me in a bad state so i didnt enjoy the rest of the night what i shouldve done was to think im not entitled to feel funny and interesting i shouldnt feel like a victim because this girl or others dont enjoy my company im not entitled to that the universe doesnt work that way why should i feel sorry for myself feel bad feel worthless just because an interaction didnt go the way i wanted it to no i perhaps others should stop feeling sorry for themselves were not entitled to anything we gotta be grateful for every positive moments we have because theres no reason that we deserve or are entitled to those feeling that the world owes us makes it easier for us to feel like victims to feel sad to feel sorry for ourselves so this was a rally to all those who easily feel sorry for themselves like i do try to shift your perspective a tad and i hope that will help you hope this didnt offend anyone depression is as i said different from person to person and i shouldnt tell you how to feel or deal with that experience i also know that being called boring is a miniscule problem compared to people who are victims of molestation or other much more seriously damaging experiences than going to a bad party like i did this weekend much love,pre-pandemic,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

for the longest time ive been trying to understand how people can be depressed maybe its simply because any and all depressed people ive seen are people who claim to be depressed for the shallowest reasons imaginable but ive never really believed that people can be depressed my reasoning is something like this if youre reading this chances are you live better than 70 of the world so how can a person claim to be depressed you sure as hell have it better than about four billion others when you look at the majority of depression cases do you think theyve been in a situation where life is absolutely miserable where they dont have food or where violence is their life where disease runs rampant or any really lifethreatening situation where they realize that your life is god awful i just really dont understand how people can claim that their life is worse than anyone elses i spoke with someone earlier about the violence aspect and they pointed out a situation where violent rape occurred and because no one in the victims life could relate the pentup emotions became depression and sadness what i didnt understand is why cant someone channel those emotions elsewhere to something productive like becoming strong enough to prevent it from ever happening again tldr im probably coming off as an asshole but i dont understand how people can get depressed and i just would like to hear some scientific reasoning behind depression,pre-pandemic,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0

it just seems so strange to me that most people dont spend every waking moment hating themselves and thinking about death like while theyre waiting for the train what do they think about if not jumping on the tracks and ending it right there or seeing a building and wondering if the impact of jumping from it will be enough to kill them do they just look at a tree with strong branches and think what a nice tree that is instead of which branch would be best to hang myself from how is it possible that some people just dont want to die not to mention so many people who go through painful and expensive treatments just to stay alive it makes me feel so guilty for all the times ive wished to get cancer so i can die without having to do anything i wish i could donate my physical health to someone who needs it so i can just let my sick brain shrivel up and die,pre-pandemic,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0

dear depressed redditors i wanted to share my story of my fall into a black hole of depression my struggle to find good treatment and then the ultrahigh speed2 week recovery i experienced i hope this story gives some hope to those that are struggling that getting better doesnt need to take months or years happy to answer any questions as well in college i was a fairly happy person however my senior year i had a personal crisis and fell into a dark hole of depression there were days i didnt want to get out of bed and pretty soon days turned into weeks i was struggling to complete my classes and ended up taking a leave of absence from stanford where i was enrolled i was in this horrible place for a few months during this time i tried all kinds of treatments to get better i tried antidepressants exercise 2 different talk therapists long conversations with friends trips to see family and many other things i was diligently searching for effective help but nothing i tried was very helpful and after months of searching i wasnt any better off than i was at the start of my exploration of mental health services finally by complete good luck i was referred to matthew may a psychiatrist on the adjunct faculty at stanford who was practicing a new cutting edge form of therapy called team therapy i went to see matt and in just a few weeks doing twice a week two hour sessions my depression vanished i felt completely better and in fact was able to experience loads of joy and happiness i can imagine this might strike many people as too good to be true and honestly i was in a state of disbelief myself having been cured so quickly of a problem that i had struggled with for months this new therapy is super awesome and i feel lucky i chanced into finding it but its not widely known ask me any questions note for those interested in an app for this new therapy after i enrolled back in school i reached out to the creator of this new team therapy who is a fairly well known psychiatrist named david burns dr burn is an adjunct emeritus professor of psychiatry at stanford and is well known in therapy circles for his bestselling book feeling good which was published in the 1970s and popularized cognitive behavioral therapycbt i was curious if he was interested in creating digital selfhelp tools leveraging the team model but for a variety of reasons the time wasnt right after spending 10 years as an engineer and product manager i reconnected with david and weve decided to build a new selfhelp app using the team model the model has become even more refined and powerful and the results are often astounding there are many examples now of people recovering from their depression in just a few hours of live therapy on davids podcast we are hoping our app can be an awesome new tool for people struggling with depression we are looking for beta testers if you are interested you can sign up here,pre-pandemic,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

edit my use of triggering in the title refers to how i felt reading articles and comments regarding robin williams on the night of not the anger i felt the next day after having time to think and refresh it angers me to see posts saying if only robin williams knew how many people cared loved him are sad now in my bouts with depression i wouldnt have cared if 7 billion people sent cards saying they care or 10 page letters or a 16hour phone call id still throw the cards or letters away or hang up the phone and think they dont really care they just dont want my death on their conscience id bet money robin williams was the same way who could be more loved than a funnyman when someone tells me in the context of suicide id be sad if you died i think great so i should endure my pain every day because you dont want to feel pain yourself i think how selfish how is it more selfish to desire an end to my pain than it is want me to remain in pain its easy for the other person to ask me to remain in pain they dont feel it they dont see it because if i show it hey perk up be happy turn that frown upside down depression isnt an on off switch and so i never want someone to do something they dont want to do i can remember one time that all i wanted was to play a particular board game with a friend but i couldnt bring myself to say that i didnt want my friend to play just because i asked or out of some moral obligation and i know that if i did at the end id hear do you feel better as if they were just going through a undesirable task to make me less sad instead i just sat there and said and did nothing for the rest of the evening watching my friend get frustrated and angry with me the robin williams posts are triggering because they are filled with ignorant comments about caring if i die millions will never know much less billions much less care as one rself post proclaims friends and family will move on because their advice to me is always keep putting one foot in front of the other just let go of that bad stuff obligatory edit thanks for the gold kind stranger its my first,pre-pandemic,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,1

since i was born i always dreamt about having a role model having a masculine figure that would teach me how be a man able to face any kind of trouble in life to be a man strong enough to be assertive and confident no matter what sadly that dream never came true im indeed a product of a single motherhood as far as my biological dad is concerned he has never really been around and did very little if not nothing as a dad he finally passed away a couple of years ago his family dont want have anything to do with me according to them im a failurethe only man having been present in my life was the one my mother married to 17 years ago im still amazed how fast she married him they got married 4 months after they met ive been psychologically and physically abused told time and time again i was an accident my mother didnt do anything to stop that and used to take his side the reason being she was desperate and didnt want her reputation to be undermined they got divorced in 2014 today im 24 years old and though having a degree im unemployed i got no friend let alone girlfriend i got no kids either ive never been good at making friends becoming entrepreneur is therefore the first idea that went through my mind as a loner i wanna work for nobody but myself however even though im ambitious deep down i feel empty i feel weak i even noticed ive been sort of feminized over the years and it pains me just how hard it is to not be able to embrace my masculinity whenever i talk to people mostly women whenever i open my mouth i got this insecurity that takes over me which affects the way i talk as well as my body language im working on all that to work my situation out but i aint gonna lie to you its tough pretty much when a male figure has never been there to guide me no wonder why most criminals come from single motherhood the amount of anger is such they end up killing people like you know this society is casting fathers aside by giving women full custody and we all know where this leads crimes poverty and even suicides someday i wanna write a book about that in order to let people know how meaningful it is for a child to have a father in his life one more thing a mom wont ever be able to raise a boy on her own let alone able to make him a man,pre-pandemic,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1

my lifes an absolute mess right now 5050 split between crippling depression and some of the worst decisions possible post describing recent events post describing my emotional state as of a week and a half ago post describing the relationship i was in take this with a grain of salt idont really know where to start i guess ill just go with a stream of consciousness and try to make it readable ive been living with my parents for about two weeks now before that i was living with my now ex fiance in short i dropped out of college lied to everyone about it cheated on my fiance with a hooker and then watched everything blow up when she found out since then ive been to all sorts of therapy and on more than my fair share of medication first i was diagnosed with major depressive disorder with a side of generalized anxiety then it was type ii bipolar disorder again with generalized anxiety now the doctors back to wavering not knowing what the hell is wrong with me but knowing there is something wrong is terrifying ive had a few panic attacks over this my parents are angry with me i really really dont blame them i dont think theyre going to throw me out buti just dont know how to handle this part of me wants to just cut ties with everyone around me until i can get my head sorted out but i literally cant afford to do that my mask is back on whenever anyones around im if not smiling at least personable i hate seeing the worried looks the upset the confusion i dont like making people feel like that so i do my best to not look depressed im really really good at it i can be almost charismatic when i want to be thisscares me im really good at pretending to be me but a better me im good at being manipulative really fucking good i have to constantly fight the urge to push the bright red buttons i see in other peoples heads itthis urge isnt to fuck with them i want the people around me to be happy i want them to like me i dont want anything else from them i dont ask anything else of them i just want everyone to be happy and sometimes its the easiest thing in the world to make them that way its part of my mask it was like that with my fiance its like that with my parents its like that with my friends its like that with my therapist it is so fucking hard to not just say what they want to hear to make them happy im already doing that with my friends again its hard to be 100 honest with my therapist i dont talk to my parents about anything serious at all because i cant stand manipulating them into being happy and i cant stand seeing them upset sometimes i feel like the fact that i genuinely care about other people is the only thing that separates me from being a psychopath im worried that im genuinely loosing my marbles and that that empathy is going to go someday imall sorts of fucked up from the relationship i was in my therapist was pushing that it was a few steps shy of emotionally abusive for a bit and has backed off of that right now i think the biggest problem was that we didnt communicate well she didnt express her feelings of upset in an argument very well and i got too anxious over everything to be able to express mine very well i think we genuinely cared for each other were in love with each other and that there was no maliciousness or selfishness at play butit was not a healthy relationship the worst part is that i feel like i should miss it and i dont i have such a hard time feeling anything the last strong feeling i had other than panic attacks was when i was cleaning my stuff out of our apartment there were assorted gifts shed given me over the years and looking at themi genuinely hated myself burning hatred i broke them as best i could because i didnt deserve a single fucking token of her affection i want to talk to her i want to tell her that none of what happened is her fault i wanti want to make her happy again and i cant fucking do that she doesnt want to talk to me and i dont blame her i will not be the first one to reach out because that is not my place its going to be on her terms i dont know what scares me more that she might not forgive me or that she might i sure as fuck dont deserve to be forgiven it also scares me that she might want to try again im not sure i could tell her no if she asks theres justi did too good a job of destroying our relationship she cant ever trust me again i cant feel happy with myself again she deserves better iti just hope that if the time comes i have the fucking backbone to say no i feelso fucking empty externally i look fine ive been working out im in shape for the first time in a while i make sure to shower and shave and pay attention to what i wear i smile i crack jokes i hang out with friends ive already got a job lined up i say everything everyone expects of me the only thing i havent done in a while is look someone in the eyes i cant fucking do it im afraid that when i do theyll see just how fucking empty i am and i dont want that ive always been so damn good at pretending to be me that it scares me that its finally slipping the worst part is that i know that if i were okay how im acting now would be how i would be acting butid actually feel it i hate that im missing all of these things i hate that i missed the feeling of being in love for so long i hate that when i was sitting on the couch with my fiance looking at wedding

im not really expecting sympathy as i know what i did was wrong note this is going to be long lol so basically ive been seeing this guy online for three months now and we instantly hit it off we were texting each other constantly everyday but little did he know that i was actually a catfish who posed as a pretty cute person who was just camera shy this was my first time catfishing and instantly after a day of doing it i deleted my account from the dating site but kept in contact with him without telling him who i was now this relationship lasted through november and december which were both of our exam months which gave me the perfect excuse to why i couldnt meet him since we both live in the same area he was the perfect guy to me we shared stories our feelings and talked about what we did on that day he was everything that i wanted to be he was sporty popular and talented what made me fall for him though was that he was so supportive during my exams were he would actually take his time for a couple hours and tutor me over time i just stopped sending him photos and he didnt care he thought i was just shy but in reality my guilt was just building up i wanted to tell him badly but before i did i sought help on subreddits such as ramiugly and others to get a sense of how i looked obviously this was a major mistake on my part and resulted in a major blow in my confidence levels i was a wreak and still am i told him i was a catfish 3 days ago and to my surprise he took it really well and forgave me really well he actually complimented me on how i was such a good catfish to my surprise he confessed that he also catfishes other people but instead he catfishes people for fun this was going great until he confessed that he had a boyfriend all a long and he was pretty promiscuous but this thought never would have crossed my mind i showed him my real photos and he rated me a a 5510 i was completely average to him i was not too bad he wanted to remain friends and so i did the consequences honestly i think ive been let off easier than most people but a part of me wishes he just totally broke ties with me this was my first relationship that felt meaningful with a person looking at his pictures kills me inside and i havent talked to him for 2 days now i feel empty and alone the nightly ritual that we once had of talking from 11 pm to 4 am was gone i dont know what to do this catfishing scheme only resulted in many many insecurities i think ive fallen into depression i feel lonely jealous of his life ugly inadequate on top of this is other things like my joblessness i find myself comparing my life with his he was everything i wanted to be im not sure if i should even still talk to him i find myself thinking about him every minute of my day i know i can never compete with his boyfriend he is un reachable now this will be my first and last time catfishing im not sure if this is the effects of losing a friend having my first breakup being called extremely average or both thanks for reading my rant if youre still here lol if youre the one i catfished sorry again i really wish to talk like we used to this is a horrible way to celebrate the new year a part of me wishes that i had confessed after my christmas break to remain happy just a little longer ps for those who are confused im a guy too tldr i catfished another guy fell in love after he supported me for so long i confessed found out he had a boyfriend all a long and that he thinks im average af im depressed now after my first breakup because i miss him and never can get him,pre-pandemic,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

my slob sister is 23 nearly seven years older than me she was homeschooled but shes a legal adult and can do whatever the heck she wants with her life yet she chooses not to instead she went to a community college a few states away for a year when she was nineteen then came back home and proceeded to do nothing with her life instead she literally sits on the computer in her room all day and only comes out to go on her computer more or eat then she complains about her half hour of online schoolwork which apparently makes her unable to do some of her chores then theres me i try to do everything right i get straight as in school participate in cheer and dance do chores everyday use youtuberlevel skin routines every morning spend all my money on clothes and makeup and go to the beach just so i can tan while my sister is basically the definition of a college aged kid with no life no skin routine no makeup never goes outside and has clothes that look like they could be found in the mens department yet i have no friends and none of my parents friends ever care about what im doing with my life just because im still in high school instead they ask me about what my sister is doing with her life when shes doing nothing everything is all about my lazy sister even though she doesnt even bother to get a job what i really dont understand is how i have to do the exact same amount of household chores when she does nothing with her life and i am constantly stressing about everything i need to get done plus im seven years younger the chores thing is really what my sister is 23 so why does she get to do nothing sorry had to get that off my chest i dont mean to sound like a brat but sometimes i just need to vent a little,pre-pandemic,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1
oftentimes depression feels like the mind trying to untangle a complicated knot in itself and putting the rest of life in pause to do that if the society didnt keep bumping its elbows with expectations if it was freed from the normal obligations regarding money social interactions etc the mind could work on the knot much better and the depression can turn out to actually be helpful to the person i think the mental hibernation is turned into a torturous depression only because of our poor understanding of it if in the future we made a society where a depressed person was given basic needs and left to themselves without stigma without social expectations and such the whole of society would benefit enormously from such folks im talking rbasicincome type dream society far in the future and perhaps just idealistic ive talked to a few other people suffering from depression who felt the same way that its not necessarily a disorder by itself but rather a state of mind that needs to be managed differently from the normal state and which can be beneficial to the person in the long run depression is a strange beast that takes different shapes in everyone though so how true does this sound in your own case,pre-pandemic,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

decided to post this as i believe you all deserve to get better this can help you if you put in the effort no matter how hard it gets little background lost my dad grandpa and uncle all in 3 months turned to alcohol to feel better started isolating myself cut everyone off even family didnt leave the house dropped out of college and wanted to kill myself as life wasnt worth living for me anymore at the time got stuck in a dark hole of suicidal thoughts substance abuse rage and severe social anxiety how i got better first things first the alcohol had to go any substance including caffeine weed and cigarettes have to go i quit caffeine and alcohol cold turkey do not recommend tapering down is easier and has a higher rate of success however i was kinda still am an all or nothing person i was either gonna give 110 or kill myself when i grew the balls to do so decided to try one last time to get better i signed up at my local gym now you dont have to go 4 times a week but id recommend a minimum of 3 times a week lifting cardio lift for 45 minutes do cardio for 45 minutes for me personally cardio helps the most i hated it but started to love it after i found out how it made me feel i love lifting so that was the easy part i followed an upperbodylowerbody split 4 times a week made it myself with great results bodyfat went from 17 to 10 in those 6 months was cutting calories on a small deficit if you are overweight make that your number 1 priority lose the excess weight you have no excuse not to most importantly just move walking riding your bike swimming it doesnt matter humans are designed to move selfcare take care of your facial body hair get a fresh haircut as often as you need get rid of old baggy clothes who dont do you any good get a nice deodorant shampoo and bodywash brush your teeth morning and night cut your nails both hands and feet learn how to pluck your eyebrows mostly the area between your two eyebrows dont touch the rest pluck your nosehairs just take care of yourself man look your best i know its hard and you dont want to do it but still force yourself in my head i felt like i wanted to do all of this but it was still extremely hard to actually do it but when i did it i felt better about myself workget a job if you dont have one get a job any kind of job that forces you to get out there and communicate with other people it will be hard at first you might want to cry and just not go whats the point but you have to make yourself do it family reach out to familymembers who 1 you know love you 2 who have always been there for you 3 who have never judged you no matter how bad you were talk to them about anything get out of your head and put it out there it is a relieve the same applies to friends reach out to friends who you know will support you sleep schedule sleep before midnight wake up before 10 am and get out of bed this is crucial force yourself to get out of your bed take a walk shower drink a cup of coffee with a familymember it doesnt matter what you do just get out of your bed and out of your room diet 1 word keto amazing first week maybe 2 are a little hard but after that you feel great your energy levels are stable you feel more motivated to do things and youll lose weight if you track your calories and eat in a deficit hobbys find something you love and start doing it for me it was fitness i loved it and started spending 2 hours at the gym 4 times a week also walked my dogs a lot started reading and played videogames with my brother most importantly remember that you only get once chance at life you can decide to dwell in self pity and live the rest of your life feeling like shit goodluck if thats what you are gonna do because life is long might as well try and make it a fun experience it wont be easy but it will be worth it being happy is worth it you just have to decide if you want to do everything in your power to feel happy again remember that you wake up every single day deciding either to hate yourself and not do anything about it or hate yourself but working on a better you it will pay off in the end you just gotta have the balls to do it and not everyone can be strong live for yourself stop feeling sorry for yourself and start doing something break that mental barrier,pre-pandemic,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0

yeah ill just admit it right now ive never been in a relationship im not some angsty virgin with rage i just dont feel like relationships are as enjoyable as people consider them to be if youre feeling empty youll blame it on not having a girlfriend because all of your friends have them and everyone in movies has them dont try to date every thot that looks at you while youre at starbucks wait to see someone that you could actually imagine a relationship with and make some moves you dont need to be a super alpha male who uses axe body spray to ask someone out no one is gonna judge you if you get rejected relationships arent as satisfying as you think friends are just as good and you dont need the chemical satisfaction of kissing or sex to be happy girls arent magic youll still feel empty even with a girlfriend do what feels right not what your friends or society makes you think is normal you know whats best for you dont give into the pressure of needing a girlfriend just wait until you see someone you actually have a chance with comes along there is a difference between a girlfriend you got for the sake of having a girlfriend and someone you actually like as a person no one is going to read this p,pre-pandemic,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1
im 15 and i feel this sort of weight on my heart and i cant understand it i have an ok number of friends and i do get invited to things like parties well i started getting invited this year since i started being more myself and stopped hanging out with some people that were bringing me down but i feel like everyone thinks of me as a clown i always feel like i want to reach an emotion but i just cant seem to grasp it unless im laughing with a really good friend i thought of killing myself a few times but i would never actually do it because it would bring too much harm on my parents and theyve been having money problems this year i dont have anyone to talk to since out of all my friends i dont really trust any of them except for one who is moving at the end of the year and my parents are so religious they would probably just pull out something about me not praying a lot or whatever my only friend ive talked to about this has been telling me that not everyone sees me as a clown but thats how i feel and i just want to reinvent myself i cant wait to go to college but i dont want to fuck up hs but i cant seem to concentrate on anything because of this shitty feeling inside me i usually get good grades but this year has been average in terms of grades because of this i sometimes get panic attacks where my heart starts rushing and i get trouble breathing ive been feeling this way since last summer ive never had a gf in the past but im not sure if that helps anything please help me just get by this 2 years of hs i have left i go to a french school and im in my 10th year out 12 i know i sound like a whinny idiot and there isnt really a problem but i just want to know how to get rid of this shitty feeling i have inside me thanks,pre-pandemic,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1

i never understood why so many people see depression as something we can all joke about so fucking carelessly and casually like its funny and relatable to see tweets and memes about how much depression sucks but it really does so much harm than good doesnt it i cant understand how this is just so commonplace i laugh at them theyre funny i see myself in them and then for hours and days upon days i lock myself in my car with a vague numbness ditching class or calling off work to just what stare off into a void and roll around uncomfortably in my drivers seat in a shitty parking lot chew through a pack of cigarettes and just try to settle down suicidal compulsions i stare in the rearview mirror and gastation bathrooms for forty minutes trying to make sense of whos looking back and why the sight of that person makes my stomach churn i dont sleep for days on end until i collapse i lose weight in 7 pound intervals the thoughts of being a fuckup and how bad i would beat the shit out of myself if i met myself on the street just stew any time im beside myself its so funny so quirky and relatable if this is relatable thats fucking tragic being a ball of despondency and wanting to break my bones with a baseball bat is something i want everyone to laugh at with me its three am here and im just having a cigarette in an empty bathroom tub because i dont wanna think about anything i wish there was a way to turn brains off medications havent worked and i dont like being medicated at all anyway it feels like hitting a plaster wall anytime i try to feel anything sure is loads of fun,pre-pandemic,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1

hi reddit throwaway because its hard for me to talk about this type of stuff i wanted to reach out and see if anyone else had had this type of situation before and if anyone had any advice to offer quick backstory im a 24 year old female with a great job that i love college degrees an attractive sweet boyfriend and a supportive family no one knows that ive been struggling with depression and anxiety on and off for years now my mom knew about it when it first started happening when i was 14 but she hasnt suspected anything for a long time and my boyfriend of 15 years has no idea either its hard to hide it sometimes but i try my best ive also selfharmed on and off for years just every once in a while for a week or so at a time i havent cut for almost a year and a half but ive been feeling the itch very strong lately i can barely stop myself from doing it and my resolve is wearing very thin work stress but primarily relationship stress has been causing my depression to flare back up normally i can handle it without medication but ive been struggling a lot lately ive recently been having issues in my relationship regarding him respecting me and the potential beginnings of verbal abuse during our arguments however he is the best and sweetest boyfriend ive ever had but im feeling so trapped and suffocated right now while im with him i just want to run away im not sure if its something deeper or not but i wanted to know if anyone else has self sabotaged their relationship like this he is trying so hard to make me happy but im so apathetic about the whole thing and im starting to think depression is to blame it is getting to be winter time as well when it starts to raise its ugly head more frequently people keep saying its just a phase in our relationship but i dont feel that way i feel so negatively towards our relationship for almost no reason at all has anyone else ever self sabotaged a great relationship for no reason and do you think your depression was partially to blame tldr great life great boyfriend but find myself self sabotaging the relationship through my unhappiness and apathy has anyone else had experience with something like this,pre-pandemic,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

some time ago i told a woman i love you unconditionally she replied unconditional love does not exist i whispered back watch me she soon broke up with me partly because as many girls have done in the past she felt insufficient about herself in the face of someone who possesses more empathy than her sorry not sorry that is simply a fact not a delusion on my part some of them have straight up admitted this to me unconditional love did not exist in her worldbecause deep down she believed that she was incapable of loving anyone unconditionally and she was projecting that alleged inability onto the rest of the world my father was a diagnosable sociopath my grandfather partially recognized this as soon as he observed the behavior of my 5yearold father i recognized it when reflecting back about how my father abused me physically mentally emotionally and sexually how could someone do the things he did to his own son a lack of empathy the capacity to understand or feel what another person is experiencing certainly helps and a denial of love and an embracing of selfishness also helps being raised by a diagnosable sociopathpsychopath someone who lacks empathy i was attracted to and attracted other sociopaths in my relationships my very first girlfriend admitted to me i hate it when you cry about the suffering of others because when you talk about how you feel bad for them and how they are hurting it makes me feel bad about myself because i feel nothing in that moment i felt both scared of her but i also admired her brutal honesty i still love her despite how she hurt and cheated on me by the way after intense years of therapy something every single one of you would benefit greatly from but most of you are too proud to recognize that just as you go to a doctor for physical health it is only common sense to go to a doctor for a mental health checkup i have now gotten over my tendency to be attracted to and attract sociopathspsychopaths so how can i help you with your depression anxiety and pain youve been hurt people have hurt you people are not simply dichotomously separated into two categories of empaths or sociopaths they are on a spectrum everyone has varying degrees of empathy additionally wherever one lies on the spectrum of empathy does not determine how they will treat others people do have free wills and the ability to make choices sorry intellectual elites who believe it is all an illusion i understand where you are coming from but you are wrong an empathetic person can live a bad life and a sociopath can probably live a good life you need to accept the hurt that has happened to you you need to seek professional help to work through it you need to find a counselor who isnt lazy and just prescribes pills in order to make money and turn you into a safe zombie im not saying all medication is bunk take your meds you need to accept others and then establish boundaries that no one can cross in order to protect yourself you need to accept yourself you need to love yourself you will never find true love or accept true love until you can first love yourself it will never happen until you realize this fact and act upon it you are selfish you are a social creature like an ant you are supposed to work for the good of the colony and your fellow humans and all life on earth as long as you are selfish you will suffer from depression anxiety and pain and your pills will not save you some time ago i told a woman i love you unconditionally she replied unconditional love does not exist i almost believed her but i no longer have any doubt instead i have faith i have faith in myself i have faith in jesus whatever jesus means to you even if you are an atheist and most of all no matter how much or how little empathy you possess i have faith in you start choosing love and you will become free from your suffering,pre-pandemic,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1
the first part of my soul is old and wise the part thats been through pain heartbreak death and disease that part is the one thats been depressed for 3 years and has been living with a painful chronic illness for 4 that part has broken hearts and has been heartbroken thats the part that has seen those around me die its the part of me thats a 90yearold woman who has experienced life and gotten everything out of it she can and is now ready to die then theres the part of me thats still a 16yearold girl the part thats still trying to figure out life and is full of happiness and curiosity the part that wants to stay up all night go to college and get drunk the part that is innocent and doesnt know a whole lot about life the part that still gets excited to do things most of the time the 16yearold girl can take over and convince the 90yearold woman that there are still things worth living for but sometimes the 90yearold takes the reigns and makes the 16yearold think that life has been experienced enough now and its time to go,pre-pandemic,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

the title and this story may sound fake new account to hopefully protect my identity but i swear to you it could not be more real for me i wanted to share this i am not doing this for attention but merely to seek help more questions will be asked at the end of my story as the title describes a miracle has occurred given the severity and intent of the crash the paramedics police doctors nurses and my parents all gave me the most puzzled look of their lives when they asked how fast i was going and i replied 200 kmh i have been depressed for 4 years now nothing has been working and my mental health has declined terribly i have been on multiple medications tried behavioural therapy such as cognitive behaviour therapy cbt and even went a course of electroconvulsive therapy ect first my motivation to do anything went down i couldnt eat do school work and most importantly socialize my social circle grew smaller as my depression grew bigger after 4 years of suffering as well as other health conditions such as horrible eyesight 1000 in each eye with astigmatism sleep apnea and anxiety i figured life wasnt going to get any better and i decided to end my life i drove to the mountains where i decided i would find a large hill go full speed down it and either turn into the median or drive off the road ultimately killing myself about 3 hours from my hometown i found the perfect hill the road was steep perfect for gaining speed to ensure a fatal crash without thinking too much i would just talk myself out and not commit i pulled a uturn and drove to the hill which was about 5 minutes after that point they say your life flashes before your eyes mine played back to me for those 5 minutes the most important people and influential moments of my life appeared before my eyes they suddenly disappeared as i approached my chosen hill my foot automatically floored the gas pedal i placed my left foot behind the brake so i wouldnt back out i raced down the hill gaining more and more speed by the time i reached the bottom my car which only has a speedometer for up to 200 kmh i saw the road start to bend and i jerked my wheel into the opposite direction of the turn slamming the front end of the car into the median that was the last thing i remembered before waking up in my car with tapping on the window from bystanders all i could think to myself at that moment was wow i so much of a failure i cant even kill myself a bystander described to the paramedics and police that i hit the median did about 10 spins no flips and then continued to scrape median down the hill for another 250m i got a glimpse of my car before i was taken away in an ambulance it was completely destroyed when i arrived to the hospital i was placed in the trauma room however the doctor was incredibly surprised after seeing me sitting upright with consciousness after a 200 kmh car accident he assessed me and ordered a fullbody ct scan the results came back clean no bleeding no broken bones and most importantly no death he then admitted me to the psychiatry ward which i wont get into on this post but it was a nightmare the everyones surprise i was barely injured walking away with a concussion with memory loss at most this phrase really stuck in my mind because nearly every person i have talked to so far has said its a miracle youre alive im not religious but i agree it is a miracle im alive and im not going to waste it im begging for help because i know this community loves to help people when they reach out i really want to try and beat my depression but i dont know how i have tried cbt im going back to ect for another round of treatment and im on increased medication i will be seeing counsellors and psychiatrists however thanks to canadian healthcare not until 2020 which is one of the reasons i decided to end it due to lack of resources if anyone out there has any tips on how to manage severe depression and anxiety please let me know im still alive today despite the severity of the crash and i believe its a sign that i need to conquer this depression and do something great with my life i am tired of laying at home with no energy and no motivation wasting away my life every day with my depression i can personally say even those who are suiciding dont want to die they merely just want to stop existing please help with any advice you have im begging for my life to change please i am trying my best to push past my depression and suicidal thinking so i can give life another try here are a list of specific questions that would benefit a lot how do i keep

tldr im not depressed and i dont really understand much about the condition but whenever i think over how to help people with depression i struggle with the idea that depressed people shouldnt be catered to how do i treat people i am close to when they are in a depressed state maybe this concept wont go over well but i want to get some perspective on the idea that many depressed people were conditioned to be depressed by the people around them i feel like people need to take responsibility for their own attitude towards life in general everyone has bad periods in their life and may be sad for an extended period of time but if a person allows that period to extend for an unreasonably long time it is their own fault and those around them should hold the depressed person accountable when i was a child sometimes i was sad and depressed and in some cases my parents would reach out to me when i was in that state if i tried to milk that more than was reasonable the emotional support from those around me would stop i wasnt allowed to be depressed all day if i wanted to get along with my family instinctually i tried to get what i wanted by being sad and i had to have some hard lessons growing up to condition that behavior out of me i feel like some people who are depressed may not have gotten enough of those experiences to say to themselves you know what being sad isnt going to get me anywhere so i need to change my attitude and genuinely believe that idea maybe my ideas of depression are backwards and obviously they dont apply to everyone with depression but i struggle when dealing with people around me when they are in depressedsad states do i give them emotional support and try to make them feel better and when that doesnt help at what point to i stop coddling them and be supportive but not enabling,pre-pandemic,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
i wish i wasnt so socially retarded its getting annoying going on so many first dates and never second dates at first i thought it was because i was ugly or because i had narrow shoulders but now im having to accept that im just an asshat ive probably contacted 500 people through online dating probably been on 50 first dates and i dont have any friends in real life so theres no social circle for me to date in at least diagnose me with aspergers or something at least then my ego could take the hit im feeling okay right now and im not gonna go shooting up any fraternity but i completely understand the feelings that elliot rodger had when he decided to do what he did it sucks to be a dude denied time after time when everyone around you seems to be succeeding without trying when i get the money ill be seriously contemplating a chemical castration so that i dont constantly have an unscratchable itch,pre-pandemic,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1

when youre 18 you can make mistakes you have the time to fix them they dont define the rest of your life you have a decade to build a life for yourself there is always that hope that one day things might turn out well for you there is excitement life is full of colour but off in the distance you see a storm and road in greyscale then you turn 30 and suddenly the road ahead that looked dark and stormy ahead of you is the road youre now walking down and all you can see is darkness for the next 50 years of your life nobody is coming to save you or bail you out i would give anything to go back and do things over but there is no reset button you cant start a new save file all you can do is turn off the game for people in their late teensearly twenties dont waste a moment appreciate the time you are living in and the fact that you have several important years to work with they disappear without warning and one day it will hit you like a fucking dump truck in the chest that you have lost them forever,pre-pandemic,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0
recently i think ive been okay not super happy but not completely down in the dumps but ever since about a week ago ive been getting passive suicidal thoughts if you dont know what that is its when you think about suicide but have no actual plan or motive to do it this has happened every day even this morning my first thought when getting out of bed was i should just die these thoughts get annoying as it demotivates me from what i have to do during the day which makes me feel useless which makes me think about suicide its an endless fucking cycle and i hate it,pre-pandemic,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,1

hi im not french i just like french i last went on here 5 months ago time flies and that distresses me because i havent really been doing much apart from trying to get through school im in year 12 doing ib the equivalent of as levels and its hard work so havent had much time for actually living life for fun isnt it a sad reflection upon society when we spend so much time in academics we are born have 5 years of bliss then go to school for at least 11 years if not more most people stay on another 2 then go to uni for anything up to 12 years then they get a job which takes up the majority of their life until they can finally retire just in time to have a few years of being old before they die see life is this amazing and mysterious thing yet we squander it society makes us dependant on the system for survival im from the uk by the way onto my proper point recently due in no small part to the sheer monotony of my life at school ive been becoming apathetic about everything and i genuinely mean everything things i should be happy about im not however i suppose at times im getting upset about things which is something at least im not completely neutral and every day i change my mood not intentionally at the moment im feeling down and embracing the nihilistic outlook on life however tomorrow i may wake up feeling positive about life and think about the existentialist view recently i have no fixed viewpoints on anything i play devils advocate so well i dont know what i believe so yeah generally im apathetic but my mood changes so much its hard to know,pre-pandemic,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1
