people always say that it will get better but thats not necessarily true life is not a fairytale where problems get solved at the end and people get to live happily ever after maybe for some people it will get better but for many others it wont theres plenty of examples of people who had awful lives and it never got better for them sometimes it got worst as time went on also what if its too late by the time it gets better what about all those things you didnt do all those experiences you missed out on if you spent most of your life being miserable and missing out on so much stuff then was it really a life worth living of course these people will probably say yes but thats because they dont know what is like to miss out on so much they might try to relate but at the end of the day they still lived fulfilling life also what if people dont want to get better some people go through so much stuff that they no longer want their lives to improve they just want to end it,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

a harsh truth white americans dont want to accept is many have stronger links and ties to terrorism than a majority of the muslim immigrants they fear the degrees of separation between someone in a terrorist organization are significantly less than it would be for most muslims for example it is way more likely they would have a sibling cousin uncle close family friend who is a part of a rightwing paramilitary organization than the reza family down street would have to the muslim brotherhood unfortunately its probably difficult to truly investigate given how hesitant white people are to associate a predominantly white organization with terrorism,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

weed sends me into paranoid episodes where i heavily disassociate or think someone is trying to hurt me and no matter how much i assert that ive always had bad experiences with weed people continue to suggest it to me as this like magical cure for all my symptoms someone even told me to stop going to therapy and just smoke instead lol im really glad that it helps some people a lot but its honestly not for everyone edit i see some people misinterpreting my point so ill say again that im not implying that weed or other substances dont help people its just hurtful when people refuse to take no for answer and try to pressure you to do it whether thats through friends or dms im glad some people have good experiences and want other people to as well but its not helpful to nag someone about it if they say no especially when its a stranger,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

my brother has been battling internal issues for the past several years ever since he had what might seem like a spiritual awakening he hasnt been the same he recently started fasting claiming that god led him to do it to and is waiting for his sign to stop he apparently believes there is a higher purpose to his starvation but he hasnt eaten an actual meal in almost 2 months and has only been eating fruits a few times a week now hes saying that if god decides he needs to die to save his family then he will however we feel he is acting under delusion and have tried talking sense into him but have had no success he refuses to eat and much less to seek medical attention we dont know how to approach this difficult situation but im hoping someone has had experience with something similar and can offer some guidance or advice thank you for reading this,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0
