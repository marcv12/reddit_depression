im very nervous and freaking out i dont know anyone thats going there i only know some people that went to high school with me but i was never close to them im scared of being perceived as weird and awkward im really anxious and scared i wont fit in or make any friends my social anxiety ruins so many things for me and i like meeting new people but just the thought of having to interact with strangers makes me nauseous,post-pandemic
shes this girl who works at a local tobacco shop i kind of knew she probably had a boyfriend and id get shut down she was super polite and it was all good i imagine it will be a little bit easier next time i want to do this i was embarrassed for a few minutes but it passed eventually sitting here the next day i cant believe i did that but im proud of myself just had to tell someone thanks guys edit just to add what was going through my mind at the time my psychologist has really been getting me to expose myself to uncomfortable situations especially when you know theyre going to be uncomfortable i kind of figured she had a boyfrienddidnt date customers or whatever but i considered this an experiment in allowing myself to become uncomfortable and just sitting with that feeling for a while its this kind of stuff that almost literally rewires your brain albeit small amounts over time if you keep avoiding things your brain will get used to it and thats how you end up using avoidance to deal with being uncomfortable if you expose yourself to those uncomfortable situations and allow them to run their course those feelings start to become a lot less scary over time which can help build confidence im no psychologist so that was probably a c at best explanation but hopefully it makes some sense edit 2 holy moley the amount of encouragement and props is insane you all are awesome thank you,pre-pandemic

hi all ive been trying to support my friend who has health anxiety but i just dont know if what im doing is the right way or if im accidentally making it worse for her ive just met up with her after coming back to my hometown from university after a while and she looks noticeably worse like more jittery ive know her for as long as i could remember shes always been battling with eating disorders and im proud of how far shes gotten through it but the past few years shes been worrying more and more about her health with an obsession on the types of food she should and shouldnt eat to the point that it takes over her thoughts day and night ive made myself available to her 247 to call whenever her thoughts become too much but its becoming harder and harder to keep my word since i have other responsibilities like workuniversity and dealing with my own issues its also been a lot harder for me to know how to help since im not chatting with her in person as much as we use to the last thing i want to do is make the problem worse i give her advice like find distractions maybe seek therapy go on walks listen to music learn how to draw and tell her how proud i am but i feel so defeated when i see her look worse and its hard to stay positive are these the right things to say and what else could i say to help her,post-pandemic
hi all im new here but not new to the health anxiety problem as i grow older ive become aware of my increasing ability to actually cause myself physical pain and to put a stop to it with my thoughts its a rather strange phenomenon i thought id share some tricks if you start having something like chest pains try and associate it to something external i have a thing where if i notice chest pains i imagine that my smartphone is causing it via rf radiation i then turn on airplane mode or walk away from my phone and the pain pretty much goes away immediately this works only because im by nature a paranoid person so the whole rf radiation thing is plausible on some level and could actually be true that last part is exactly why this trick works you need to believe it,post-pandemic
so ive been experiencing many episodes of grandiose thinking and super high self esteem and feeling like i can literally change the world and like i am the best person in the world since im a child ive done some stupid things during those episodes and in between i have very bad depression episodes getting worse each time the last one i had extreme fatigue like never before even if i slept 12 hours a day it just feels like the higher i feel the lower i will feel after my therapist said there were chances i might be bipolar but he didnt see me long enough to tell i just cant tell whether it might be bipolar or just me being a very delusional person here are a few of these delusional episodes once i dropped out of college overnight because i was convinced i was a genius and that i was gonna be the next big thing in the music industry like literally the best singer in the world my plan was to start posting covers on social media and then go abroad to convince big labels to sign me all of that in a couple months another weird delusional episode when i booked a train ticket overnight without a return trip and travelled to another country to meet my celebrity crush i was convinced that as soon as wed meet theyd think im the most amazing smartest and talented person in the world and that wed become instant best friends and that theyd even offer to host me until i could find myself a deal with universal music because i was convinced i had an undeniable talent for music i had nothing to show them i was intending to convince them with my speech because i was sure no one could write speeches as powerful as me i took 3 suitcases with me because i was convinced i was gonna be offered to stay at their house and that id get the deal with the label so i basically thought i was moving out of my country for good in the end i stayed there for 1 month convinced that all of that was going to happen when i realised what i did i couldnt understand how i could possibly believe such things and i felt so embarrassed another time i almost quit my job in the end they fired me first because i thought i had a gift to motivate people and that my words were so powerful so i decided that i was gonna move next to the sea and become a motivation influencer on tiktok and live out of that and that lives of millions of people were gonna be changed because of my gift once i even considered getting into politics in the perspective of becoming president because i was such a smart person with great ideas that it would be a waste to keep it for myself another time when i was 15 i wrote a whole novel and sent it to publishers and i didnt even get replies from them yet that i asked my parents to go overseas to show my story to screenwriters so that they could adapt my novel that wasnt even released into a blockbuster movie in which i would have the main part i was already ready to quit school because i was convinced my life was about to change i also had periods in which instead of grandiose i felt these random outbursts of rage for no reason followed by strong desire to burst into tears and lots of paranoia switching to survival mode like everyone is a potential murderer i have to protect myself so i started doing research about how to read body language etc so that i could spot the most dangerous people around me and i started thinking my parents were not my real parents that the real ones were murdered before my eyes and that those parents adopted me and lied to me the whole time or when i bump into a group of strangers in the streets i think theyre talking about me what is making me doubt whether i am bipolar or just delusional is that i do love music and ive always wanted to have a career in that field but when it comes to music its just the way i see things that is different from period to period i keep alternating between periods of grandiose where i think im incredibly gifted and i dont need anyone to teach me that i can just quit everything now to do that even though in not grandiose periods i know i still have lots of progress to do etc but in the other periods i will just think that im ordinary and have no particular gift and that i need tons of hard work and professional training if i want to become any good and in parallel have a more serious career but i am a person with such low self esteem that those grandiose thoughts just seem so off to me also in those grandiose periods i start talking super fast and cant stop and i start eating super healthy over exercising and being super sociable and hyperaware and i overshare a lot what do you think,post-pandemic
my coworker told me that she has bpd and it made me think about how everyone talks about her when shes not listening everyone loves her they say shes beautiful bubbly and has an infectious laugh they dont see any of the insecurities she sees in herself so i guess what im saying is that this has given me a new perspective on how we are seen in society and that its not 100 negative,pre-pandemic

it seems like everyone has an opinion and they want to tell me how its my fault and how i did something wrong yeah right theyre not there in the situation and they have no idea whats going on my opinion and understanding of my experiences and my role of them is the only one i care about i am selfaware and humble enough to admit when im wrong so i dont need anyone elses criticism on me they are making up their own story in their own head that is only a reflection of who they are inside i dont know about anyone else but this is what i know about my life and im sticking to it their bullshit rolls like water off my back i cant hear those stupid lies anymore ive just got the beautiful noise of my own self through my ears now,pre-pandemic

hello im new to my diagnosis and trying to work out everything lately i have noticed when i go on nights out i end up going random places ive never been and making friends with locals and end up going somewhere else with them sharing taxis and not having a care in the world theyve been good nights out when ive told people about my nights out theyre really concerned that i have been going off with strangers and actually now im sitting here im thinking that yes its not normal i seem to be doing this on impulse and when im drunk i dont think about consequences i just want to have a fun night and party with people but i can see why there is a concern there do you think i should tell my psychiatrist is this bipolar or more just my personality,post-pandemic
i made so much progress i went to community college instead of university to keep myself sober in therapy and accountable by the end of the first semester i was a bit over it but nothing too bad then i fell into depression and relapsed with drugs doing a lot of oxy but 30s are never really 30s it stopped helping i started school again and the first two weeks i had one class and i could manage it was nice to have something to do because of my depression i signed up really really late so all my classes were virtual without any real lectures you teach yourself from the textbook learning statistics is hard like that and i couldnt even try my first class was about drugs and substance abuse and i think just ended up being a trigger my last class is a poetry class and its the only one im somewhat following i want to drop them give up in a way and let life be my therapist says its a bad idea because everything will go down funny how i only open up in the last 10 minutes of therapy and then feel so fucked up and vulnerable when i leave the oxy isnt doing anything anymore coke feels mediocre im not doing an insane amount like i used to i have been craving meth which is like the worst drug and i hate that i know it will fuck up everything i feel like it would just speed up the inevitable i also stopped taking my meds 2 weeks ago i know youre probably thinking im an idiot and i am its crazy how fast shit changes i was paranoid and manicy like 5 days ago i feel like life is never getting better i want it to i just want to be cared about but that kind of care that i want isnt healthy or sustainable especially from the people in my life lol if u read all that thanks i just desperately need support and advice brutal advice tbh,post-pandemic
why do you think that may be,post-pandemic

every time i mention how many calories i eat or something about my ed i get people coming in and saying well your just messing up your metabolism and eating such low calories will not make you lose weight and now im conflicted and scared bc eating more has to equal gaining weight but eating less now also equals gaining weight so now i feel guilty eating and guilty not eating and idk what to do,post-pandemic
been having a tough time with health anxiety for at least over a decade now i guess i wanted to ask everyone if you notice things that reduce your health anxietyfixations i think health anxiety for me decreases when i focus my obsessive tendencies elsewhere the more productive the better such as creative hobbies specific topics of interest etc what have you all noticed in your experience edit some newish strategies for me in combatting hyperfixating are 1 writing on a calendar 2 weeks in the future have symptoms persisted this has helped me in that if in 2 weeks things have not gotten worsetheyve improved i will not follow up with it 2 if i hyperfixate on a different symptom sometimes the other thing id noticed disappears in a way this helps to remind me that i am likely fixating of course if things do persist getting checked out by a doctor is the next step also i dont guarantee these strategies will work for you but just writing them in case they can help somebody im still journaling on what helps me and tweaking the strategies as i go,post-pandemic
10 days sober from cocaine after 2 years of a hefty cocaine addition and it finally happened after a 3 night bender i was at my ends huddled in a corner of my room writing endless thoughts on a piece of scratch paper and it finally hit me i needed sobriety way more than it needed me and i was willing to fight for it 10 days less than two weeks the longest streak i have had free of this monster in over two years i know this shit isnt anything to write home about yet but damn i am proud edit i have officially reached 43 days of sobriety a post i never thought id see from myself still fighting everyday but so happy with where i am at want to say thank you to everyone in this community your posts help push me further everyday,pre-pandemic
m 23 i have ptsd due to being sexually abused as a child i started applying ancient philosophy in my life in late 2021 and had a spiritual awakening by mid 2022 and it lasted a for 3 months circa basically all i did was studying a podcast that teaches ancient middle eastern and asian philosophy and use those teachings in my life doing martial arts definitely helped my achievements it was a great experience and im thankful for that while i was awakened i didnt had any ptsd symptoms and i felt i could achieve everything i had in mind for example i could almost see someone who was literally behind me im pretty sure i could see myself in third person just like in a videogame but from the top of my head i could recognize immediately if someone was lying to me just like neo in matrix i could notice more stuff that i wouldnt notice normally body language facial expressions ecc my memory was better i felt more connected to nature around me i could heal other people that were sickit was very risky tho because it would take a lot of energy physically mentally and emotionally stronger great reflexes feeling like heaven on earth these experiences are pretty much what i felt during my awakening as i said it didnt last much timethree months and there is also a dark side that it would be irresponsible and criminal for me not to warn you during my awakening i worked in a sect or a cult of course they didnt told me that they were a fucking cult they hire me to do a life threatening job as a goldsmith and while i worked there 6 months they actively tried to gaslight me they would mostly accuse me of things that they didits a ritual that every new member must receive could you imagine like a hundred of people that are committed to lie and deceive you in the sixth month working there they sent cars in front of my home the cars ran towards me like they were about to crash or something after that i just left and tried to find another job six months after leaving that job an autobus from another country purposely tried to run me over and the only reason i survived is that i still had reflexes from my spiritual awakening unfortunately after that incidenteight months ago i never felt awakened again do i suggest people to be awakened just like i did my answer is literally i dont know i dont know if its worth it as im still on my journey the only thing i would like is that people should start to understand is that these feelings and experiences do exist and everyone should be able to choose to be awakened or not this is my story if youd like to hear about the ancient middle eastern and asian philosophy just dm me and ill send you a link for the podcast thx for reading edit awakening is basically balancing your left and your right side of the brain and after that be automatically able to connecting it to your heart,post-pandemic

just a heads up this may be a long read it all depends on how much i decide to get off of my chest and this may be a difficult for some to read so i understand if you dont so i have ptsd due to various abuses suffered throughout my childhood and being in the position where i had to be an adult at 14 my mother was a drug addict prescription pills throughout my teens and mid20s i pretty much denied i had anything working against me mentally despite all that i denied the fact that i was an absolute insomniac found myself repeatedly in abusive relationships because i felt for some reason i deserved that my sons mother and i experienced a very traumatic loss and i eventually had a nervous breakdown i made an attempt on my own life and thankfully failed at it after that i voluntarily checked myself into the ward and proceeded to start getting the help i so desperately needed of course like anything it was a process it wasnt an overnight fix and thats for damn certain during that time period my mom got clean and i had her back for about 4 years before the years of drug abuse caught up to her after her passing i found a good therapist and i saw her for a little over 3 years i started putting my foot down stopped allowing myself to be walked on and did my best to become the best father i could possibly be this is something i still strive to do eventually i would become my grandmothers caretaker because the only other help she has is my developmentally delayed uncle this brings us to present day january 24th of last year my cousin was renting out our small apartment over our garage at some point she had fallen off of the wagon and we were not aware of that that evening i got a phone call from my 13yearold cousin her daughter and shes absolutely hysterical apparently she went upstairs to get things together in order to take a shower before going to bed and she found her mother unresponsive i got up there and i could tell she was already gone but because of the fact that her daughter was there i did my best cpr chest compressions anything to try and attempt to get some sort of a heartbeat or a pulse sadly it was all for not we got the coroners report a little over 2 weeks ago and the official cause of death was a pulmonary embolism now im trying my best to get into counseling during this whole thing and my grandmother ends up having to go into the hospital she had a bad fall at the start of last year reinjured her back after an old injury and has been spending time in a wheelchair my cousin and i got funds together and got her a better one she used it for less than 48 hours and her back started giving her hell so much in fact that she actually asked us to take her to the hospital today i got a phone call from the doctor and hes telling me shes got anywhere from 6 to 18 months to live shes experiencing heart failure i dont know what to do shes been my rock my one consistent relative i could always depend on when things got hard yes she is an 86 year old type 2 diabetic the doctors were thinking open heart surgery but they feel as if it is too risky shes not a good candidate for stents at this point im just trying to help her get her affairs in order im 42 and i am so f scared im trying to stay strong so my kids dont see me lose it my 10 year old son is incredibly close to her hes on the spectrum and more often than not shes one of the few people that can get through to him when hes having an episode his 5 year old brother would make it a point every morning to say good morning and tell her he loves her before going off to school and she was always the first person he ran to when he got in the door im barely sleeping im imagining the worst and i have tasks ahead i fear will break me,post-pandemic

i dont know how else to word the title so let me explain in text basically i work with my fp i told them once last year that i was interested in them romantically but after a short convo they turned me down gently and we agreed to just be friends ever since then i cant seem to stop thinking about them for long sometimes we would hang out together outside of work most often with at least one other coworker than the two of us i even pet sit for them when they went out of town despite being afraid of close proximity to animals lately ive been distancing myself and trying not to even look at them directly if we talk its mostly work related and if not i cut the conversation short and go find some task to do or something to clean at work im even trying to change my schedule to avoid working with them that much i recently told them that i had been having a hard time over the last year as part of an apology for being a bit too much on a particularly stressful day things were chaotic busy and we were definitely understaffed and overwhelmed that night and i got frustrated and started splitting and being passive aggressive i apologized for my behavior because i felt bad but now im wondering if i should have left out the part about having a hard time dealing with the feelings i have for them and the rejection from almost a year ago tldr is it worth trying to be transparent about struggling with unrequited romantic feelings for my fp a year after they rejected me or should i have just kept to myself like i had been doing,post-pandemic
i am so beyond tired of waking up day in and day out to these negative and intrusive feelings and thoughts being played on repeat in my head its to the point where ive been giving more and more thought to just disappearing from peoples lives not even saying goodbye just disappearing obliterating every real connection that i have so i can slip further and further into solitude maybe i just want to make it easier for when i finally decide to off myself i dont know what i do know is that everything feels so pointless i cant stop feeling numb and empty i just want to sever all my ties and connections so i can be alone so i can selfdestruct alone i cant even remember a time where i felt ok i dont think ill ever feel ok again and its not ok to feel this way no one should ever ever have to feel this way ever but yet some of us do and it fucking sucks i wish i could just absorb all the bad feelings everyone in the world has and just take them with me to the grave,pre-pandemic

dont get me wrong when i call myself the ugly friend it doesnt mean i am ugly myself in fact ive been told im pretty what i mean is that type of friend that is always left out romantically you could say i had a friend she was 19f lets call her m ever since i know m she has always been very popular not the toxic popular type you see in american movies she is actually a good person and dear to me however unlike me m has always been surrounded by people specially guys she has been with more than 15 guys for the three years that ive known her whenever weve met new peoplethey have always been drawn to m never to me i can see why she is way more extroverted than i am she has gorgeous make up and a beautiful body and style even if i am a pretty girl too i feel overlapped i am not jealous of her though she is not the problem and most of the guys who are her type arent that attractive to me i get i can be shy at times i avoid physical interactions even if its a hug or a kiss on the cheek unless i am comfortable with someone and ive known them for some time i also know i can be a bit weird and sometimes the things i say might come across as insensitive or blunt but really what went wrong i dont want to be surrounded by guys like she is she plays with them and then throws them to the trash i dont want to be like her however deep down no matter how many times i deny this to myself i yearn for a romantic connection i yearn for someone that looks at me the way those guys look at m i yearn for cute dates and the feeling of holding another persons hand i yearn for someone to love me for something that isnt my body thanks for coming to my ted talk,post-pandemic

the new research indicates that ptsd develops along two separate tracks one involving fear conditioning and intrusive thoughts and one involving symptoms associated with depression those two tracks could be separately identified and treated the team behind the study says based on this evidence its critically important that potential ptsd sufferers are diagnosed and given help as early as possible science alert,pre-pandemic
it feels like nobody fucking cares unless you are under 25 female here ive seen a ton of males in this sub opening up about their problems and nobody cares about them and they are just left at it while in the other hand if its a teen girl opening up dudes just rush into the comment section trying to hit on the girl and not even trying to help them this sub is more like a dating site a few days ago i made a post opening up and dudes just rushed into my dms asking me if i was a girl and when i said no they just left at it this sub is filled with pervs trying to hit on women,post-pandemic

very interesting research x200b,post-pandemic
so i saw a doctor feelgood from last january until june i came in because my previous doctor took me off of oxycontin 6 months before and only had me on less than half the amount of ir oxycodone that covered what the combination of ir oxycodone and oxycontin was giving so it put me straight into withdrawals i told them that im not coping not sleeping they didnt care theyd continue tapering this new doctor put me back on what they put me on at the start and temazepam for sleep for several weeks instead of the oxycontin i said isnt it bad to be on two benzodiazepines she said no and that plenty of her patients were on multiple benzodiazepines i told her that i wanted to be on the temazepam for the shortest amount of time and hopefully get back on my oxycontin eventually i did then she put me on a 12mcghr fentanyl patch and initially the pain relief was amazing this was at the end of march then she gave me liquid oxycodone too then in may before my exams she abruptly stopped seeing me no gp would see me so i went through 4 days of withdrawals from fentanyl she put me on 40mg oxycodone and it did nothing i was in such a bad way that i couldnt work and i had my exams coming up within days so i had to see an addiction doctor he forced her to continue prescribing the fentanyl patches and oxycodone and everything but he diagnosed me with oud so i was declared an addict because she put me on that crap i had to wait until there was a detox bed available to initiate me into sublocade which is actually the best painkiller ive ever had ive never back pain ever since but as a result ive lost my psychiatrist he discharged me when i went into the psyche ward twice despite still being administered my adhd medication because i was in hospital for a combined long time i had 150 tablets left and was given another 84 upon discharge that lasted me until the 25th of january but i shouldve not taken them until uni started my new gp rewrote a referral to my psychiatrist saying that he cant just do this to me and to represcribe my medication asap but ive heard nothing the psychiatrist wants me to see an addiction psychiatrist whats the difference i just need my meds or my grades will tank i start university in 2 weeks the whole system is just garbage my reputation has been destroyed i hate being an addict,post-pandemic
making this throwaway account to tell you all what this sub has done for me six months ago my drinking hit its peak in summer i dislocated my elbow fractured my wrist sprained my ankle but the cherry on top was pissing myself whilst sleeping on multiple friends couches whilst blackout drunk i come from a long line of alcoholics my relationship history is unsurprisingly jampacked with heavy drinkers and ive felt increasingly doomed my father left the family when i was very young and has been on the run since a warrant was put out for a dui fatality that he caused my mother has been a heavy drinker since i could remember last year i learned that with a little preparation i could come back home after drinking in a social situation and plough into more booze without anybody telling me just how much of a mess i was last night then i was drinking alone consistently two bottles of wine and a four pack when i ran out of alcohol id get a taxi to the casino in the city and drink there until 5 in the morning praying nobody i knew would recognise me in my day to day life i look like i have my shit together but i havent told even my closest friends about the family i come from nor the real extent of my drinking at no point did anyone i know pull me aside and ask if i was okay though i was careful to give no indication that this secret life of mine existed though even if they had i would not have listened to them anyway then when i was blitzed in the spur of the moment i followed this sub over the next few months this community articulated my secret life back to me for someone with zero support network and friends and family that will encourage me to drink until the day that they die this has been a godsend i havent yet had the courage to go to aa when i went to a therapist i tried to make them guess unsuccessfully what was wrong with me bringing these things up with people close to me makes me literally feel faint but if theres others like me out there reading this please dont underestimate how useful communicating on a sub like this can be to you its also only been two months which is two months more than i ever thought possible but i feel like ive started to heal and reconnect with the scared inquisitive kid i used to be at 26m ive found the first woman in my life who i sincerely love that doesnt drink i never thought id be happy going out for tea and ice cream over drinks thank you to you all for being here through this im appreciative of you all and hope i can be of help to others from now on i have the rest of my life to look forward to as a testament to this godspeed,post-pandemic

suggestions i 34 yo started medication for adhd a couple of weeks ago initial treatment was methylphenidate ir 5mg bid the first few days had mild side effects but otherwise i felt an instant increase in the ability to quiet my mind and focus after 5 days i felt the most calm focused and hopeful about being able to function in this world there were no moments of euphoria but i cried at times because i felt so normal and outside of my own head for the first time in my life per my providers instructions i increased the ir to 10mg bid at this point the initial side effects faded and i felt like i had a handle on this but i didnt like the up and down feeling throughout the day and having to take a midday dose also my job makes it difficult to take the ir at the same times every day after two weeks on it my provider suggested switching to concerta i started the generic 36mg er the first day was awful i had some small problems come up at home that i felt i could not manage i felt racy and not myself even when there was no problems i felt like there was like dread almost i couldnt focus as well and felt completely depressed but with energy this was not unfamiliar as ive been treating depression for a year which really improved after i began bupropion 8 months ago for 2 months before that i was on lexapro and it was a nightmare it made me feel worse in the end a lot like this actually i chocked the concerta up to it being a new dose and delivery day two was much the same now trying day 3 has anyone else experienced this either switching from ir to er or starting concerta in general i want to try this for a least a few weeks before giving up but im reticent because i did that for 2 months with a different drug and dont want to feel like this months,post-pandemic
i used to take 6mg invega and my psychiatrist suggested that i might switch to ziprasidone he prescribed invega 3mg for tapering and zisperidone i know that antipsychotics helps people with schizophrenia but i also know it can cause impaired speech stuttering and conginitive impairment from my experience do you have trouble communicating with other people do you sleep well do you have a job do you have trouble taking care of yourself is their problem with your concentration,post-pandemic

hi all first of all i want to commemorate anybody who is on disability or has ever been on disability ptsd is a serious and potentially debilitating diagnosis depending on severity in may of 2023 i committed myself to a mental hospital i was so done with the pain with the triggers with living i did not see a future for myself i started weekly emdr therapy in may and continue to go now every week diving into a new trigger or memory every time since my progress with emdr being honest with psychiatrists and not pushing myself above my limit i have been making plans now to apply to go back and get my masters degree in social work i also have a pet betta fish that i take care of daily and he reminds me to take care of myself too my focus that was something difficult to tackle my mind went everywhere i felt stupid dumb but then i started reading reading took my mind away from everything it wasnt a drug but it was an escape eventually my logic began to return all the while i went back to work online for my dad not ideal but work i began to reach out to people i havent spoken to in years and hang out with them i thought i would be too much to handle but in reality everybody commemorated my progress i spend a lot of time at home still but i get outside i picked up a new hobby of smelling fragrances new smells that remind me of my progress i journal every night i take my medications at the same time every day i make sure to eat 3 meals a day i help out around the house of course my finances are still not the best but my finances are still better than they were previously which is progress if somebody would have told me what i am now versus may of 2023 i wouldnt believe you you can do this,post-pandemic
ive been very recently diagnosed with bpd i knew for probably three to four months before the official diagnosis that i had bpd i had many of the symptoms and when i originally told my siblings that i may have it their reaction was more so disbelief and claiming that i was just being dramatic which i thought was odd because they have complained about my behavior and my moods very very often however now that theres an official diagnosis i thought that it would fix their perception of me that i could possibly get a little bit more sympathy if my voice is flat or if i look angry or if i sound mean or if i just dont seem to be in the mood for something instead its much the same as before they assume im upset and suddenly im no longer a person i dont get talked to properly anymore anything i say is met with instant hostility they could ask me a yes or no question and either answer would lead to me being the bad guy because i couldnt brighten the tone of my voice this can go on for days its one of the main reasons i dont tend to speak when i have mood swings speaking just makes it worse ultimately i end up isolated because i look upset or i presumably act mean and its just very frustrating to have finally gotten this diagnosis thinking that theyre finally going to believe me and yet nothing has changed some research has been done on both sides ive talked to my siblings and yet im still treated as if im just a surly horrible person when instead im trying so hard every single day to be kind and show empathy and apologize when my moods get the best of me honestly it really just saddens me im actively crying and im wondering if this is me being problematic again is this me blowing things out of proportion i think its not i think i have a valid reason for wanting to be upset it just feels like certain behaviors have been learned on how to deal with me and theyre not willing to unlearn them i dont have the confidence to approach them and tell them that it hurts me because even when it does no one cares and the behavior just continues its like it doesnt click to them that theyre a part of the problem too i guess i just wanted to vent i guess i just wanted to let somebody know that im hurt so so deeply and maybe someone cares and maybe someone can give me advice and maybe someone can tell me that its not me and that im not overreacting its not always me im not always the root of the problem in fact whenever i am the problem i stick to myself and i dont speak and i dont interact with anyone because i know it makes them upset i try to regulate my mood and to go back to being happy funny and entertaining but i just cant do that sometimes i guess i just wanted to vent it honestly feels like im only wanted when im happy,post-pandemic
i dont know if i was really alcoholic but i had 2 month of drinking 5 times a week while i was really depressedi was drinking also at work or any social environment i drank on and off for couple months now i dont feel the need to drink anymore but the problem i need alcohol to communicate with people is it still fine to drink once in a whileif so how many times,post-pandemic
ive been going through this a lot over the past 5 years believing something is wrong going to my gpspecialist about it and then when they agree to test for what you think it is it actually makes the anxiety 10x worse until you actually get the results its really weird because you want to be taken seriously but then when you are it actually feeds whats going on in your head has anyone found any methods of breaking this cycle because its one i just cant seem to get out of,post-pandemic
posting from this account because i dont really use it about a year ago i wrote about how i had stopped drinking after getting acute pancreatitis im very young i wrote about my detox experience in the hospital and i received a lot of positive feedback about being sober though it was only for two weeks post my hospital experience i felt really good about myself for a long timeand then i didnt i dont know what happened or why i fell into a downward spiral but i picked up drinking again i told myself it would just be one or two drinks and then i would stop but one or two so quickly became 5 or 6 and then 5 or 6 became every day again i felt like i couldnt stop and i was so ashamed to ask anyone for help because they knew how it difficult it had been the first time and would never have thought id do it again i never thought id end up in the same place again and then in two weeks after that i was in the hospital diagnosis severe acute pancreatitis and then kidney failure and liver failure i was dying and i was detoxing yet again while dying and all i could think of was how stupid i had been how i thought i could have control and limit myself and now here i was dying of pancreatitis and organ failure at 22 because i thought i was smarter than my addiction i think a lot of people think that that theyre smarter i know now that i cant be i dont remember a lot of it i was in the hospital for 34 days and all of it was on a double dose of dilaudid which is 10x stronger than morphine for 19 days i wasnt allowed to drink water or eat anything i had shakes i had nightmares when i could sleep and hallucinations when i couldnt my heart rate was so high from detoxing and organ failure that i was put in the cardiac ward with someone checking in on me every so often to make sure i didnt croak at first all my family visited me then slowly they all stopped visiting until it was only my mom who would come during the day she would sit and cry leave and come back the next day to do the same thing i hated them for it at the time but i understood much later that it was easier for them to accept i was dying when they didnt have to look me in the eyes most of my experience was so hazy because of the pain meds i felt worthless and empty and just wanted it to be over with physically my body had given up on me and mentally i had given up about 17 days in i was tired but i couldnt sleep it was like being stuck in a fog with no lighthouse in sight i just wanted it all to end to finally die and let the tiredness take over in a different way and then it happened in some respect i still have trouble understanding it for a brief moment the fog had lifted and i heard a mans voice in my head telling me that i was going to be safe and it was time for me to fall asleep i knew what it meant because the feeling i had was like i was falling asleep but i knew i wasnt going to sleep it was borderline euphoric and all i wanted to do was grab hold of that feeling and let it wash me away but then a nurse came in it was the end of her shift she had said she wanted to know how i was feeling i told her the voice id heard in my head said its okay to fall asleep now and i was ready she asked me if i felt afraid or scared i said no i didnt have an ounce of fear in my body though if i were to think about dying now im terrified in all capacities i wasnt then i would later find out that she wouldnt have believed me if i was afraid guess it wasnt the first time shes heard something like it she sat beside my bed and started telling my stories from her shift trying to get me to laugh played rock paper scissors showed me pictures of her dog on her phone it took me a while to realize what she was even doing she wasnt making sure i wasnt alone in my last moments she was making sure i didnt fall asleep she stayed by my side for 8 hours past her shift well into the morning did everything possible to keep me awake rubbed my arms roughly or tickled my feet whenever my eyes got heavy specialists oncall finally started coming around in the morning poking and prodding me and the urge to fall asleep in that same way i had briefly felt had dissipated some level of fear had come back and i didnt want to die anymore i was terrified of it again for some reason after that day i began to improve my pancreatic enzymes went down my liver enzymes started cruising to a healthier level my kidneys started functioning better in the end i left the hospital with half a pancreas but i left with something else too some sort of new motivation to give back in life i finished college i got a job i started volunteering and giving back ive never looked at things the same way since then i feel calmer and dont have mood swings like i used to occasionally i feel the urge to drink but it dissipates as time goes on because i know that i cant fully control my addiction but i can prevent it from controlling me i still dont know who that nurse was maybe she wasnt even real sometimes i think it was god giving me one last chance but i think that without her i would have died that night it took me a long time to even talk about this to admit that i felt i had not only failed myself in sobriety but my friends and family too i struggled for so long to tell myself that i was an addict that this wasnt taboo its just college a lot of people said to me its normal to drink a lot but its not normal and its not just college young people can get addicted too and its so far from okay its so far from okay to normalize the behavior in young adults just because they are young its been a year now i havent had a single sip of alcohol and even as i type this i feel like im questioning myself if itll actually help someone but maybe it will young or old to know that they arent alone and that there are consequences for our actions maybe that there really is something out there for us beyond life that watches over us and helps us cross bridges that we dont think we can overcome i crossed a barrier that i never thought i could get past never thought i would ever be able to conquer i havent looked back x200b x200b x200b to add a short blurb to everyone reading this if you need help please get it trust me i know how hard it is to seek it but there are online platforms phone calls counselors aa meetings you name it i made the mistake of never trying to get help because like many other people i felt that i could deal with it myself or often told myself it wasnt as bad as it actually was talk to someone anyone it helps its one of the most difficult first steps to take towards getting sober but it is so so not worth the pain anxiety depression and embarrassment that i felt trying to hide it,pre-pandemic

mid 20s male who genuinely takes proper care of their appearance gets regular haircuts from the most popular barbers in my town dress in fashionable clothes always ironed wear nice aftershave look after my teeth and skin yet i get nothing im not the tallest like 510 and not the strongest either but still i cant believe im getting absolutely no action when i was 1618 years old back then i found it so much easier to get dates i went on a fair amount of dates back then and had a couple relationships but these days its a wrap for me biggest issue for me is i have quite a round facehead and for a man thats a death sentence in the dating world becuase it leaves you with a lack of a prominent jawline or angles which make your face look attractive because of this ive always been told i have a baby face which maybe makes sense why ive had no success in mid 20s compared to my teenage years as people my age now want to date someone who looks like a masculine man not someone who looks 1718 when theyre mid 20s so yeah dating sucks have barely any friends and am lonely 247 life sucks man,post-pandemic

i thought this whole one time drug usage experience for me was just on its way out but tonight ive been reminded that i might indeed have a problem and that people are just helping me not go full blown because they forced me to get rid of my pills without that who knows where wed be my roommate in college has a lot of prescription medications that i just saw on her desk one of them being adderall it seems suspicious though because theyre all full so she must not actually take them none of my business what she does with them but the point is the fact that the adderall is just sitting there was so tempting just to feel something the curiosity and urge was so strong but my mom told me i need to know youre safe and wont take anything stupid tonight and i made that promise rough night and reminded me that maybe i truly do have a problem not having the pills and being forced to flush them was both the most humiliating moment of my life and also made me very angry at myself to even be dabbling in those behaviors even if it was just one time one night one decision but all i can think about is my want for them again i want them back and thats the issue,post-pandemic

i think we all agree that we worry too much about what if and dont put enough stock into what is case in point me right now i started a few weeks ago with this feeling like i needed to pee all the time saw my doctor he did a couple tests nothing this had happened a few months ago same result he said it was likely just a stress reaction or irritation from the balanitis i was diagnosed with a couple weeks prior and there was nothing to be concerned about it mostly went away for a week or so i had my annual physical 3 weeks ago and my doctor did a full workup all the blood tests urine tests std panel the whole shebang nothing comes up aside from some elevated cholesterol not a new concern he does a physical examination as well and tells me youre a healthy person hearing that helped until it didnt fast forward a week this weird urinary frequency is back along with lower back and hip tightness and tenderness in the whole area this includes the bladder which freaks me out i also get a recurring case of balanitis doctor gives me a cream its clearing up but then i had the thought what if this is a kidney infection or something bam my mid back starts acting up this ignores the fact that my reflux is back likely because of stress and drinking coffee again which ive stopped and that i have no fever fatigue or any other signs of illness i hate this everything ive just described is something ive dealt with before and ended up being nothing remotely serious lower back pelvic and hip discomfort posture is bad and its pulling my hips in a direction they shouldnt go mid back pain reflux and gas i used to be on nexium for this and when i slouch thats right where i end up rounding my back urinary frequency went away quickly without any fuss but now its happening all at once and my mind is racing and i hate all of it the worst part is that none of it is even all that bad and the pains seem to come and go im living pretty normally and when im busy or my mind is occupied i dont even notice a lot of this but here i am afraid i have a kidney or bladder problem when i have multiple explanations on why that isnt true i apologize for that leading nowhere but i just needed to rant i was doing pretty well until last month and now in a few weeks i feel like ive totally disintegrated,pre-pandemic

the trauma is so strong that it barrages me on a daily basis i feel like i deserve to be punished for either entertaining the psychosis or trying to do things that i want to do it doesnt matter its nothing i should have ended my dads suffering when he was in icu i wasnt manipulated i came up with this disgusting delusion by myself that the safest thing i could do for my dad was keeping my distance from him when i really look at it realising it was just a lie the truth is plain he was alone for four years with brain damage probably forgetting his name his son his past if i knew that i would never have hurt him and it was just a lie then i couldve been there for him talked to him and kept his company in his dying days so he wasnt alone i hate that i believed that about myself and my dad paid the price im shut off from this i dont have permission to cry im a meaningless worthless failure and the reason life torments me is because i didnt provide my dad the same mercy of ending what he couldnt bare i deserve this i deserve it until i do enough crack to give myself permission to play a video game and ignore the endless torment,post-pandemic
being an unemployed person killed my self esteem i felt so regretful all the time and for so long made me feel i am only valid when i have a job or status because i feel like everyone cares about little wealth and fame and i felt so small as a person just to talk and try to open up and nothing really mattered to the real world i only hurted myself more,post-pandemic
im sure most of you have seen a thread earlier today about giving ourselves an ed by downloading apps looking at pro ana blogs searching thinspo thinking i want to have anorexic or maybe if i develop an ed i will lose weight and i get it its heartbreaking how many of us gone through this i have i know thats the way we tend to see it that we intentionally sought this out but did we in my opinion no we didnt because normal neurotypical people dont sit and think yeah im going to get an eating disorder today they dont stumble upon pro ana blogs and think wish i could be like that they find it sad and strange you have a predisposition in the first place eds are more than a way of eating and a body type to worship its trauma psychology socialization body image so much more than downloading tumblr and deciding to fast if you think youre less valid or that youre a wannarexic that you gave yourself this disorder just know that youre not a fake your struggle is real its not your fault,pre-pandemic
hypochondria is the worst thing to ever happen to me everyday im crippled by it i guess i just wanted to make a list of all the worst things i go through as a hypochondriac 1 seeing healthy people and wishing you were like them even though you probably are healthy but your brain is telling you youre not 2 changing daily routines based off the health issue you think you have at the time 3 changing your entire diet to become healthier for me it has been limiting carbs and sugars because im afraid of developing diabetes 4 checking your pulse all the time to make sure your heart is beating properly unfortunately for me my heart is never beating normally i have constant heart palpitations and my heart races a lot not even sure if its due to anxiety im scared its something serious 5 having very bad mental health days where you cant leave your house this happens to me a lot 6 not knowing if your symptoms are caused by anxiety or something serious this drives me absolutely insane 7 not being able to lead a normal productive for me i cant hold a job because i always fear something bad will happen to me at work and ill panic 8 being triggered by seeing things on shows or in movies for instance a man has a heart attack in the show your watching and then you freak out about having a heart attack 9 obsessively looking up symptoms and not being able to stop once you start 10 wasting a ton of money on doctors appointments only for them to say youre okay 11 being in tons of debt from going to the er because you think youre dying 12 always looking for reassurance from others obsessively asking others if they ever have the same symptoms as you so you dont feel alone these are the only ones i can think of right now but feel free to list the things you deal with as a hypochondriac im curious about what others go through,pre-pandemic

surprise i lived the water was quite a bit deeper than i thought and luckily there were no rocks or tree branches just below the surface i went headfirst so any debri would have likely killed me outright or knocked me out and caused me to drawn i still got a concussion just from the water fyi concussions suck do not recommend and after i somehow managed to not drown anyway i swam to shore holy crap was it a long cold walk home believe it or not i didnt think it was that big a deal it didnt really feel like a true suicide attempt more like it blurred the lines between self harm and suicide before the jump i had figured a 90 chance id live if the water was deep i was gambling a lot on that if when i got home i told my family thinking they would just let me go to sleep with some asprin maybe take the next day off nope not a chance we went straight to the er then i was volunteered to go to the inpatient psychiatric unit the psych ward i was pretty terrified i didnt think i was worthy of such care my issues were mild werent they it was just extreme self harm i spent five days in the hospital and frankly they were some of the most incredible days ive ever experienced in my life i dealt with both extreme pain and euphoria at several points i was the hysterical crying inconsolable woman who youd expect to find in a padded room wearing a straight jacket but they didnt do that to me they talked to me and they helped me they gave me the mental and emotional tools to help myself somehow they got me to admit that i wanted to live even though i desperately believed i didnt deserve to im trying to remember every minute of every day that i do deserve to live anyway thats kinda my little story tldr jumped off a bridge landed in a psych ward got legit help edit wow thanks for the support everyone ill try to answer your questions in more detail when i get a chance edit 2 this got a bit more attention than i thought but im glad if this enourages even one person to consider asking for help or joining an inpatient phsyciatric program ill be overjoyed,pre-pandemic

had such a horrible night after nearly a year of not having social anxiety i had a massive flare up last night with some friends feel so embarrassed as i lost my confidence within a matter of hours the overall feeling was that i have to perform my jokes have to land and if they dont i criticise myself what is so strange is that the social anxiety only comes about when i see these friends the experience in itself is traumatic the worse experience is the shame that comes after it its almost making me consider having a break from seeing these friends as im already anxious i will have a flare up again it really sucks im sure other people have been going through similar experiences and hope you guys are okay if anyone has had a similar experience and want to let me know how you dealt with it would be much appreciated x200b,post-pandemic

hey everyone ive been grappling with severe anxiety and its close companion depression for as long as i can remember its a struggle thats deeply personal yet widely shared among many of us i cant claim to fully understand each of your unique journeys but i know the weight of the mental health battles we face every single day in my quest for understanding and communication ive embarked on a project that i believe could make a difference not just for me but for countless others who find it challenging to articulate their inner struggles or initiate conversations with their loved ones about their mental health im building a website that serves as a platform for anonymous letters delving into various aspects of mental healthfrom anxiety and depression to ptsd ocd and the journey of abuse recovery each letter shares the raw unfiltered experiences of individuals navigating these turbulent waters offering insight into what its truly like to live with these conditions day in and day out the idea came from my own frustration in trying to explain my experiences to my spouse despite scouring the internet i couldnt find anything that encapsulated my daily battles succinctly enough to share with her thats when it hit mei needed to create that resource myself this website isnt just about providing information its about fostering understanding and empathy its about giving voice to the silent struggles so many of us endure behind closed doors by sharing our stories anonymously we can break down barriers normalize conversations about mental health and possibly begin to heal in ways we never thought possible im still in the early stages of building this platform but my vision is expansive i want it to be a beacon of hope and solidarity for all of us a sanctuary where our stories can find resonance and our voices can be heard so im reaching out to you the reddit community to gauge your interest and gather your input is this something youd find valuable is it a venture worth pursuing im open to all feedback and suggestions if youd like to learn more or contribute your own story to the website please dont hesitate to reach out together lets shine a light on the shadows of mental health and embark on a journey of understanding and healing feel free to drop a comment or message me for further details or to share your thoughts thanks for considering this endeavor with me,post-pandemic

hey fairly new to reddit been diagnosed since i was a teenager with schizophrenia that calmed down alot from my age 2024 i am now 28 and experiencing a recurring theme from my teenage years of extremely violent intrusive thoughts mixed with mind people telling me messed up ways of being violent i have never been convinced to be violent from my schz when it gets bad ill be swearing and begging them to stop instead of a mental breakdown or being violent how would i go about dealing with this i self harmed as a teenager but i dont think thats a much better solution,post-pandemic
im currently addicted to weed this is not a very difficult addiction to live with since i dont experience physical symptoms of withdrawal at all what makes me come back to weed every time is just a mental desire that i cant resist my life is miserable bpd heavy childhood trauma and thc definitely doesnt help i have always identified as an intelligent person and it terrifies me to se myself progressively get more and more stupid and lazy i went to psychologist she refused to give me help unless i go to rehab she didnt seem very competent but im not able to find a better psychologist since she was the only option covered by my insurance and i cant afford private therapy i feel like a meeting with a good specialist once a week would be enough to help me kick this strictly behavioural addiction but i cant get it i identify more as an politoxicomaniac than thc addict since ive done plenty of substances in the past and loved almost all of them even though my use had terrible consequences i also come from a long line of addicts everyone in my family was addicted never done opiates tho since i realise that its too easy to get into physical dependence and i was always scared of it not anymore rehab seems like the only way to go since i wanna live a substancefree life but i just cant do it but i dont wanna go to rehab simply because i smoke too much weed it just seems dumb i feel like i need to become a proper addict first one who experiences physical wd symptoms and also one who go to experience a really good time before getting clean im gonna sign up for rehab wait some time for a place in one and during that waiting period have some amazing time on opiates why not if im gonna end up on rehab anyway this might be my addicted brain talking im gonna get sober i only need to get fucked first opiate addiction might me more difficult to kick than weed addiction but if rehab is my only option of getting any kind of help then i might as well go there more addicted than i already am,post-pandemic
mine was that having constant content warning suicidal thoughts were completely normal even if its practically all i could think about from when i woke up to when i went to bed it got to the point where i had to have my mom pick me up cause i couldnt walk two blocks without thinking about jumping infront of a car edit i just want to point out that this post has been getting downvotes and i would like to offer a reason why this question is important degrees do not mean that everything a doctor says is correct there are surgeons who kill patients anesthesiologists who put people under while theyre still conscious and they can still feel all of the pain psychiatrists who push benzos purely because pharmaceutical companies paid them to and psychologists who are unaware of manic episodes and their intensities so they support grandiose ideas as just depression being alleviated professionals make mistakes but in this field mistakes cost people lives if your doctor isnt right for you find a new one there are psychs who are helpful and good and amazing it takes time,pre-pandemic

a week ago my boyfriend went into severe withdrawals after trying to quit cold turkey and landed in the icu for a couple of days they said he would have certainly died if he wasnt brought in on time anyway since hes been home hes a lot more calm now and im not sure if its because he still feels a little sore and not 100 yet or because thats just how he is now that hes sober i realized ive never known him sober despite being with him for the past year its weird to think about really i have also decided to quit drinking along with him mostly because i dont want to trigger him but also because i realized how unhealthy my own drinking habits were because of this i dont feel like im exactly the same person as before either i mean hes still himself in most ways theres just been a slight shift in his personality that ive noticed which was to be expected now that hes not drunk all the time but this all made me wonder if the dynamic of the relationship has ever completely changed for anyone else,post-pandemic
as an addict anything good often temporary becomes a vice for example giving up the moment you step back from a stressful situation and decide to walk away the immediate sensation of relief is addictive it may start with more consequential things ending a toxic relationship or quitting a shitty job then it snakes down to those less crucial not attending a party or dismissing an application until finally you give up on going outside getting dressed eating healthy having friends exercising the quality of your life is drowned by the pleasure of allowing yourself to do nothing what started as youprotecting yourself from stressful situations has evolved into giving up on life,pre-pandemic

i had a really rough childhood putting it lightly but when i was 16 my mom got arrested and from that point i feel like a different person i see myself as someone completely separate from kid me when i have a nightmare im watching from a third point of view and when im telling someone about what happened i talk like it happened to someone else i use she and her not i and me i feel like i have a set of memories from before my mom got arrested and after its a really big big disconnect i dont think i explained this very well but ive been thinking for 10 minutes and i dont know how to describe it better does anyone else have similar feelings how did you overcome this i dont like having 2 different versions of myself especially because of how much my trauma impacts my life framing it in my mind like it didnt happen to me kind of makes me invalidate myself which is really dumb but brains are weird,post-pandemic

today i am 4 months sober ahhhhthat feels amazing to say because for some reason i have mostly kept my sobriety to myself im not sure if its because i dont want people to be weird about it or perhaps i dont feel like answering peoples questions as to why i have chosen to pursue an alcohol free existence but either way only a select few people are aware of my life change over the years i had progressively sunk deeper and deeper into the darkness of alcoholism and a turn of fate put me in a position to make a choice and although it has been a very hard path each af day seems a little bit brighter i just wanted to tell somebody that is all thanks for listening,pre-pandemic

hey there just wanted to pass by and remind you guys of a few things exercising will make your heart rate go up its normal climbing stairs having sex walking even standing up in a bus can make you feel tired and give you muscle pain if you arent used to exercise dont stop exercising because of those symptoms youre supposed to feel them at first and its more natural to the body if you exercise than if you dont unless you have a debilitating disease which is rare and still can exercise with medical monitoring headaches can be caused by lack of sleep too much sleep not drinking enough water clenching your teeth alcohol too much noise or bright lights and anxiety speaking of anxiety it can give you so many symptoms there are lists on the internet to check them but since googling is not very nice for people here ill give you some rapid heartbeats cold on body extremities palpitation trembling hands dizziness sensation of tingling or numbness wish to cry or run away twitching stomach pains diarrhea or constipation bloating restless legs the list goes on if you took a vaccine and your arm feels warm and kind of swollen thats a normal reaction feeling some cold symptoms too also some vaccines last for 10 years so if youve taken the tetanus one for example five years ago dont worry about tetanus its not that easy to catch hiv you dont catch it by oral sex you dont catch it by wearing condoms if you take a lot of tests afterwards on the right time and they come all negative you dont have it those kind of tests are more reliable than symptoms tetanus doesnt just come from rusty things youd have to get a really deep cut to get it brain eating bacteria is extremely rare and wont be on your tap water throwing up is a natural response and means your body is fighting something bad dont force yourself to stop it you need to be penetrated without a protection to get pregnant periods can be irregular some paint or fume wont give you problems or kill you cats and dogs who have their vaccines and anti fungicide and live inside houses wont give you anything scratches hurt and theyre supposed to get a bit swollen afterwards after getting a cold or the flu you will feel tired your body was combating something you are supposed to feel a bit tired afterwards just remember to keep yourself hydrated to rest and eat something simple your body isnt perfect and our diets arent either sometimes your poop will be different medicine recovering from an infection different foods stress and lack of water can change the shape and color of it just remember to eat as well as possible because your intestine is your second brain as in it will help you combat against anxiety or depression you cant control someone elses life im sorry but as much as you worry about them you cant watch them every minute of their day it wont stop them from getting hurt or sick the best way to deal with anxiety for others is simply helping them emotionally as much as they need and go to therapy yourself google will give you terrible diseases for your symptoms because it has to and it wants you to keep searching for things trust doctors trust the data some diseases mainly neurological are extremely rare and googling it wont solve anything everytime you feel the need to be reassured try instead helping someone here by replying to some posts going for a walk focusing on things you see around you or talk to someone anything other than health issues also try avoiding sugary drinks and if your birth control pills arent workinggiving you bad symptoms for a while go to a gynecologist to change them by washing your hands cleaning your vegetables eating well having good hygiene exercising going to the ophthalmologist once a year or once every two years having protected sex and sleeping well you will be avoiding most sickness you can seriously youre doing way more than most people in the world and even without those people live a lot so will you so remember you can be afraid of getting hit by a car and look at both sides to cross the street to avoid it but dont be so afraid that it stops you from crossing it at all connect with your family talk to your friends try to look out for therapy party study but please dont let ha eat you alive dont stop doing things because youre afraid of getting sick do whatever you can to escape it as hard as it is and remember progress isnt linear and thats okay youll all be fine and sorry for any mistakes english is not my first language,pre-pandemic

so basically yesterday i had a tini mini making out session with a boy it was one of these spicy ones with loosing shirts and my bra and idk i heard some nice things and enjoyed the whole event but also i had at the back of my mind that i look how i look and my looks are not desirable and im so sorry for him that i had to be his first girl who he saw almost nakey i couldnt really think about anything but that my stomach and boobs and my thighs and even if he was keep telling me that im pretty etc couldnt believe that lmao idk if i should talk to him about that or not since like would it change much with honorable metion that it was very adorbale how he didnt knew what to exactly do and keept calling me cute names,post-pandemic
ive been doing remote jobs only for past 4 years because i get nausea and frequent urination from social anxiety i had a short internship and there were only a few days when i felt nauseous but i struggled with the frequent urination every day what helps with these has anybody found anything that helps i know both are fight or flight symptoms but i just cant make the fight or flight state end at the workplace ive been to therapy but i just genuinely fear other people or actually that i seem crazy or weird to them in any way so i know the root cause for my anxiety but im just stuck at it i cant get over the fear of making a fool of myself and social anxiety symptoms themself just increase that fear because getting nauseous or running back and forth to toilet in front of possible work mates is just one thing more to make me embarrass myself i know some people dont find it embarrassing although i think the running to toilet all the time will 100 be found weird and i shouldnt either but i cant help it ive been bullied at school and humiliated at my former job so all social situations just are challenging to me to bear now i can still act pretty normally besides those two overbearing symptoms and i bet most people wouldnt even believe i even have social anxiety cause i mask it so well and can be very chatty but its bad it really is,post-pandemic
my husband has struggled with alcohol addiction for the last 4 years the problem is besides his drinking is that you could consider him highfunctioning alcoholic he can drink all night and still gets up to go to work the next day or hell only drink 3 beers daily but its a 5050 shot that hell end up binging and blacking out hes gotten in legal trouble for dwi before and we have not had a healthy happy relationship because of who hes become when hes not drinking hes addicted to his phone like he cant be present and face who he is on a daily basis he recently is in legal trouble for another incident that happened when he was sober although i suspect withdrawal was in play because it had been 2 days since his last drink im just wondering how low is low enough when will he come to his senses and realize the alcohol isnt worth it how much worse do things have to get im looking to hear others experiences on what helped them realize it was time to get sober,post-pandemic

i get having a favourite person disassociation abandonment issues no sense of identityetc but in some ways its so much more than just the nine or so symptoms in the dsm thats almost too simple someone just reading the dsm could never understanding exactly how far reaching and invasive this disorder actually is i think my friends think im a bit lost and emotionally a bit manic they think im a little highly strung or simply hyper they think my existence is like the stereotypical manic pixie dream girl a little troubled but interesting the extent of the mess is hidden and i dont know if i want them to know more they dont know about so many things how i had a meltdown the other night because i couldnt braid my hair right at 1230am in the morning cried and wanted to throw things like a child the way i get so pent up on one emotion and too obsessed overthinking to the point where i bite myself or grab the nearest sharp object to simply release some of this energy the paranoia how actually genuinely crazy i am thinking everyone hates me is talking about me and then the extreme like thinking cameras are in my room how suspicious i am of them and how my opinion of them constantly changes how i can love them so much one minute then resent their existence the next how everything takes so much effort how even focussing on one task takes so much energy because my head never shuts the fuck up to what extent i cant enjoy basic socialising because i disassociate and have to go to the toilet to ground myself how shaky my identity is to the point that changing my clothes makes me feel like a different person how can you know me if i dont how nowhere feels like home nowhere can be yours if you are no one how i want to rage and scream and cry and then laugh and shout with joy and how quickly i flick how every piece of affirmation and compliment defines my short term personality and makes my day but also how every slight perceived rejection makes me spiral and hate myself how hard everyday activities are because if they dont go right again i switch and spiral i feel so much joy but also so much sadness so much of my energy is used just keeping the base of my life intact but add any strains and it cracks then all of a sudden im crying in my kitchen accusing my best friend of hating me sometimes i want to die because i cannot cope sometimes i love life because its amazing but most of the time im just exhausted from all of this i know it can get better and im seeing a therapist and doing dbt i eat well and exercise and put all my energy into keeping the axes of my life stable all of that leaves me drained and then i fall into bed and i cannot fucking sleep edit i posted this as a rant i wrote during a lecture and never expected so many comments i will try and reply to all of them tomorrow but i appreciate all of them thank you,pre-pandemic
tldr im too mentally ill to function and my life is in a bad place i want to know how to not be hopeless even though realistically nothing will get better i have bipolar disorder and often experience severe bouts of depression because of this my life has become pretty limitedi have to do freelancegig work because it offers flexibility but it doesnt bring in enough money my house is a mess because i struggle to clean it my personal hygiene is poor because i struggle to take care of myself i dont do any work on my skillset so i could pursue different work i dont read anymore i dont work on creative projects that are meaningful to me i dont have friends because i dont go out i feel like im stuck at the maturity level i was at when i first started experiencing symptoms at 16 im 32 now ive had some traumatic things happen over that time that have made the depression worse i hate my life and i dont see how it can get better when im at the level of functioning i am at ive tried everything to alleviate my symptoms i see a therapist weekly a psychiatrist every 3 months im currently taking multiple psych meds and have been on a wide variety of different ones i did transcranial magnetic stimulation it didnt help and ketamine therapy helped but got too expensive when i try to do more than i am capable of i inevitably fail to get what i intended or wanted to done i might have a burst of good feelings and productivity now and then but this isnt consistent and i usually end up starting projects that i never finish only doing what i am capable of isnt enough because i am capable of so little i dont have any help i feel like my therapist is supportive but i only see her an hour a week on a day to day level i am alone with all my problems i cant afford to hire anyone to do household stuff i dont know how to not be paralyzed by hopelessness when this is as good as life will be for me based on my level of functionality ive talked to my therapist about this and i think shes too optimistic about my capabilities ill tell her im struggling and only got one thing done and shell praise me for the one thing i got done but doesnt seem to understand how all the things i didnt get done impact mementally and in a more literal wayi didnt do laundry so im sad that wasnt able to but also i dont have clean clothes so i feel really self conscious and gross or i was late on a freelance deadline so i reduced the price now i dont have money i need so now i have to starve or skip a bill these things i fail to do are more than upsetting they affect my life in a real way the way im going my life will only get worse i dont function well enough to pull myself out of the depression im in the condition my house is in the condition of my finances my loneliness etc if im being realistic there is no hope for me of having a better life so whats the point,post-pandemic

umm i thought thats what i was doing but now i feel kind of stupid guess i wont try that again edit hey just to clarify a couple things im seeing quite a few comments along the lines of dont treat people like emotional dumpsters you need a therapist for stuff like that youre making them feel burdened i hear you loud and clear but im talking more about normal just sharing what you are going through with your friends im learning that not all friends want that and i understand but its still tough to hear when its a pattern if you have any specific advice im open to hear it but please be careful how you word things this is a mental health subreddit so ill give you 2 guesses as to how im doing emotionally edit 2 i hate doing edits but felt the need to clarify this after one specific comment after my acquaintancefriend person said this i remained kind to them i dont dislike them at all and dont judge them i respect they have boundaries i simply thought we had a different relationship which if you have bpd im sure you can relate to please dont think i am here to blame or complain about how evil people are i just thought this subreddit would understand that feeling of making this mistake,pre-pandemic

so i have major ha and its mainly centered around heart issues im 100 convinced my panic attacks are heart attacks will deal with palpitations even though every cardiologist ever has said im fine etc etc yall know the drill i am constantly running to the doctor because i just know something is wrong with my heart and he tests me for everything and always says theres literally nothing wrong here so yesterday i was headed to brunch with some friends my chest starts hurting i start panicking i convinced myself that this was a heart attack since i have no anxiety whatsoever about seeing my besties for mimosas i tried to distract myself by laughing and joking with my friends and quietly tried to accept my fate that i will indeed die on this day from a heart attack luckily it was a short drive and we arrived at the restaurant before these thoughts could culminate more it wasnt until i got home that i realized the pain went away and i hadnt even thought about it since arriving at the restaurant the distractions of talking about the next episode of game of thrones gossiping about celeb scandals and trying to figure out which omelette to order had totally distracted me its experiences like these that show me just how anxious i really amhow strong my anxiety truly is its present when i dont even think it has a reason to be i wasnt having a heart attacki was having anxiety still dont know why as i was genuinely looking forward to brunch but thats just another thing i need to work through and understand my subconscious anxiety is causing these scary sensations those palpitations that come out of no where thats anxiety sharp chest pains that occur when im sitting down watching tv anxiety i dont have to be faced with a typical anxietyinducing event to struggle with the side effects of this disease sorry if this is obvious to everyone else but i hadnt really come to grips with this until yesterday felt like a huge realization for me and wanted to share in case it helps someone else,pre-pandemic

you might have seen my comment before on going for a diagnosis and the psychiatrist not asking many questions and just focusing on fidgeting and focus as the only symptoms and saying my focus is bad just because of my weight because i dont fidget cut me off when i went to mention how ive masked my fidgeting i was and still am in shock and furious on this and i cant get a second opinion as he is the only adult diagnoser without going private i still need see how to report him but ive been at a councillor and they are 100 i have adhd without me even mentioning told them about the psychiatrist and they were shocked but they made a good point why do i need the diagnosis for me it is recognition but people here recognized it the first assessor she even asked if i think im dyslexic recognized i have it the councillor recognized it and i recognize i have it i know theres some negatives of people using and abusing it but then theres those that know something is wrong and want that confirmation and sometimes personal confirmation is enough its still hard as my mind wonders and wants that professional confirmation but i just need to remember i know me better than anyone else,post-pandemic

heya i wanna begin by saying that this is a throwaway as i dont want to reveal all this on my main account im 17 going to turn 18 in about 6 months ive been struggling on and off since i was 13 with addiction to drugs initially it started with me taking my fathers alprazolam xanax when i was around 13 of course he did not know along with his marijuana alongside dxm use when i could get it i was going through a pretty rough time because my parents had just divorced i lived with my father alone and we were dirt when we got through paying for the essentials i had felt that because of my circumstances i should take drugs this simply was because this was the pattern i observed from others and as a 13 year old who wanted to be like everybody else i decided that i should do this too the first drug i ever took was 2mg of xanax at age 1213 dont remember specifically that i had taken from my fathers medicine i fell in love with it over time from 1215 i did various drugs off and on namely xanax dxm weed and i believe klonopin one time maybe it was because of my limited access to these drugs but for some reason i always kept a habit of not redosing and waiting inbetween dosages i was relatively responsible this i think is because even at 12 i forced myself to do at least 3 days of research into what i was going to be taking before i took it so i had already learned about the principles of safety when it came to drugs x200b anyway right now is what im concerned about im 17 now and for some reason my care about my own safety and habitual use has just disappeared i just feel confused i really cant remember when i started to seriously get addicted to generally substances in general but i think it was about 4 months ago i now have the mentality of ill take whatever fucks me up and i feel like im just watching myself do these things i got my hands on 1mg of xanax again recently and i took it and for 4 days straight after i could only think about how much i wanted to get more xanax how nice it would be for me to be able to have that every day and be in that reality every day i think a lot of my addiction to substances in general is coming from that i just dont like reality i dont know why i have a hard time putting a reason to it but i know that every time after i use something that feeling of discontent with reality just grows and grows when im sober im very clearheaded and relatively upbeat but for the past 4 months almost everyday my brain has felt foggy i feel sick almost everyday that ive just gotten used to it all i can think about a lot of days is drugs where can i get the money for my next drugs what could fuck me up the most should i combine x and y fuck i hate what im becoming and its really scaring me x200b my main concern is that ive just lost care for everything its been really hard for me to even care about my drug use and generally anything i just feel lethargic all day i just want to lay in bed and be high and not be in reality anymore i stopped caring if i got addicted and thats the scariest thing to me i know that if i continue down this road i will die but i dont know what to do its fucking horrifying man none of my family knows i manage to keep a relatively wellkept profile on the outside and most people consider me to just be pretty normal but im scared man,post-pandemic

i have three things on my mind relatively constantly first is dealing with adhd in the work force i have been burned a couple times by the spicy part of my mentality i have spent a great deal of time focused on trying to really wrap my head around what makes me tick i notice that no matter how much i force curiosity to come first to confusion it seems like anger and frustration come first i know putting things in perspective helps and that is where the curiosity comes into play but so often i just become frustrated second headaches i think of all the areas in my health this is probably the one where i gaslight myself the most i tell myself that i must have let my mind wander into territory it wasnt supposed to be in and then i am stuck there trying to ride out the headache i have not really found any pattern with where these come from but my gut keeps telling me it is a form of mental whiplash for what it is worth this has been an issue for me for quite some time on adderall and vyvanse third is trying to find my tribe as many folks with autisticadhdetc mind tend to do i have a few interests that have become my go to for relaxation the one that i feel has the most promise though for this is photography i actually dont believe in posting photos from anyone else but myself especially to reddit so it is all oc a while ago i lost both discord servers that i used to frequent for reasons that i dont even recall today and i miss the friends that i had garnered through those servers hell one was an irc server that turned to discord when it became popular to have it if you made it this far thank you i appreciate the time you spent reading my random thoughts,post-pandemic
5 years ago i was in a very very bad place i was grossly overweight depressed drinking to blackout alone most days quitting was horrible the first year wasnt all that great but things slowly improved over time im not trying to brag about my 5 years or anything im just taking a moment to reflect on how shit things were at the end of my drinking and how much better a sober life is for anyone struggling i wish you all the very best quitting and staying quit is hard but will probably be the best thing you will ever do for yourself,pre-pandemic

people say oh let me help you i say no thanks i know how that goes they insist yes let me help you so i say fine heres the deal and then they say oh my god youre too much and they blame me and disappear i feel worse than when we started repeat times 12 its really hard to lose faith in people it seems much easier just to stay on my own but they say not to isolate maybe get a dog thoughts this really is the worst it really is so old they never believe me they always insist over and over sometimes the same people sometimes different ones,post-pandemic
i could always acknowledge that i had some bad experiences in my childhood my mom was bipolar an alcoholic and addict my dad traveled for work and when he was home he ignored what was happening i spent most of my childhood being the protector of my younger brother anyway ive had anxiety and depression my whole life as far back as i can remember but this past year it has been particularly bad inpatient stays outpatient therapy etc a few weeks ago i started having flashbacks and my mind just cant stop thinking of the things that happened ive been angry at first it was towards my mom but lately i just feel angry at myself i think things like did this even happen why am i making such a big deal out of this do i just want attention do i just want to feel bad for myself i didnt know exactly what was causing my anxiety and depression so have i just resorted to blaming it on my childhood was it even that bad i just need to suck it up stop thinking about it its over and im fine has anyone else had this experience i am in therapy but the cptsd symptoms have only recently manifested so im very new to this and so far i guess i just dont feel like any of this is valid,pre-pandemic
hi there i often have the feeling that i am not fully presentalert especially with other people it comes and goes and i am not sure what it is it is just like i am behind a cloud in this mode i also have difficulties interacting with other people like looking them into the eyes or having a normal conversation i think i make the impression of being weird to them for example sales people in shops but also with friends relatives etc especially when i am not stimulated and dont know what i should be doing interestingly when i am at home i do not feel this feeling it seems like my brain is trying to process the world and its simply too much likewise when i am on vyvanse which i am currently trying to adjust to not too easy due to anxiety issues this all goes away and i am a super talkative social person with a very positive outlook for life not saying that i am depressed otherwise but it just removes some barriersfog that i until not long ago did not know existed can anyone relate to this people say what i experience might be called dissociation but when reading about it i think thats a way too extreme description,post-pandemic

alcoholic sex and drug addict here beginning to recover on my own id probably say the hardest part of being sober and trying to make the right decision is just staying home and being with your own invasive thoughts my life style for the past fifteen years was all drugs and alchohol and now that ive decided to go sober im really just left twiddling my thumbs with with my own thoughts at home its just driving me nuts i need an outlet for my energy one that doesnt make me think and think and think,post-pandemic
i feel like a goddamn loser no one ever talks to me i have a coworker that i hang out with along with her fiance on the weekends but thats about it nobody else makes an effort to talk to me or hang out and its fucking embarrassing and for the record im fairly young but i work a fulltime job and dont have time to go around meeting other people im not in school either it feels so isolating i also cant bring myself to connect to any old friends those relationships died a long time ago and i hate that i couldnt care less its confusing i crave company but the work to maintain something real is exhausting people disappoint me all the time i disappoint me im a walking paradox,post-pandemic

lately like for the past 3 months my emotions have been very faint to me other than humor and boredom everything else isnt as strong as it used to be like usually when something happens that usually triggers my bpd id feel it strongly in my palms or chest but now its like i dont feel the emotion but i still have the thought process which ive been learned to ignore and process what happens to me in different ways for example recently ive been having the thought process of like feeling unloved and bad but i dont feel that emotion in my chest or palms and more so is just thinking about it my boyfriend was basically confessed too on valentines day something weve never really done and instead of letting them know they have girlfriend he says to me im gonna play dumb this triggered bpd induced dreams where i literally dream hes cheating on me its like haunting me when i vented to them about it it wasnt even coherent and they didnt really comfort me i lost my mind in my head but i didnt feel anything at the time i also went to a mitski concert recently and realized that i can only process my emotions if im listening to music which is a semi recent thing but i texted my boyfriend something heartfelt and they didnt even reply they just said i and moved on i know i should communicate some of these things but i fear its not even worth it i just have to move on too that on top of dealing with racists at my job college anxiety and general world problems i feel myself like becoming numb i had like a coping mechanism which wasnt that healthy but it worked it wasnt drugs but nowadays im finding it boring im finding games boring and all i find myself wanting to do is eat and sleep i think me feeling numb stems from my childhood to now honestly ive never in my entire life experienced any kind of healthy relationship whether friends or family or romantic my moms relationships in the past were horrible and her trust issues grew onto me my family is so broken its beyond even trying to repair i mostly just wanna stay in touch with my sister and my mom as a kid whenever bad shit would happen to me or in general i would force myself to not feel anything like numb my emotions it was proly based off something i saw online but it was always my go to and i was always using escapism like maladaptive daydreaming or hyperfixiating on books the hyperfixiating was literally unhealthy too i would just not move so now in present time having to continue dealing with bullshit in different fonts i kind of reverted back to some of my old habits unconciously like i cant daydream that much anymore but i defintely numbed my emotions cause everything just feels so faint granted it could be depression but i usually feel that intense sadness or pain which i dont really feel its definetly there but its not physically hurting me im just thinking about it nowadays ive truly only found comfort in my sister since weve been hanging out alot more and theyve been opening up to me more but i cant hangout with my sister all the time nor do i want to be reliant on her since im the older sister and i want to be the one to help her instead i just really wish things were more clear and i wasnt so delusional,post-pandemic

exactly as it sounds left the house with my boyfriend on tuesday to buy groceries which to him means poptarts frozen pizzas and cookies somewhere along the literally 5 minute drive we started talking about cats i said i wished i could pet a cat because i was so stressed from school so then we stopped at pet smart to pet the cats as we were walking inside my boyfriend said i hate cats so we are not getting one we are only petting them this is a destress trip to pet cats and that is it within 5 minutes of petting the cats my boyfriend was hand selected by a big fat male tabby who stuck his paw through the cage and gently tapped him on the ear i look over a few minutes later and he has this big cat cradled in his arms telling me we have to have him so now we have a cat and its been 3 days and we never returned to the grocery store for the junk food run and im thankful for this because now i get to go to the grocery store by myself today and select all the good and healthy foods i want without his influence i was literally saved from junk food by this cat edited to add photo,pre-pandemic
so honestly my adhd meds make me happy im calm no anxiety no social anxiety and just happy like everything became lighter when i started taking my adhd meds my life has seriously improved with these meds and not just doing things and staying on task but mentally my life has been better i can just feel happy instead of an endless void inside me i used to rely so heavily on wd to make me happy and now i barely smoke and its not like im getting a high its not like im drunk or anything im just chilled out and happy but heres the thing i purposely dont take my adhd meds everyday because i dont want my body to build a tolerance and stop making me happy and social i know some people say its better to take them everyday so you dont get used to those happy effects but i purposely dont do think because i dont want to be used to that feeling and give it away its not like id ever take more then i should or even up the dose but i just purposely dont get used to it so i can have that happy feeling is that okay is that wrong is it unhealthy,post-pandemic

my boyfriend has health anxiety and i keep getting upset about it my boyfriend 17m and i 16f have been dating for 9 months i truly believe i have found the love of my life and i want to be able to help him with any issues he has however i grew up very isolated my sister takes up my parents time and when they do talk to me i walk on eggshells so they dont snap i never had good friends so thats the only behaviour i learned whenever my boyfriend comes to me with a health anxiety concern i get frustrated at him and respond how my parents would i desperately want to fix that my boyfriend has had health anxiety more specifically illness anxiety disorder for the past 7 years after a choking incident no matter what he always has a worry in his head about his health most of the time its about bacterial things like meningitis or sepsis but he also often worries about small things like whether a pinsized cut is infected or more rare conditions i also used to research poisons was writing a book for class and have memorized the flavours of a few so everytime my boyfriend eats something he asks me to sample it even when its something i dislike to which i always oblige i hate to say it but sometimes i find his worries to be very strange since im the kind of person to just let a cut bleed dry and leave it at the beginning of our relationship i was more than understanding i would often spend my nights researching conditions that he believed he had finding loopholes to show him he didnt have the conditions he thought he did recently however i find myself snapping at him rather that offering comfort i dont snap at him out of frustration that hes talking to me about his issues rather that i dont know how to properly help him my methods of researching conditions wasnt working offering comfort in a hug barely comforted him and now im lost and whenever he asks me for help i simply get frustrated and tell him im not a doctor and would have no way of knowing i know this hurts him and i want to do better please help me,post-pandemic

so im going to flunk out of college its alright im in the final stage of grief about it acceptance so i dont need your kind words although thank you kindly if do you post something caring my kind the workingclass dont belong in university anyway its our lot in life to fix the ferraris grow the champagne grapes and erect the mansions of those who do go to college i accept its my fault i failed i just cant stay sitting still reading books for hours on end my body wants to be out in nature and my hands have to be doing something exploring creating and building things thats what i was born for not memorizing rote but theres one thing i felt was unfair using adderall ritalin and other adhd meds to get ahead was an open secret at my university even though in my country new zealand its a controlled substance and illegal to possess without a prescription the college authorities turned a blind eye to it the lab tutors phd students postdocs boasted about popping it whenever they needed a journal paper to write right before deadline and one told us to thank adderall not his supervisor for him getting his phd incredible focus unflagging energy amazing powers of recall and connectionforming in the mind everyone knew thats what adderall would give you and for the right price there were people on campus that would supply you you should have seen the place around cram time exams you could see the medicine bottles in the bins and the people taking their pills when they sat down in the library i dont know if i would have got my degree if i had partaken but i didnt people were selling sure but i wasnt rich enough and im now failing my courses it probably is because im neither smart nor dedicated enough for university id rather get lost in my cups than lost in a book but still how is it fair how is it ethical how is it responsible that universities basically encourage performanceenhancing drugs in the form of adderall abuse,pre-pandemic

i love my boyfriend very much we are planning on getting married next year last monday i had a weird feeling that something was up and got anxious before he left the house in the afternoon he shaved his pubes and showered and i immediately got suspicious but tried to calm myself down after he had left i texted him what he would do if somebody tried to flirt with him he said he wouldnt engage cause he would feel like micro cheating on me and got quite angry that i would even dare to ask he came home in the evening saying that he got hard today thinking of me and that there was a little precum stain in his underwear from that i found that highly unlikely and confusing and acuses him of lying he then got really angry blaming it on my low self esteem that i wouldnt even accept a compliment like that later that evening i asked him to go through his phone and found spicy messages of him and a girl i confronted him we fought he didnt admit at this point that they met in person only when i contacted her the next day i found out bit by bit that he was at this girls place and they had made out on her couch they did not have sex nor did they get naked he said she grinded on him and they kissed we have been fighting and discussing this over the last couple of days he got physically abusive and threw stuff around said hurtful things but i managed to stay calm and at some point we had a real deep talk about his past and his current behaviour he seemed really honest and regretful he also said that he tends to fuck up everything that means something to him and that i am the best thing that ever happened to him we said we would go to couples therapy and i signed us up yesterday i do love him very much but i am still shocked about the way he was able to lie to me to my face like that i told him from the beginning that being lied and cheated to is something i am very afraid of and we agreed that if we have the need to cheat we would talk about it beforehand that he broke our agreement like that is devastating my question to you is are there pwbpd that have successfully stopped cheating on their partners and how did they do it do you love your partners is there anything i can do to make him less likely to do it again should i just convince myself to let him cheat and open up the relationship i dont know what to do i have the constant need to talk about it and i still dont fully believe they didnt have sex or that this is the full story i would be very glad about any sort of advice cause i have no one to talk to,post-pandemic
hello english is not my first language this is going to sound soooo weird haha ive just been thinking about this today i just want to make it clear that i dont mean if its physically possible cuz ofc it is what i mean is if you guys feel like you could achieve this if you wanted to when i say ripped i mean that kind of body that takes years of consistent hard work and diet from my perspective i can personally only work out consistently for a couple of months before something happens and i have to take a break for weeks or months before going back things that can happen that makes me take a break depressionanxiety death in the family stressed out cuz i havent been able to do any of my special interests for 12 weeks due to workdoing stuffgym vacation or any other thing that disrupt my routine i also have trouble with eating when i train i want to eat 34 times a day to make gains but i normally only eat 12 times a day so that also makes it hard to keep up the routine and then the famous sleeping problems sleeping is so important when the body is recovering but yea i cannot sleep 8h per night every night can any of u without medicine ive come to accept that i cannot achieve this cool ripped female body that i would like to have i love to feel strong but i just cant be consistent with gym food and sleep for several years on endthat is okey tho but im jelous of all the nts that make it look so easy when i finally make progress i have to take a break like i said earlier i can also add that im that person that never gets a break in life from bad things to happen it has taken a year for me to come back after a family members suicide and now that im feeling better my old cat my bestie is getting weaker and has not so long left like how can anyone have things like this happen and still be mentally stable to work out,post-pandemic
my voices sometimes say something and then it happens in the future like i asked my mum a question and then she was trying to lie to me then the voices said the answer and then i told my mum and then she was like yeah thats it does this ever happen to you where they say something then the next minute it happens,post-pandemic
ill drink enough alcohol that night maybe in july like the janitor of my neighborhood did i hope that it will be enough so like 05 1 l currently im drunk and im not afraid of death so i dont think i will be in few months im looking forward to the night when i die maybe it sounds weird but ill enjoy my life as good as i can in my last months im literally crying right now of happiness because i know im not alive in few months and it warms my heart soon ill be lying dead in a ditch or on a field in my village when i drank enough alcohol you cant imagine how im happy when i think about it im not so long alive only 17 years old but its enough for me i believe to be reborn in next life in hope ill be a boy in next life im having enough of being a girl and being sexually harassed we everywhere im sorry for my family friend and girlfriend but hopefully theyll understand it later i literally cant wait to die you cant believe it since my 6th birthday i dress like a boy and since im 8 i everyday wished to be a boy my family makes fun of people who are transgender but theyll regret it one day after i died and they saw my letter wow i hope the time will run faster i cant wait when ill drink myself to death when i feel when my body finally gives up and lose the ability to control my body i finally dont have to worry about the future because i only be with myself on the holidays and look up to the night sky smell the summer night air feeling the grass under me with my hands and die i think that will be it drinking alcohol and die since im 13 i think about different ways to die but that will be it vodka and no i dont want help it reassures me to think about people will read this hopefully it will be before my 18th birthday on the 25th 2006 of july if someone thinkswhy before your 18th birthday i dont know itd like ive never been an adult and i died in my childhood my younger self didnt have to worry about my future self and enjoy the remaining time its enough its like playing lotto stop when its doing good for you its not like on november 2021 when i tried to commit suicide for the first time its definitely more reassuring when youre drunk im serious when im sober i think about the risks and why to stay alive butb when im drunk i dont think about it,post-pandemic
im not going to brag about my own stability lets just say im successful bigger than getting the right medical cocktail bigger than going to the right therapist and bigger than my other privileges in life the largest beneficial thing ive done for myself is quitting drinking and using cocaine i went from weekly mood episodes and a steady hypomanic manic energy to experiencing episodes about once a year no coincidence they happen when i slip up in my sobriety if youre having trouble that you cant seem to escape no matter how hard youre working in other areas of your life please consider sobriety maybe its the missing piece of your recovery are you an addict reach out to sober groups aa na refuge recovery smart recovery all available for free near you and online refuge recovery in particular has been the best for me as it closely mirrors my buddhist faith if youre scared of going sober than it is probably best that you do and youll reap the benefits have questions about sobriety getting sober feel free to ask me anything,pre-pandemic
just wondering if medication can make you depressed im on risperidone 6mg and zoloft i just notice that since ive been on it i lay in bed a lot and feel nothing its helping with the voices and paranoia but i feel depressed and never know what to do with myself i dont enjoy anything anymore i pace around too i need advice on how to deal with the depression also ive gained 30 pounds on my meds and feel bad about it,post-pandemic
i often fantasize about dying i dont want to be here anymore its not even so much out of sadness anymore as it is just out of thinking realistically theres literally no point the only thing holding me back from doing it is i dont want to do that to my parents besides feeling like i just want to be dead i also deal with intense depression and thoughts that torment me i cant shake the feeling that something is just wrong with me and im never going to be happy or deserve to be happy theres this void in me and no matter what i do nothing fills it i tried talking to my ex about this while we were dating i told him about my self harm and how i just want to die about the self harm he told me to cut the right way if i wanted real results for the depression and suicidal thoughts he said he felt the same except he had a worse life so his depression was more justified he said i have a lot to be happy for it just made me want to kill myself even more but the thing is i dont think i want to die i just wish everything would stop and i could start over as someone else and honestly when i think about killing myself i fantasize about it not working but working just enough to hospitalize me its a sick fucking thought i know i think the main reason i want to attempt suicide is so the people around me will realize that im not just faking it or choosing to be depressed its not just for attention which is ironic to say considering i want to do it literally to get their attention but i just feel like in order for my pain to be taken seriously i need to show it to people somehow,pre-pandemic

ive been really struggling on top of dealing with my ptsd im pretty avoidant and thats left me with not much in the sense of safe spaces i lost my only one recently and i dont really know how to deal with it my home life contributes heavily to my symptoms i feel like i have no way out and no where to go the worst part is that i feel like its my fault it took me so many years to carve out that first stepping stone and i ruined it if anything i feel worse than when i had nowhere before now i know what safe can feel like and i have nothing to work with ive lost my only safe place all of my symptoms have gotten worse how does one recover,post-pandemic
im 28 male with a history of panic attacks gad and health anxiety up until about 7 months ago i used to workout every day pretty high intensity mixture of cardio and weight lifting i was in great shape great headspace etc then seemingly coinciding with some circumstantial life changes my anxiety came back maybe worse than its ever been before exercising suddenly became impossible as i was afraid of passing out having a heart attack etc etc there were times before i totally gave up that i could get through a workout but other times id get really dazed lightheaded dizzy i started lexapro around the same time after the anxiety symptoms and it didnt really help in some ways it reduced my quality of life ive been pretty constantly dizzy for 7 months have a hard time staying on my feet almost always feel offbalance and cant bring myself to exercise of course with my health anxiety i spend too much time researching what could be wrong with me and pots seems to be my latest fixation ive never passed out but pretty regularly feel like i could sometimes it seems like my heart rate spikes while standing but other times its not noticeable same with walking sometimes it even seems to alleviate symptoms but other times my heart races more showering too sometimes my heart rate spikes and i feel dizzy i wore a heart monitor for 3 days and everything was normal but i realize thats not necessarily relevant to diagnosing pots ive also had an mri and ct scan and full blood panel ive got an appointment with a cardiologist in a few weeks specifically to get screened for pots and do a stress test but i know that there is overlap between anxiety and pots symptoms and anxiety can even be a symptom of pots im just concerned that what i experience is more severe than just anxiety my quality of life has just deteriorated so significantly over the past 7 months that its hard to believe its just anxiety especially considering im medicated for what is supposed to help i recently switched to prozac i used to be so active and now i spend most of my day laying down has anyone had a similar experience i assume ill get a clear answer after i see the cardiologist,post-pandemic

wow what a freakin roller coaster life has been over the last 5 years i just wanted to write this for anyone considering quitting and this is coming from someone who about a month ago never would have thought that id be abstaining from just about every chemical out there ill try to keep this short but basically ive been abusing alcohol and various kinds of drugs since the age of 16 blackouts and doing dumb shit was all fair game over the last 14 years and despite all the troubles it caused me i never realized how damaging it was until i stopped it all the contrast ive witnessed in just a short time is what inspired me to write this post hopefully it helps someone my opiate problem started when i was 18 after a knee surgery it was true love at first buzz but thank god i never had full access to it until the age of 25 which is right when things got a little out of control i was introduced to oxys by a coworker which naturally blew percocets out of the water no more cold water extraction just pure oxy and the worst part im a functional addict so hitting rock bottom was more of an internal rock bottom and that surely came this went on off and on for about 5 years and thousands and thousands of dollars wasted on that dragon chasing ride i thought i was clever hiding it from everyone but the truth was everyone knew they always find out after long enough alcohol on the other hand was a constant never going more than a day or two without procuring a decent buzz foggy mornings became the norm and a baseline feeling like shit was the status quo about 4 months ago i lost my job which i wrote about a few months back it was a super bullshit situation which is when my usage of both alcohol and opiates sky rocketed more so than my normal usage of about 90150mgs a day i knew it was sky rocketing and that the problem was snow balling so october 20th 2019 i decided to stop the opiates once and for all no more one last times and ill stop tomorrow after i was already blasted its real easy to commit to stopping something when youre high but this time something internally felt different it felt for real this time holy hell im sure people who have used heroin might have more horrific stories but i went through the gnarliest withdrawals ive ever experienced hot cold back to hot sweating damn near shitting myself throwing up not eating back to the blankets turning on the fan taking off the blanket then freezing and putting them back on racing thoughts anxiety like youd never believe so many cravings and the worst the worst insomnia ive ever experienced although the worst of the physical symptoms subsided after about 34 days the insomnia went on for 12 days 12 hellish days that i will not forget my sleep still isnt perfect but at least now its manageable and worse was the booz i was chugging to make the symptoms go away and they certainly did for about 2 hours which was then followed by the worst boomerang effect ever anxiety worse insomnia worse depression way worse if youre quitting opiates do yourself a favor and stay away from booz seriously it makes it worse fast forward to november 4th 2019 and there i was hammered at 12pm passed out by 2pm and already hungover by 7pm i had enough i felt disgusted with myself and was sick of causing all this self induced pain so i quit and just for good measure i quit smoking too so here i am 24 days sober of opiates and 9 days sober from alcohol and cigarettes and if im honest really proud of it i have never in my adult life gone more than 4 days without drinking and all i can say is i have genuinely never felt better in my life everyone is different and everyones journey to sobriety is unique but all i can say is that for me it took a deep internal desire to stop this madness no one on this planet can convince you to stop but you has it been easy fuck no some days is moment to moment but the cravings come and they predictably go almost right on cue but deep within my soul i am committed to putting an end to this problem so despite me not being sober for that long i know myself to know that im done with this shit now im poised to face my demons with a sober mind that will undoubtedly take some callousing no more numbing unresolved problems things that have helped me tremendously meditation running every morning and cleaning up my diet personally i do things to the extreme so maybe you might like a more gradual approach but the point of this is i feel so much better that i cant even describe in words i am someone who struggled with constant depression and anxiety and crippling social anxiety and to my absolute amazement it is literally gone i never realized how badly the vicious cycle was affecting all parts of my life here i was thinking it helped my social life only to find it was killing it any time i think of going back i think back to the horrible horrible withdrawals and all the times i justified using only to regret it immediately after this has been key for me and when i have cravings instead of white knuckle fighting them i just acknowledge that theyre there and let them come and go like clouds in the sky easier said than done but every day gets just slightly easier so much for keeping this short but if youre trying to quit just know that although its going to undoubtedly suck the other side is so worth the pain and struggle it feels like life truly starts when you put down whatever numbing agent youre attached to and finally face reality with a clean mind but in my experience that day doesnt come without some serious internal conviction to stop if youre struggling you got this we got this cheers to all of you who can relate thank you all for the support and kind words truly means a lot to me and full disclosure i just ran into an exco worker who is absolutely gorgeous and i was so awkward something i used drugs and alcohol to mask so saying that was gone was a little premature but now something to work on with a sober mind update for everyone who sees this in the future im still sober off both alcohol and opiates 32 days off alcohol 42 days off opiates some days are harder than others but still going strong we got this,pre-pandemic
i cant bring myself to care about learning something or going to school or putting in work to achieve anything im currently employed but just find the whole thing meaningless im increasingly less and less able to pretend to have a sense of urgency at any job i dont want to spend so much of my life have to do this shit just to survive i just want to exist but the anxiety of imagining myself still in this position in my 40s and 50s eats me alive the shame of apply to jobs that would hire 19 yr olds the shame of doing something anyone could do and having a manager half my age and all that i just want to escape my mind holy shit,post-pandemic
am i even an addict ok stupid question but i took one oxy that was previously prescribed for a surgery that happened in may obviously that prescription was well past due and i abused the medication last night by taking one to ease my depression and anxiety i had a long convo with my family and i flushed the pills so i have no access to any oxy anymore but i am yearning for just one more im not an addict and never even dabbled in drugs before this just trying to find something to help me and ultimately that is therapy and medication proper medication i also dont plan on going to extremes to score more pills because i know how dangerous that can be ive never had issues with drugs prior like ever never even thought about doing drugs until the last week i slipped up and used that old prescription only one pill last night thats the situation in its entirety seems so small compared to what other addicts stories are which makes me wonder if im just overthinking only thing is i am sad i had to flush them and want more do i belong in na if im having urges to use oxy still even though i literally only abused it once advice would be appreciated,post-pandemic
so lately ive been thinking about the hard limits that having aspergers has placed on my functioning as a social animal my limits are of course different to yours and your limits are different to those of the next person on the spectrum but i think we can safely make a few general statements about the people reading this post youll never be the spontaneous charming hypersocial entertainer in your social circle but youre capable of giving an entertaining speech if you practice and youre not well suited to customerfacing roles but youre capable of performing work which is meaningful to you and valuable to your employer if your needs are accommodated and so on the idea is that were autistic but we also have the capacity to adapt to the world of neurotypicals as autistics we cant reach the highest levels of performance in the social realm but we can socially integrate with neurotypicals with enough skill to get that engineering job or that it role or whatever and let our true strengths shine i wonder though if starting and maintaining a romantic relationship should be considered a high level social task i wonder if most of us with highfunctioning autism just dont have the inherent social ability required for this sort of relationship ive been on speed dates and tried talking to women in public and it just feels like these activities arent meant for people with autism even normal people feel uncomfortable and have difficulty knowing what to say when theyre speaking to a potential date so what has your experience been with autism and the complicated rituals of dating,pre-pandemic

a fellow redditor posted a question about how to deal with fixating on symptoms and i decided to share my way perhaps it can be helpful to someone for me once i fixate on a symptom no form of distraction works reading playing games tv nothing the more i try to distract myself from it the more i notice it so i do these steps 1 accept that im experiencing a symptom yes i have a headache yes my heart palpitates and remind myself its just that a symptom and not a full blown deadly condition like my anxiety makes it to be 2 think of three different reasons why i may be experiencing this symptom that is not about dying aka i have a headache because ive stared at a screen for a few hours my heart is palpitating because i ate too much sugarim dehydrated etc 3 try to focus on a reason behind the symptom thats not about dying then try to do something about it if possible if i tell myself my palpitations are from lack of water i refill my water bottle if i tell myself im dizzy because of the lack of fresh air i go outside for a bit etc etc 4 in some cases when i am fixated to hell and back i confess itt to someone like hey im feeling uneasy today and im fixated on these palpitations i might speak stupid stuff for a bit im lucky i have close people who get me by now if youre all alone message us in this subreddit 5 i then spend a few hours going what if its actually a heart attack tho to my friend to which they say no its alright youre perfectly healthy its like fixating on yoir tongue in your mouth and suddenly it feels weird and restless and like something is wrong i say all the crazy shit that this symptom makes me think all of them even the silly ones like what of palpitations are actually my heart preparing to stop most of the time seeing someone else completely unbothered by my panicked thoughts make me relax because my friend would be actually worried if something was wrong them being calm shows me how crazy my anxiety makes it all to look like once ive said it all out loud its easier to stop rethinking the same things 6 next time i fixate my friend goes youre perfectly fine youve fixated on this before and you survived it i was there and you were fine after a while youll be fine again sometimes when i start overthinking and going omg why am i so dizzy my friend literally goes you were dizzy like this three weeks ago water helped you last time try that and it works you can also make a symptoms diary and note whenever you get a symptom and how long it lasted what helped it go away when it comes back etc once i knew my heart palpitations were mostly a symptom of too much sugar and not enough water i can somewhat help myself further on my main point is sometimes ignoring the symptom only makes it worse and actually facing it and your fear surrounding it is the only way to get through it and that comes from someone who was so fixated on their heart and breathing that actually caused incredible stomach ache because i was breathing wrong for months because i couldnt stop fixating on the damn breathing i had to retrain myself how to breathe properly and to finally realise that fixating on a symptom is a symptom of itself a symptom that my health anxiety is acting up hope this helps,pre-pandemic

one of my 20f guy friends was having a hard time today the dude is like 62 incredibly handsome works out studies engineering amazing teeth and energy but still struggles with self esteem bad anyways im always blown away when he says something about feeling ugly because i tell no jokes when i say this man is a solid 9510 by universal standards i was listing off all the attractive qualities about him in an attempt to make him feel better like that ever works with anybody and he finally breaks tells me he grew up really chubby and got thin in the beginning by severely restricting food even after losing the weight and seeing how people treated him differently he couldnt shake the vision of himself he formed as a kid fat ugly unloveable if anything glowing up made him more insecure i understood exactly what he meant i grew up with cystic acne chubby awkward i had no friends nobody took me seriously nobody saw me cue my junior year of high school an eating disorder platinum dyed hair and accutane and suddenly the world is full of generosity kindness respect and attention i saw the stereotypical mold of beauty and shoved myself into it no matter the cost on my physical and mental health and it proved 100 of my fears about people treating me badly because i was ugly my friend and i both agreed that glowing up didnt make us any more confident in fact it made us more paranoid and kinda justified our bad ed behavior we know what its like to be ugly and we know how much better life treats you when youre thin and pretty well do anything not to go back and were constantly terrified that we somehow transformed back into what we once thought we were without realizing it that were fat again we know it happened once and know that it could happen again both of us know that in reality our version of fat is probably closer to healthy and dont judge anyone else but ourselves based on these impossible standards can anyone else relate edit typo and thanks for the gold friend 3 edit 2 wow thank you all so much for sharing your stories and being so supportive my friend and i have been reading through all the comments as they come and we both agree thats its been so awesome and validating to see how many of us went through similar situations this community is amazing,pre-pandemic

this may or may not sound dumb but this makes sense to me marvel characters keep me going in a lot of the tough times they are very inspiring to me and i love them i am talking about the early marvel characters like iron man black panther thor and especially captain america iron man lost everything and rebuilt himself in a fucking cave black panther had his dad taken from him then his ideals get shaken he loses to an outsider in front of his entire kingdom in a duel and is thrown to his freaking death but he comes back stronger than before thor loses his mother then his father dies then his best friend and brother are killed in front of him but what does he do he doesnt lose hope until he meets his goal yes he loses hope in endgame but only after reaching his goal and then comes captain america a man out of place and out of time the scene where a literal god is unable to defeat thanos when iron man in his most advanced tech is incapacitated by thanos even when after getting the biggest power buff from mjolnir he loses to thanos his shield is shattered his arms is cut brutally losing against thanos in a 3v1 and then thanos army arrived what does he do he gets up straps himself up and stands tall and proud against the forces if captian america can stand upto thanos and his army i feel like i can battle loneliness as well if iron man can rebuild himself then i can too since i have more resources hope it makes sense to you all,post-pandemic

hey all so i am a highfunction autistic woman i hate that term but ill use it for simplicitys sake who has been a very creative individual since i was born moreorless ive always had a special interest in the arts namely drawing and writing since i was probably about 5 i am 33 now now people who dont know about this might find it a bit odd so bare with me since i was 13 or so one of my favorite forms of writing was collaborative writing in the form of roleplaying its a lot like dungeons and dragons where you make an original character and use that character to navigate a world with other people just instead of using dice roll mechanics on a board with character sheets its written freeform in a chat usually something like discord so between you and your roleplay partner you can craft out scenarios that have a sense of intrigue and sponteneity that you just dont get writing your own stories since another person is involved this interest has been a very strong one now for 20 years and though theres sometimes a year or so where im not actively roleplaying with another person id consider this a lifelong special interest i adore the aspect of character creation the sense of community around it and i have made a lot of friends through the hobby the issue is because it is a hobby that is collaborative and dependent on another person i find im having a lot of what feels like grief when i cant access this special interest because other writing partners are burnt out or too busy to write for a time and i cant find others it causes me to lose muse for the characters i write and as dramatic as it sounds it sometimes feels like im losing a child or some part of myself when i cant entertain these special interests anymore since this is a lifelong one i dont feel like my passion for it is going away anytime soon and none of my other interests including art video games reading etc hit as hard as this does as im late diagnosed with autism ive never had to navigate learning how to deal with grieving the loss of a special interest even if its only temporary how do you manage these intense feelings of what essentially like grief at losing a special interest,post-pandemic

looks determines nearly everything about how you feel about a person even for all of us lonely fuckers you might be chatting to someone and the chat is going great but then you both decide to exchange photos and the first person sends a photo and the other person thinks uhhhh this is not what i want at all and then they ghost immediately or the first person sends a photo and the other person likes their photo so then they send one but then the first person doesnt like the second persons photo and ghosts either scenario leaves someone feeling bad and thats life unfortunately some people here with this bullshit of i dont care what a person looks like i just want someone to talk to you are probably just really unattractive yourself and chronically online im not saying this to be rude to anyone but lets not pretend looks dont matter and we all know nearly all the guys here are only looking for girls and most of the girls here are just looking for a free therapist to trauma dump or they are looking for validation basically no one here is looking for actual friendship this sub is like water of the poisoned well most people here are toxic so keep your expectations in check,post-pandemic

i had my first psychosis in 2010 its been 14 years of struggles and the people who stigmatize me the most are my family i am frustrated and feel very alone prior to my first psychosis i was very accomplished in my career then my father died and its like i broke since that time i have struggled with people as it seems no one wants to hear about my experiences nor support me when i have issues with my thinking regardless of how much support i provide to them people are afraid negative harsh and dismissive to those they deem crazy and its not like i have erroneous thoughts all the time its rather on the occasion but enough that my recent bout of erroneous thinking has left me jobless i quit because of it and feeling completely unsupported i just want to meet other people who have had psychosis and recovered or are managing i would love to attend a support group but there is nothing anyone else feeling the desire to connect,post-pandemic
i dont know why but when i think about having sex or even cuddling and kissing i feel repulsed and disgusted by it more so when it comes to sex despite having or having had a high libido the mere thought of someone touching me is repulsive and frightening i keep thinking about it more because a lot of people talk about doing that regularly and it freaks me out how anyone could even put themselves in that situation i dont understand how people do that or what they get from it because to me that would be torture and painful and really frightening i want an emotional connection to someone thats extremely deep and trusting before i could even consider them worthy to touch me and even then the idea of getting to that point induces a lot of anxiety and repulsion in me i feel broken immensely because of it i wish i could be one of those people who just does it with whoever without care and feels good from it but i feel the complete opposite nothing but dread and taking away my autonomy and personhood,post-pandemic

i drive myself crazy when i dont know whats going on in a situation i have to talk my feelings out i have to figure things out i dont like to leave any room for assumptions because when i start assuming i cant stop i make lots of scenarios in my head and it drives me to be angry sad etc i am aware that i am like this and make it known to people but they dont listen when they dont listen i only get more upset this just goes back to a post i made before about how being alone might just be better i dont see why its so hard to just sit down and converse it saves a lot of time and confusion its only after i react to someone not doing a simple thing that people want to act like im crazy if i ask you to tell me why you feel a certain way im doing it for the both of us if you shut down give me a halfass answer etc i wont know what to do with myself or our situation and i shouldnt have to know i cannot read minds bpd or not everyone deserves something i hate this no one owes you anything attitude that everyone has i get that maybe its true but when you care about someone why would you not do everything you can to give them reassurance and comfort especially when you know theyre struggling mentally,pre-pandemic
this has been an issue for me since i was a child late 20s now it goes like this 1 im reserved not socializing with others andor i do something i deem as off 2 i promise myself next time ill be more social ill do this and that 3 it usually never happens im the same awkward person ive had a few reinventions but that was after a major shift graduating middle school high school college moving cities but even then my social anxiety and usual behavior trickles back in the cycle repeats 4 after i might ruminate for a bit and then fantasize about future encounters which i now know only make things worse because i put a lot of pressure on myself and set myself up for wanting nothing but perfection x200b every so often i get the urge to start over so bad i want to move neighborhoods because i feel like everyone knows me as my current personapersonality and not the friendly social person i want to be in reality they dont even know me but it seems like itd be odd if i act a different way than i do now ie from quiet to more friendly x200b x200b story from yesterday that prompted me thinking about this theres this guy i like in my neighborhood who ive ran into a few times each time i hate how the convo goesends which is stupid because he obviously doesnt think it was that bad or he wouldnt keep coming up to me to talk the issue is he seems to talk to other people longer than he chats with me so i take that as an issue with my conversation or that im coming off uninterested at this point i want to forget him and just pretend i never liked him because i feel our interactions have been less than ideal and hes made his mind up about me x200b im exhausted with myself,post-pandemic
i realized recently that i have a really bad grasp of compliments i was door dashing and delivered to a lady who complimented my piercings and clothes honestly i had no idea how to react i rarely get compliments but when i do im more dumbfounded than anything honestly so i told her thank you i love your bonnet but it felt really artificial i meant it but the way it sounded came off like i didnt mean it i felt rude and it was valentines day so i felt like an asshole and these sorts of situations have happened more and more often i realize now that im 20 and going to more events and interacting with more people that i get stuck with that dumbfounded look often i feel bad when people show me natural love and i cant reciprocate without sounding artificial i just want advice on how to get better at handling compliments what should i say whats the best way to sound natural i feel like ive overcome a lot of my social problems with autism but im not making progress here i usually overcome things like this with practice but im an intimidating size and a guy so i dont want to make women uncomfortable with random compliments i think im struggling with that idea the most because the lady i delivered to was very pretty but what can i say without sounding weird yknow,post-pandemic

ive been lonely and isolated for most of my life but occasionally i have friends and i am pretty social and its great for my mental health but then when my mental health worsens and people leave and im left alone feeling abandoned used and lied too i just always feel when i get back to this lonely place that im starting over again with no one and have less options to turn to i also feel like i want to try less to reach out and grow cause how i dont have the trust to give,pre-pandemic
that to me while maybe not illintentioned is quite quite wrong,pre-pandemic
i just dont want anything to do with them i feel embarrassed when i see them i guess part of it is cause ive changed since then and others have seen my manic episodes i literally hate going back to old work places and i usually refuse even when i need to its not like i made any lasting friendships there and i just feel awkward about doing it i guess the outcome is theyll either talk to me and see what ive been up to which i cant be bothered with or theyll just straight up ignore me because we werent close and that could potentially get to me i guess for old friends i think its more to do with social media activity when manic im scared to use facebook if i was to update my facebook i could only put up a picture or something incase my sense of humour went over peoples ahead or they start questioning why im updating my status and reacting as they do when im manic i downloaded twitter but then realised to actually enjoy it you should have some people following you back without having friends you might aswell just enjoy reddit which im doing i am down to no friends because i sort of wanted that i have no burning desire to make new friends i mean it would be cool to say i have some but i dont actually see the point i have a gf anyway so guess thats enough,pre-pandemic

sorry if this gets a bit long i met my friend m35 10 years ago when i moved alone across the country we were bartenders our friendship back then was very blackout drinking and rinse and repeat i ended up getting sober and worked on myself in 2018 and lost a lot of my friends from the industry except him he would show up and take me out to places to keep me from going mental with how isolated i felt in 2019 i met my now fiance we hit it off and got engaged soon to be married june this year in hawaii i asked him to be my best man i ended up getting an incredible paying union job with a pension in 2020 and put my neck out for him to get him in i wanted to pay it forward and give him an opportunity for a better life than bartending during the first year he worked his dad who was older 75 suddenly passed and his year got hard i always knew he was kind of a crappy worker and had an addiction to drinking and playing games causing him to get complacent at work honestly he sucked at the job long story short he ended up having several no shows at work in 20212022 from sleeping in and i knew it was a result from gaming and drinking all hours of the night before his shift he has a very defensive reaction and would blame it on work being out to get him or the shift work he got suspended and put on a probation for 16 months the short term result was his attendance got better for 10 months but he could care less about doing the job right i ended up several months ago paying for his flights along with my fiance and her maid of honor for our micro close family wedding 12 guests he owed me for portions of the hotel which i was fine with him paying whenever well this month he called in 6 shifts in a row sick and then got really drunk during the super bowl and stayed out talking with some girl at the bar till 3am he had to work 7am monday safe to say he no showed after 3 hours of my boss calling he came in and reeked of booze we drive forklifts so its quite problematic im all but positive he just fucked the job lost out on a pension 3 day work week and a job that pays 5x what you make bartending i feel off and unsure how to approach it hes broke because hes bad with money he lives paycheque to paycheque and has nothing to his name ive accepted hes not coming to the wedding im not even sure how to approach him because im just flat disappointed he ruined a massive opportunity for a future he will get evicted because he chose to rent a place way over his budget and will have no place or family to fall back on i know if i come down on him it will do no good i also know he thinks he doesnt have a problem how should i handle this my fiance feels for me and honestly im a bit angry and bitter just because he could of had everything in life and retirement and will end of falling back to the restaurant industry,post-pandemic

im naturally a quiet polite person in professional settings its just how i can get by when im in the workplace i turn extra quietpolite because its a professional environment however the reactions i get from people when i talk make me think i come across as really weird or fake because im not being authentic my responses are just on the polite or quiet side quite agreeable i just dont want to offend anyone and i dont have the energy to try and be my true self because i get so caught up in cringing at what i do say i work with people who are loud full of banter smart but definitely more on the loud side and unafraid to say whats on their mind ive been the target of bullying from people in better roles than me when i first started at my job and that severely knocked my confidence down i felt isolated and i still do i was outcasted by them and am still outcasted i got a promotion recently but i feel it was out of pity because ive been there for two years and my predecessor was loved by everyone because of their outgoing bubbly and banter nature everything im not they all miss this person and being her quiet replacement makes me feel awful its really obvious the difference in how much they liked this person and not me i get stomach knots thinking about going to work even wfh is hard because of the meetings i say cringe things or reactions make me feel like i do and dont let myself live them down i wonder if i will always feel like this no matter what workplace i go to i hate feeling sorry for myself but i feel so stuck i dont know if this is social anxiety or if its just common nerves most people get being in an environment they dont feel comfortable in despite being there for years new people come and go and i still arent able to form a real connection with them and it makes me think im the problem i try my best to be nice friendly and laugh at others jokes and ask them questions about themselves but yeah just feeling extremely isolated and like a complete joke and fraudster,post-pandemic
the other day i fell down the stairs in my house i was sick with the flu on my period and hours into a fast i went upstairs and on my way back down to the basement everything went black for a brief second and i fell down the stairs nothing serious happened as i manage to avoid hitting my head or landing on my tailbone it did hurt tho dealt with some back pain for the following days and had some bruises here and there what was really messed up was that i realized what i was doing to my body and i got annoyed with how it was reacting i literally got angry that my body was so weak that i could barely walk and fell down the fkn stairs i know it sounds stupid as its pretty obvious i would be weak and i know i was very lucky that i didnt get more hurt i was experiencing a lot of different symptoms that i brushed off as being caused by the flu or my period but i knew deep down i was experiencing fatigue etc to that extend because i wasnt providing my body with the fuel it needed to recover from the flu instead it was shutting down and that annoyed me i came to the realization i had to eat something as was tired of being too weak to exercise but i was also very upset that i had to break my fast and eat now a week later ive recovered from the flu and i keep thinking about the incident i realize how fkn messed up my thinking was and i honestly cant believe im capable of abandoning my humanity like that now i wish i had just eaten because of how miserable i felt and honesty it wasnt worth starving for not that starving is ever worth it it resulted in me taking a step back to think things over and now im attempting to take a different approach to this its difficult and im far from ready to enter recovery but it keeps replaying in my head and i know i need to do something different i dont know what the point of this post is but i felt like i needed to share this with someone anyone thank you,post-pandemic
so i recently started working in a school as an it technician as it is something i am serious and passionate about getting into plus i am studying at university in it too i had my first day at the school last week and it went really well and i enjoyed it but i sometimes found that walking into classrooms randomly with a room of 2030 kids all staring at you is really daunting i believe this is normal as i have never worked in a education environment before has anyone else experienced this before or know any good strategies to tackle not feeling anxious about going into full classrooms,post-pandemic
my life has been really fucking shitty for the past 9 months or so i had really bad anxiety attacks then ive had anxiety my entire life but these were the worst attacks ive ever had and that ended up forming into depression after fearing i would always be horribly anxious everyday combine that with constantly going on and off with nicotine withdrawal and thats where i was at while i still deal with depression and anxiety i really thought i had been steadily improving this month felt like the best month for me in a long long time and i still think thats true ive been having problems with my throat that makes talking hard in the past year and i finally went to an ent specialist for it and started treatment my depression felt like it was dying down and my health anxiety was put to ease after the ent appointment confirmed i didnt have cancer or anything and then today happened i didnt even know i had a doctors appointment today checkup i got there and like usual everything seemed alright with me except for my heart rate and blood pressure im 20 years old and have an anxiety attack practically every time im at the doctors office my pulse was 139 while my bp was 14199 i now have to monitor my blood pressure for the next month or so get blood work done and go back in a month i was also up to 169 pounds today was always around 150 during high school im just so fucking tired of this i just turned 20 ive been an athlete all of my life except for the past year dealing with these issues and i was starting to get back into daily exercise still am im a smart kid have money in my bank account despite not working full time student i feel like ive been doing things the best i can and yet i always end up back here im just so tired you know whats even worse im not stupid and im not heartless i know damn well people have it worse than me and that makes me feel guilty complaining like this a kid i knew in high school developed leukemia and lived through hell for two years before having to ask his own mother to let him go and here i am complaining about my problems any encouraging words would be much appreciated im just so exhausted im 20 years old and i treated my body well for the first 18 years of my life and while i havent treated it great in the past 2 most people i know my age treat theirs even worse and are fine now im sitting here with mental health problems and possible high blood pressure at 20 it just feels so fucking unfair,pre-pandemic
my 29m girlfriend 28f of around 1 year is an alcoholic and my life is turning into a living hell when we started dating i have noticed that she might have some problems with drinking but we knew each other since we were teens and i knew that she is a good and bright person plus all the drinking that she did didnt seem destructive in any way i used to enjoy my fair share of friday drinks with friends but it never really lasted more than one day and i had never have had problems stopping so i didnt think of it as much of a problem a couple months into a relationship i started to have talks with her because the situation was getting out of control eventually she admitted to the fact that shes an alcoholic that she was in the minnesota program last year but it didnt really help she expressed the desire to quit but she didnt know how so i got onto the issue and started to help her overcome it she started going on the aa meetings started going to psychiatrist for while it seemed that situation is improving but now its worse than ever in retrospective i think maybe i shouldve just walked out on it right then but here i am basically what our lives are like right now is one month of sobriety and then just a week of complete alcohol induced chaos during her periods of sobriety she doesnt display any of the bad traits she does when shes drinking when she starts drinking i dont know where she goes i dont know where she gets drunk whom shes hanging out with at this point she has lost her phone her documents her job and i all have a period when everything was going uphill when she is around however she is throwing tantrums trying to break stuff just being a huge pain in the ass overall barely standing on her feet i cant even really throw her out of my place because she just returns a couple hours after being more drunk and reeks havoc on my neighbours which has led me to a few potential problems in the past all of this causes great amount of stress for me and affects my health my job performance and my life overall after her latest relapse i couldnt really talk to her i was trying to say that im done with this that i dont need this in my life but she was still buzzed not completely sober and started to trying to guilt trip me saying stuff like she wont survive without me or she doesnt want to survive without me thats why i decided to hold off the conversation and drive her down to the seven day rehab and now im just thinking what should i do with this situation im tired of playing detective trying to figure out where has she gone why shes returning in different clothes than she went out in and just so you know its not a kind of party drinking in the clubs or bars for that matter its like on going outside without any money and just finding a drink and in anyway possible sometimes hanging out with hobos or something she is a young and beautiful girl so im constantly thinking of what could be happening there but never found any proof of her wrongdoings in terms of infidelity she doesnt display any signs of promiscuity when shes in her sobriety as well so my question is have you encountered any similar situations or have any advice on what should i do am i enabling her behaviour by staying by her and trying to help her out of it should i just walk out do you think she is really trying to get better and not just manipulating me to stay beside a comfortable situation for her i mean i realise looking at this nobody wants to live like that but im not sure if im helping her or enabling her thank you for reading,post-pandemic

so im wondering how other people with social anxiety came to have a partner did you need to significantly overcome your struggles first or did you manage to find someone despite still struggling with those issues if so how what kind of situation enabled it to happen im a girl in her early 20s with social anxiety inexperienced i havent put effort into dating since i want to improve myself first through more therapy fitness and im busy with university but i cant see myself ever making the first move even after improving myself i could put myself out there in the future avoid social scenes less but i think id still be unapproachable to men because of how shyawkward i am so im especially curious about how other girls with sa got into a relationship,post-pandemic
like a lot of us i have a lot of difficulty in the hygiene department theres a very specific reason i dont feel safe in my shower but thats another story if youre not familiar rshowerorange is simple eat an orange in the shower but you have to eat it like an apple no wedges yes peel it first ive been intrigued for a while but i tried it on a whim because it was time it helped me because i have problems getting in the temperature chance the liquid its a lot of stimulus but the orange became my only concern and it helped to have a fun distraction while my body was acclimating oranges are a strong aromatic too giving the whole thing a spa type smell even with my disabled sniffer it was actually pretty great,pre-pandemic

hey guys just wanted to share something that my therapist told me that had helped me reel in my health anxiety she described the human body as extremely noisy lots of noises sensations pains twitches etc like all anxiety disorders the brain is hypersensitive and basically catastrophically misinterprets these noises that most people just ignore or dont notice in the first place i found it helpful to try and remember in the context of someone with health anxiety that my background noise is just louder than most and to recognize various symptoms i feel as just that figured id share if that thought can help anyone reframe how they perceive whats going on in their bodies,pre-pandemic

hello so i have always since i can remember had a very intense reaction if i sawexperienced someone really drunk as a kid i would start shaking all over and was scared shitless my single mother didnt drink much a glass of wine every few months but even in those instances i would cry if i saw her with that glass my father whom i visited every couple of weeks drank a lot sometimes he had a rowdy bar and although i dont remember if something bad happened to me there i know he sometimes took me there when i was very very little and would work while i was sitting somewhere my grandfather was an alcoholic i remember him being difficult and a general air of fear of everyone in the evening where he would drink when i would visit my grandparents now when i see someone really drunk i get a physical response that is not at all proportional to whats happening ill see a girl whos completely blacked out drunk and my heart rate goes absolutely crazy i start shaking i begin crying hysterically and i have these overwhelming emotions of fear hatred disgust and aggression these feelings will be so intense that i dont feel in control of myself anymore if my partner comes home very drunk the same thing happens i lock my door when i know hes out with friends and every little sound will send my heart rate up because he might be coming home and i dont know what state he is in if he comes and is drunk i will have the same physical reactions and also an urge to hurt him emotionally while being deathly afraid of him at the same time it doesnt make any sense at all when i get out of the situation these feelings will subside a bit but come up to a lesser extent again and again until they get better my mind keeps showing me a highlight reel of drunk people and situations like it my therapist is of the opinion that trauma can only be caused by being in a situation where you really fear for your life not by being in simply bad situations also theres no pictures in my mind from when i was a kid or something that acoompany these intense emotions i dont feel like i can name what situations exactly im flashing back to its like im only flashing back emotionally can anyone relate to this it is debilitating sometimes thank you,post-pandemic
the socalled psychotically depressed person who tries to kill herself doesnt do so out of quote hopelessness or any abstract conviction that lifes assets and debits do not square and surely not because death seems suddenly appealing the person in whom its invisible agony reaches a certain unendurable level will kill herself the same way a trapped person will eventually jump from the window of a burning highrise make no mistake about people who leap from burning windows their terror of falling from a great height is still just as great as it would be for you or me standing speculatively at the same window just checking out the view ie the fear of falling remains a constant the variable here is the other terror the fires flames when the flames get close enough falling to death becomes the slightly less terrible of two terrors its not desiring the fall its terror of the flames and yet nobody down on the sidewalk looking up and yelling dont and hang on can understand the jump not really youd have to have personally been trapped and felt flames to really understand a terror way beyond falling this quote is from infinite jest by david foster wallace im honestly starting to feel the flames and the jump is looking far too comforting,pre-pandemic

heed warnings please i mention thoughts of suicide and self harm in this post also i think i have some pretty toxic thoughts here not actions but im worried that ill slip up and actually do something stupid hi everyone im kinda sitting here shaking with rage over a situation thats stupid and unimportant and i wanted to ask if anyone has ways they try and simmer down that isnt just talk to someone as that isnt an option now and often never is i would just like some coping mechanisms or outlets i dont get angry very often genuinely i do get upsetoffended sure but not angry so when i do reach a point where i get angry its likeall consuming my chest hurts its hard to breathe my mouth gets all dry and i just shake its awful and exhausting and i fucking hate it i have no thoughts of physically harming others maybe fantasies of telling them off but never anything violent but i do get thoughts of physically harming myself or even sometimes i get suicidal thoughts over it i have a history of self harm currently about 10 months without relapse woo and have attempted to take my life before i mention this just because when you have a history of doing things it makes those thoughts all the more scary i dont know if its a call for attention or a weird sort of punishment like a you made me so mad i hurt myself feel bad kind of thing or a youcantbemadatahurtgirl type of thing though in this situation the person im angry at isnt even angry at me just someone im close to or something else when i reach this level of rage i just want to hurt myself and want them to know it i dont usually i have maybe once twice in the past when i was a teenager like 10ish years ago but i still dont like how allconsuming the thoughts are i will also note that i do not and have not vocalized these thoughts to anyone especially the people i get angry at i just have themconsider them typing this has helped a bit so maybe thats part of the answer but still i would like to know more of what some of you guys do to deal with intense anger i dont need a productive outlet but i would like one that isnt destructive either im diagnosed bipolar 2 im supposed to be on medsin therapy but ive been without either for about 4 12 months now as i dont have insurance or the money for it,post-pandemic

hi okay so ive always been pretty good at comforting people but i realized how that maybe that i havent been giving them what they need let me set an example friend i had a shit day and i miss you me aw i miss you too maybe you can cook your favorite food and wear my hoodie while watching your favorite show i of course also ask why their day has been shitty but i always provide solutions i hope will work but i also realized that maybe they arent looking for solutions but for comfort so basically what im asking is how do i comfort people and not just provide solutions this is really stressing me out and i really want to know how to be a better boyfriend family member and friend,post-pandemic
growing up as far as i can recall my parents never made me drink water and they always gave me milk or juice when i was thirsty ive always been a very picky eater and i think my parents were just happy that i managed to stay hydrated nowadays i get most of my fluids through those lightly flavored water bottles with no sugar its not that i just dislike water the issue is that for whatever reason my body is just repulsed by it what i mean is that even if im severely dehydrated i can only take the tiniest most insignificant sips if any at all otherwise ill literally throw up or dryheave its about as easy for me to drink water as it is for me to drink straight alcohol which i also hate attempting a shot would make me vomit i just hear a lot about people not drinking enough water or disliking the taste and i have met a couple people that also refuse to drink water but do any of you all have a similar relationship with water,post-pandemic
ive been trying to google and read up on this but thought id ask real people my boyfriend has been a highfunctioning alcoholic since long before i met him i didnt realize this was the case until i started hanging around his place more but decided to address it later on because i was quite infatuated with him at that point i know i know weve only been together a little over a year but we live together now onto the issue weve been facing some financial issues so he hasnt been able to buy alcohol for the past couple of days a few hours ago i woke up to find him not in bed but rather on the couch he does that when hes not feeling well so he can be closer to the bathroom i just threw a blanket on him and went back to bed about a hour later i was half asleep when i heard a gushing water sound so i ran out to find him throwing up in the kitchen sink i went to rub his back and felt how shaky and sweaty he was after he was done i helped him back to the couch kept him on his side and put a little trash bin by him he assured me that he was feeling better and to go back to bed i did but only because our apartment is tiny and i can hear if he tries to get up or if hes having trouble of some sort a little while later i heard a little ruckus and found him clutching the kitchen sink while shaking uncontrollably i helped him get to the bathroom so he could do his business cleaned him up and back to the couch he also keeps saying nonsense words and phrases randomly grab the snuggle logs lock em up herdaroy biggle bomb or something like that it doesnt make sense and now were here i tried to get him to go to the hospital but he refuses because he said hes been through this before and that hell be fine not that we could really afford a big hospital bill anyway as neither of us have health insurance i thought about nudging him to smoke some weed we live in a state where its legal in hopes that itd help with the shakes and nausea those crazy tremors from earlier seem to have subsided for now but he still is a bit shaky do symptoms come in waves he does seem alright at the moment anyway any advice on the matter would be appreciated im considering not going to work today just so i can look after him edit he ended up having a seizure took him to the er hes stable right now he was drinking about a bottle of brandy per day he drank the last of it the day before yesterday so he was drinking beer throughout the day yesterday he seemed a little off and irritable when i got home from work yesterday but seemed otherwise okay up until early this morning but thanks for everyones input id rather have a hospital bill over any other terrible outcome,post-pandemic

i was addicted to iv opiates and meth from age 2024 i am now 26 and 2 years sober at the end of my addiction i was in a hospital for 3 months with endocarditis not sure if i would die not sure i cared today i am back in college with a 39 gpa i wake up every day and i feel happy its such a gift i think its important to share stories of success to keep people going it took a long time sober to feel normal again but i really do i never thought i would get better but i was wrong dont give up on yourself dont die on the people that love you keep trying to get sober because whats waiting on the other side is better than anything you could imagine while down in the depths of addiction and depression always here to support anyone fighting for their life,pre-pandemic
recently i just started drinking coffee i originally only started because of school and because i have a really early first block but after i started i felt like i was a lot more hyper and for some reason this also made it quite a bit easier to talk to people without feeling so much anxiety and overthinking it i was trying to look on here to see if anyone else was the same way but it seems like its the opposite is it just me or does anyone else get the same reaction,post-pandemic
there is no other way anymore i have lied and been an idiot and a failure for my entire life there is no turning back anymore and nothing can fix this there really is no fixing this im 19 years old fucked up my entire life i have mutilated my body and ruined my life by letting my mental health detiorate till i ented up being trapped in my lies its been years i have been depressed my entire life on top of that i have dysphoria and purge often im going to clean my room and get rid of my stuff once its dark im going for a walk and will overdose on pills and vodka and stil my wrist or maybe ill go and get a rope either way today is the day i dont know why im posting this ive been in pain for years i feel so empty and wrong and evil and have felt like that my entire life i need someone to know so im posting it here edit thank all of you for reaching out i wish the best for you all ive cleaned my room left a note and visited a friend im going to my hopelly final destination now thanks and good luck in life,pre-pandemic
it really plants a deep seed of anger and irritation in my heart when i hear those words i also hate being told that i have to be strong even though i know its relatively decent advice no shit i have to be strong otherwise i wouldnt even be here right now someone said to me that they went through a comparable minor incident breakup of a 2 year relationship and got through it by praying to god saying it liberated him and made him feel so content with life and while yes he is valid to feel upset about it i dont think its appropriate to bring that up to compare to my bus crash and my mental recovery with it they and their family also went on to tell me that my medication was all gateway bullshit that i need to get off of and being the passive dipshit i am i agreed with them and went along with all of it not to mention when i told them i have ptsd they went on to ask about my symptoms and even asked oh what are your visions what are your nightmares what do you see at night and a ton of followup questions that forced me to go into detail that i didnt want to again im passive as hell so its not easy to say no to anyone but i just wish people were more considerate and understanding its not like im asking them to never talk about vehicle accidents or to never make any quick movements so why is it so hard to be decent and accommodate my basic needs im sure people who dont have ptsd at least know not to fucking ask about their flashbacks in detail,pre-pandemic
im struggling a lot recently and have been choosing weed and smoking tabaco over my own health its never been this bad and i dont know what to do i wish id respected my body and self more,post-pandemic
im not going to comment on posts trying to justify other peoples decisions im perfectly happy to give support to others and offer up my own experiences etc but when people are consistently making wrong decisions something needs reevaluating we need to take responsibility and not play the victim wed feel so much more empowerment and confidence if we did this,pre-pandemic
i was addicted to heroin and meth for over 10 years it caused me to be a terrible person to the people that loved me most and make awful decisions to lie cheat steal and do unspeakable things just for a quick high i ended becoming homeless and unemployed married to another addict who was both physically and mentally abusive it took me 2 years to get away from him he would stalk me whenever i tried to leave until i was put into a domestic violence shelter over the ten years of my addiction id tried to get clean at least 9 times always with the same program and counselor but this time finally free from my husband and having hit lower than rock bottom this time it finally stuck i slowly began to earn back the trust of my loved ones and was able to move back in with my parents believe me thats huge and im finally getting back on my feet and ive literally never been happier well thats my story i know it was long so thank you so much for taking the time to read it mandy,pre-pandemic
i was on suboxone for about 10 years and i constantly abusedrelapsed onto heroin it did not work for me i no longer consider myself an addict and have no cravings i know exactly where that road leads and it is in a place where you are sick as hell 75 of the time and your life sucks i would have never made it through a taper it was hell for the better part of a year but it was worth it i am 8 years off klonopin too that was harder in many respects,pre-pandemic
because you never asked me to come with you instead you made plans behind my back had fun while i had to be dragged around and when i asked you why you didnt invite me you told lies so i can feel better because everytime i talk with people they never care or even have some decency to look like they care because everytime i tried to be friendly and interesting i always am weird unfunny and cringe you always said sorry and ill be better next time but we both know it wont ever come true,post-pandemic
my boyfriend has deployed twice i was raped by my partner at the time not my current boyfriend kept the baby and tried to stay until the police came one too many times and threatened to call cps if i didnt remove my child from his house asap sd wasnt involved and eventually died his family has used the court system to harass me for years since anyway i was upset and talking to my boyfriend about it and he said i chose this i didnt choose to be raped i chose to keep my child and do what i thought was the right thing i didnt choose the life sentence of harassment and abuse from my ex and his family ever since my boyfriend constantly tells me to suck it up because at least ive never been to war this makes me feel like he is a true sociopath and i should block his number and never look back someone please tell me im not crazy for thinking that my ptsd is just as significant as his,pre-pandemic
i havent taken my stimulants in two days have been eating like shit i want nothing more than to be alone and binge to my stomachs desire but my bf and sister are here i got pissed on my anniversary that my bf took one of our sugared nut cones away from my reach bc i had already eaten one and was gonna eat the other completely like what the fuck is wrong with me i was doing so well with my fasts n keto to drop this literal excessive weight and i think i gained again bc i certainly didnt shed anything i thought about offin myself earlier bc when my adhd isnt treated all i think about is my next hit of carbs like im so fucking tired of being obese,post-pandemic
its times like this that it becomes very clear why this is a disability ive become mute today after a very eventful but overstimulating sequence of days irritation has been through the roof and today it hit me like a bus this time and every other time the sudden realization that a meltdown may be soon imminent seems all too surprisingunsurprisingly tomorrow marks day four of my unavoidable gauntlet of productivity there are many things planned that i must attend tomorrow but i feel the impending meltdown drawing ever closer i very much struggled today and know a meltdown will likely be unavoidable but would like to hear how everyone copes when they feel a shutdownmeltdown is imminent im very overwhelmed and underslept this has been tough to grapple with a seemingly normal productive day for a normal person drains me immensely and consecutive productive days deemed by normalcy has me over the edge this isnt something i can avoid but rather need to learn to cope how does everyone do it i threw my headphones on cleaned took an hour shower and lie in bed writing this reddit post,post-pandemic

hi everyone i understand if anyone here has ever experienced this and may be affected by it but i felt the need to ask while i do have ocd and it has manifested in a variety of different ways i genuinely question whether this is one of them or not do i seem like a stalker this has really been affecting me and i dont know if i deserve to die or not and i feel like a coward for not having the strength to do anything i 22m have never really had friends in the genuine sense i was homeschooled then entered college at a young age and i feel like ive always lacked a lot in terms of social and emotional development i always got jealous from afar when i saw how people were good friends with each other and i wished i could have those kinds of friendships too i found myself often imagining being friends with a lot of the people i went to class with because it made me forget how lonely i felt i feel like i currently do have someone who id consider a friend even a close friend but im very conscious that someone i see as a close friend may not see me the same way she is the only person who actively texts me and i love having her in my life she has opened up to me about a lot of things that have affected her and i feel honored that she values me so much that she has told me these things and i hope to be friends with her for a long time if possible i have found myself getting jealous of other people shes friends with in class but ive caught myself on that jealousy and called myself out for it i know its unhealthy but i cant help feeling that jealousy theres a worry in the back of my mind that shes going to make friends with people who she likes better and theres gonna be no place in her life for me anymore and it hurts knowing that i just truly want to be a person who is a positive force in someone elses life i feel like my own insecurity is heavily tied in there the fact that i am not good enough in my own eyes and im aware of that too i wish i could approach my feelings in a more healthy manner to show how much i care about her ive made her little crafts and stuff and she seems to have genuinely appreciated all of them this jealousy is something that has carried over to all my friendships i know its common in stalking but i am very often jealous of someones other friends but i do not say this to their face because i do not want to be controlling i truly want people to have other friends but i also dont want to be abandoned if i am abandoned itll feel like a true punch in the gut because ill be truly alone and being alone feels horrible i just wish i could be a better friend but it just feels like im incapable of doing any good for anyone it seems like i can only bring bad things to others lives and im genuinely sick of being like this at this point i dont know if its even worth it continuing on knowing that i might not be able to change the same thing is true people ive had crushes on over the years in the past ive been super excited to be around them tried to talk to them more to get to know them as people but ive been scared to admit feelings for any of them because im worried about how they would take it knowing how i feel i dont want them to get any trauma from knowing i like them i dont know why i worry about that but i do and i also dont want to become a social outcast because they tell everyone we know so historically ive approached it in an unhealthy and intrusive manner talking to online friends about it thats where i get very open about it the fact i found them cute that i wanted to date them how happy i felt around them asking for advice with what to do and so on never have i ever talked in a nsfw manner about them because thats not who i am but i recognize that it still may be breaching some version of boundaries to talk about them online to people they dont know especially as often as i did talk about them but never did i ever have intentions of doing anything bad to them i am genuinely not that way as a person i would never harass them send them gross messages try to do anything in person follow them around threaten them anything like that i just have never felt like i have a genuine chance with any of them but it was nice to think about at times and i was always too scared to tell them how i felt in case it would gross them out or hurt them i cant approach my feelings in a healthy manner or do right by anyone and knowing how others would feel knowing that i out of all guys like them i just feel horrible and idk what to do anymore as a side note whenever someone in the past has shown interest in me yes its happened like a halfdozen times or so i have never known how to process it and i usually dodge flirting and stuff bc part of me still has my immature side where the thought that anyone would be attracted to me is kinda overwhelming i still dont know how to react when someone says they actually like me all this being said am i a truly bad person i dont even know anymore ive been questioning all of my decisions lately i dont know if i deserve a chance to better myself and move on my gut is telling me i dont my gut is telling me that im one of those people that genuinely deserves to die i would like to become a much more healthy and positive friend and maybe partner someday as well i would like to approach my feelings both platonic and romantic in a more healthy manner and feel secure enough in myself that i do not feel ashamed to become friends or more with someone and i want to improve so that i truly deserve having that one friend in my life because i strongly value her opinion of me but i dont know if i can or if im worthy of any of that in summary im confused and scared if i am a bad person i know that i might not deserve to live and i genuinely do not know whether i can do enough good for someone else to deserve to live or if i have done that kind of good i feel like such a coward for not ending myself i think about it all the time now if im never going to add any genuine good to others lives i dont know what to do anymore it seems like the only thing im capable of is doing things for selfish reasons i dont want to be that way anymore but its so hard to change my thinking i want to change and become a good person but i just dont know anymore my brain wont stop this its like its on overdrive i just want it to end,post-pandemic

25 years ago i had a near death experience that landed me in a medically induced coma for 9 days i thought 10 years had gone by when i woke up and i lost 30 pounds of muscle that experiences also unlocked a lot of repressed memories for me i was sleeping at most 4 hours a night barely eating and i couldnt stand the company of others i was a horrible wreck and barely able to function 15 years after that experience i was able to start therapy i also went back to physical therapy and both of these therapists kept recommending a book to me about the impact ptsd has on us it was written by a psychologist who has been treating trauma since the early 1970s starting with vietnam war veterans moving on to specializing in treating people who have been physically or sexually abused as children it took me a long time to finally get this book i was convinced the connection i had with my body was permanently altered because of this overwhelming experience i could barely feel my left side my throat was totally numb from the tube they had down my throat even 2 years later the sheets of my bed made my skin crawl reminding me of struggling weakly to move around in the hospital bed i was too traumatized to believe relief was possible then i started reading this book maybe this wont be everyone but reading this book makes me think that what is happening to me is actually understandable its manageable its treatable and its not permanent i can feel more now things are getting better its easier for me to deescalate the tension and stress i feel on a daily basis,pre-pandemic
my first language isnt english so im very sorry if anything is misspelled well i 18f have a friend 20f that i met about a year ago who ill call e at the time e and i met i was very vulnerable as i had just had a fight with an old friend whom i will call o o and i met more than ten years ago and we started being best friends more than five years ago neither o nor e is autistic but at least up until before the fight i always felt that o understood me pretty well the reason for our separation was in short because i did not feel appreciated in the group of friends i had and although i am used to being the butt of the joke it hurt me a lot to see o actively participating in them especially after what we went through together and how united we became as a result of the pandemic anyway the fact is that i expressed my disagreement and as expected i did not have very positive responses the whole thing made me a bit depressed and for that i am very grateful to e because she was the only one who was there for me at that moment from then on i guess e became my new best friend although if im being honest i never really felt like we really were not because i didnt like her but because i felt like we still had a lot to get to know each other e is quite affectionate unlike me who has a hard time showing affection but i understood that was her love language and made the greatest effort to reciprocate her in the same way also e was lets say a little unstable she had breakdowns at times which led her to ghost me for weeks or even months i never took those episodes personally and when they happened i simply asked her how she felt and assured her that she could take all the time she needed that i was there for her something however that i cannot change is my dislike of going outside i dont usually accept plans from my closest friends with whom i feel pretty comfortable or even from my family because they overwhelm me a lot and i prefer to save myself the stress therefore evidently i did not accept any plans from e either but not before telling her that this was probably related to my autism also i feel the need to mention that making plans with e was very difficult since we live in completely different parts of town have different budgets different schedules and of course because of my resistance to go out however everything was fine until o sent me a text after months without hearing from her she wanted to see me honestly i think i have a very strong attachment to o i would do anything for her even after what happened furthermore i feel comfortable in her presence because i have known her all my life and she was the first person to whom i told that i had autism of course i accepted her plan and since e was my best friend i told her about it she automatically became colder with me even a little mean and then stopped responding completely for a couple of weeks that was until i received a notification from her saying that it had hurt her deeply that i had accepted os invitation since she is someone who hurt me a lot and not hers she also mentioned that she hates texting and that it bothered her that she did that for me but i couldnt make time to go out with her from my point of view its not the same my problem with going out runs deeper especially considering al the complications with her specifically i dont yet feel entirely comfortable we live in different parts of the city the budget and the schedule differences and as i mentioned i also made changes to make her feel good why am i understanding with her breakdowns but she cant be with my autism im not complaining everything i did was because i really meant it and i would still do it without a doubt but it kind of seems unfair and toxic i sent her a message apologizing since my intention was never to hurt her and telling her that i understood her but that she couldnt expect to have the same relationship that i have with o because i have known her all my life i also explained to her that it was not personal and that i went out with practically no one but she simply did not respond to me and it has been more than a month since i sent it i talked to my sister and another friend both nonautistic and they think it was my fault because i could just make an effort to go out or avoid telling e about going out with o but i really dont understand them making an effort to get out is not that easy and i thought that if someone was my best friend i was supposed to tell them everything i only told her because i got very nervous when o wrote that text to me and i wanted to talk to someone to calm myself down am i the one who is wrong,post-pandemic
any other quiet borderlines here i feel like nearly all the rage is directed inward at myself so much that a lot of people im close to will never know just how bad i can get i dont usually explode at people because im too afraid of damaging relationships so i let people walk all over me unintentionally i just isolate myself when im upset and self harm i know better done dbt twice but im not feeling mentally together enough to fight this i also feel like im extremely boring and too socially awkward and people become disinterested really quickly at times i really question whether i have bpd or just a really emotionally unstable flavour of adhd anyone else feel like this edit also hopefully this isnt breaking any rules but if anyone here wants to dm me im always looking for peoplel to chat with,pre-pandemic
hi im new here this keeps happening and it is starting to weight me down so i would like some input from other autistic people i am 24 years old turning 25 this year and i got a late diagnosis at 19 and as many autistic people relate it felt like a weight was lifted off my shoulders so many things started making sense and it was good however after i got my diagnosis ive seen many mental health professionals psychologists and psychiatrists and a significant amount of these professionals have told me that i am not actually autistic and im starting to believe them i am aware that sometimes people get the wrong diagnosis and that could be the case for me as well it would mess me up for a while though the thing is every argument that has been used to question my diagnosis has been something i think is wrong ive been told that i cant be autistic because im making eye contact or because i am too smart to be autistic recently it was because i have empathy usually id dismiss the comments but its happened so often that im starting to think im the one in the wrong i dont know i wouldnt be in so much distress if the reasons i had been given actually made sense with what i know about autism what do you guys think x200b edit this got more replies than i was expecting so im a little overwhelmed and unable to reply to everyone individually however i would like to thank everyone for the replies and thoughts its been comforting to know that im not alone in this experience and that i wasnt wrong to think that these professionals were operating on stereotypes so thank you a lot,post-pandemic
i feel like every time someone makes a comment about me even something as simple as i thought you might like this i have this need to ask the other person a lot of questions regarding myself like for example why do you think that would you define me as x why what am i really like do i come across as the kind of person who would enjoy x etc i think it has to do with the lack of selfidentity that comes with being bpd but i was wondering if anyone on this sub feels the same,pre-pandemic
literally every person i lay eyes on in the supermarket at work a school doesnt matter it gets exhausting lol especially when someone is close enough to my weight that i cant tell which one it is,pre-pandemic
ive seen so many different formats of assessments all containing different parts and i absolutely hate not knowing what to expect and i hate tests and its building anxiety the format of the assessment was 1hr initial appointment then a couple weeks later a 4hr appointment and at the first appointment he said we might not even need the full 4 hours what happens during that time though ive heard stories of weird games being observed and ive heard stories that sound like it was basically an interrogation does the one hour four hour format mean anything or indicate a certain test will be used should i do anything to prepare i already have a list of notes about current and childhood symptoms although i lost it thanks adhd and need to track it down asap also any generic advice or stories would be really appreciated i really dont like not knowing things to the point its an ongoing joke with my therapist lmao pls help thanks,post-pandemic
this just happened and im so pissed and shakenup about it i go to a boarding school and for meals student are supposed to eat at the dining hall i absolutely hate the dining hall having to eat there is so nerve wracking i found that going there with friends make it tolerable so thats what ive been doing today i finished my classes at 6 and i was too tired to immediately head to the dinning hall for dinner so my friends decided to go there without me after taking a few minutes to relax i felt ready to go but my buds were already done eating by the time i arrived i just couldnt bring myself to eat alone no matter how hard i tried just being in there all by myself made me immensely nervous ultimately i decided to walk back to my dorm to grab a tupperware which made me incredibly more anxious because my thoughts were running all over the place i felt like people would definitely judge me if they saw me packing food to eat elsewhere but i had to do what i had to do to eat so i gathered up the courage to go there and try to grab something to eat as i entered the dining hall i realized i should have probably asked one of the staff members there if i was allowed to take food to go ill students are usually the only ones allowed to do so and they simple said no i felt so defeated and dejected i was tremendously humiliated at this point i just walked back to my dorm i felt a part of me die on the way back its so dumb but i cant help but feel somber about the whole situation its so unfair i wish the staff members would have been more understanding regarding my circumstances ive dealt with body image issues and i have trouble getting myself to eat sometime due to the my unhealthy old habits i dont want to get into that because im better now but instances like this make me rather starve than deal with the anxiety that i have to face during evey fucking meal its excruciating and i dont understand why i wouldnt just be allowed to eat the food in my room instead i dont know what to do anymore,post-pandemic
since i was 8 years old i am now 15 my special interest has been squishmallows i have had new ones come and go pokemon the simpsons adopt me young sheldon but squishmallows has always been one of my special interests i have 227 of them every store i went to i would look for squishmallows some days i wouldnt be quite as interested in them but i never felt like i lost the spark well for the past three weeks or so it has absolutely felt like they have lost their spark i have gotten new ones spent time with them consumed related media and tried everything that would normally make me very happy but it just feels different i really dont want to lose squishmallows they are part of my identity and have been for almost 7 years of my life this was my only special interest that was constant and i dont want it to leave because im still so interested in them just not in the same way it just doesnt feel as interesting anymore so now i am crying and wondering how i can get it back the only thing i want is to get it back,post-pandemic

cw sh sa my ex so best friend since highschool and i got into a relationship within the last year or so and very recently they broke up with me we both stopped talking and seeing each other for a little over a month because i thought they wanted space or just didnt want to talk to me and last week they said they want to just be friends and at the time i was fine with it later that week i ended up having a breakdown over them and asking them why theyd just break up without talking about any of our problems and instead they just left and pretended like it was fine after i stopped splitting i realized some of the things i said and they said they were fine with it they know i have bpd and are ok with it and that they forgive me for what i said before this when we were still dating theyd send pictures of their sh to me without warning or asking it only happened twice but both times itd happened ive ended up relapsing myself theyve also promised to me theyd never drink again only to immediately relapse and instead of telling me they only told my ex and after said they understand if i never want to see or talk to them and how they always fuck up and how everyone always leaves them about halfway into our relationship we completely stopped having sex and i was fine with it they have past trauma so i didnt want it to seem like i was forcing them and at the time for personal reasons i was ok with not having sex i just figured wed eventually talk about it and go back to normal but when we were still together theyd often times be very forceful with me and if id tell them something hurt or that were being to rough theyd never stop or even slow down and i honestly feel like i was sad to some extent but theyre the one of the only irl friends i have and i cant bare to lose them i genuinely cant imagine life without them i just dont know what to do were both very traumatized and mentally ill so i give them some slack but i dont know if its gone too far atp,post-pandemic
pounding heart when youre sick its doing a good job fast heart rate during a hot shower its doing a good job pounding heart when exercising its definitely just doing a good job x200b ive noticed that my heart has many different behaviors and the cardiologist has said im alright at this point i think the most informed bet the occams razor is that my heart is just doing what its supposed to our bodies do not stay in one state they change in a million ways for a million different reasons every day ive started trying to think of my body as a compensation machine not in terms of covering up unhealthiness but in terms of youre healthy if your body is all over the place because its constantly adjusting to your current state bodies are systems that adapt in real time,pre-pandemic

i just spent about 4 hours going through the worst episode ive had in a couple of months and now i feel so logical and calm its ridiculous like i messaged my mum thanking her for tea asked my fp to call me later in a calm and reasonable manner wtf,pre-pandemic
ive seen a post on this before but it wasnt super helpful to my issue im not capable of saying i love you or being affectionate if im upset mainly if my fp did something to upset me he thinks i dont love him unconditionally and takes it really bad when i dont say it back before he told me he was okay with it but now its different i completely understand why he feels like that if the tables were turned i would feel the same way but it doesnt take away the fact its so hard for me disgustingly hard i need advice from fps or people without bpd to give advice but would totally like bpd opinions too this is a serious problem in my relationship and i want to fix it best i can,post-pandemic
not talking to neighbours and avoiding them my neighbours have an issues with it and say i should talk to them or at least say hi i remember one time when i sat in my car to avoid 3 of my neighbours talking by their car that i would have to walk past his wife came out and said she wont come out until you leave she said it loudly and angrily how do i stop caring what the neighbours think they stare aswell when i catch them staring they look away,post-pandemic

i was just wondering how were you guys able to quit the compulsive urges to check your symptoms and stop feeling so convinced that youre ill for example how were you able to fight the thoughts that tell you that if you dont pay attention or check your symptoms then something new will appear or youll miss something bad im currently struggling through this right now and wanted to see how everyone else did it,post-pandemic
i seriously dont think that this relationship will survive he is nice he is understanding and he tries his best but we are so so different that one day our capacity to understand each other wont be there anymore i am not sure how to put this but it feels like i am trying to say something to him and my words are unable to reach there its like a i am there but not there at this point i am not even sure why we are together so many times i have thought of breaking up with him i i even discussed this with him but somehow i am unable to do it i feel extremely lonely and exhausted i feel like i am sinking into a very dark place and i wont be able to survive i will keep on sinking and i will never see the lights again,post-pandemic
i constantly find myself reminiscing about when i was younger i did so much more and was a lot more active i was able to be content alone i kept myself preoccupied with tv books crafts and exercising these last few years i have found myself kind of doing less and as of late kind of nothing i will be good for a couple of months then its like i forget to live ill mainly just sleep eat work and take care of my kid pretty much doing the minimal daily thing so i guess i was just wondering if anyone else has gone through the same thing,pre-pandemic
by that i mean people who are say 25 with a confirmed diagnosis i know there is a lot of value to an open forum but it might be nice to have a group for people who have been living with bipolar for a while or at least are dealing with it as adults just wondering if anybody else feels the same follow up sorry to open this can of worms and then go silent im not feeling great right now so i got a little overwhelmed i think some people have misinterpreted my intent i wasnt proposing a split into an alternative sub and definitely not requiring proof of diagnosis i was just musing that there might be a niche for a community of older people who have gone through the diagnosis phase and are dealing with the challenges of living with bipolar through adulthood i arbitrarily said 25 thinking beyond university age im 41 i think rbipolarreddit is a great community and im absolutely not suggesting that anybody abandon it theres huge value in engaging with people with different experiences and its important that elder bipolars support those who are just trying to figure things out so forum could be an additional sub a weekly thread or something like a telegram chat just testing the waters but it seems as if theres some interest,pre-pandemic

basically what the title says i stopped the diets the calorie counting the obsessive behaviors everything at the beginning of this year i was so sick of letting my ed dictate everything in my life all i could think about was food and would restrictbinge this came from trying to lose the weight i gained through covid in all that time with all the restrictions dieting and calorie counting i literally didnt lose a pound i stepped on the scale for the first time since id done this and ive lost x pounds i wont share number as i know were not supposed to but it is a good amount of weight im a bit overweight so definitely a healthy weightloss my relationship with food and my body is better ofc still a very long way to go and i dont binge i dont restrict i eat what i want in moderation i eat in ways that make me feel good i think the biggest step in this journey was deleting any calorie counting app that was huge even when i really want to know the calories of something i dont let myself look it up practicing opposite action im even starting to forget calories of some foods i never thought that was possible im really happy and proud,post-pandemic

tonight a close family friend made plans for us to go out for an evening dinner ive been mentally preparing for this all week and went into it deciding to have a good night and calories dont count fast forward to the restaurant and i placed an order for a risotto dinner i was extremely happy and was enjoying some wine i havent been out of my house in three weeks so really it was a nice escape from everything well the meal comes out and it smelled delicious i was so fucking excited i started to take lil bites off it to just savor the taste immediately my heart completely breaks and i keep thinking is the risotto crunchy or my brain playing games with me i start questioning what the fuck is risotto is supposed to taste like since its been years since i had it at this point im fully convinced its gotta be the ed tricking me and maybe im supposed to have risotto stuck in my teeth and its part of the experience i must of made some faces because my friend says whats wrong i ended up telling her well youre going to hate me but the texture isnt right i offered her a taste of it and immediately she says its awful and calls over our waiter to announce the concern now let me state in my twentyseven years on this earth ive never sent a plate back there could be a garnish of hair and ill just kindly let the panic suffocate my mind instead of returning a dish i hate wasting food and i dont like causing discomfort for people so back to the rant before i could beg her to let me just take this meal to the face because well ive had worse i had to tell them my concerns and immediately im flushed with guilt shame regret and anxiety tears in my eyes thinking its my fault and i must not deserve to eat i must of apologized several times for the inconvenience ive been literally so sick to my stomach they manager ended up talking me into a second different entree and honestly it was so delicious but the whole time i couldnt fully enjoy eating im still questioning my concern over the food quality and thinking maybe it was my ed all along maybe my friend didnt share my thoughts but agreed with me to avoid any harm i dont know anything anymore i do know im scared of risotto for the rest of my life now,post-pandemic

tldr i plannedattending a group binge and i dread the compensation today im going with friends for a planned binge theres more to it than food but the purpose of the hangout is to eat half the group had suffered with a restrictive ed learned via them saying it and the others slightly care about calories so whenever we all see a snack that looks tasty theres collective unease and we plan for us to eat it together on one day eating a cookie after the gym is unnerving but eating several boxes everything else you delay on a random day in february is acceptable terrified bc i cannot back out didnt pay enough so im paying the host with labor cleanup the amount of caloric compensation ill need is gonna be insane the ex disordered half seem to have made peace by just restricting in the following days but their maintenance levels are high biggest fear is the weight ill gain i could not eat anything but i dont want to one friend kept tellig me itll be easier to forget abt the cals if you split it with me and i dont wanna leave them on their own no comments are wanted im saying this so i dont do anything out of panic,post-pandemic

i wanted to start a clubgroup for health anxiety at school or my town and i think forming it is the easy part but i do not really know what we would do ultimate goal would be to have a sense of community physically while supporting each other and advancing the awareness of health anxiety any ideas some ideas i have so far hosting a camping trip and having a bonfire where we write our ha triggers and then throw it into the bonfire an activity similar to american gladiator where you fight off your ha trigger hosting an art show depicting how ha makes us feel to better advocate and communicate to general public about ha writing a book similar to freedom writers a compiled book of diaries where the people depict how ha makes them feel day to day and other things that would help others understand what ha is and to not feel alone if they feel similarly hosting charity dinners to help raise funding for a group that specifically investigates health anxiety scientifically we need more studies inviting famous health anxiety researchersadvocates ex celebrities with ha or researcher gordon j g asmundson,post-pandemic

this is probably gonna be a wall of text since i just wanna get it all of my chest if you guys just came here for my question instead of the background info scroll down to the bold text at the bottom okay so heres the story i 22m have been struggling with all sorts of crap since primary school i was notoriously late the worst when it came to doing chores and always procrastinating and holding off things i needed to do untill the very deadline you all know what its like i read this exact story written by different people countless times here totally baffling when i first visited this reddit im not alone so i thought everyone on earth was having such a hard time doing mundane things i waded through the mud untill the senior year of highschool where stuff got harder and harder for me i eventually failed at maths physics chemistry so i had to do the year over this time i did get my diploma although i still failed maths with a 3710 and winged physics with 010 points away from failing again this time no retry available anyways the year after i went to my current college the academy of popculture and i think this is what saved me yet cursed me i always thought i wanted to do something with my hands and head create pretty stuff that was exactly what this school offered its extremely open and free the first year you get to follow a course but from the second year on you design your own projects you think of what you want to learn how you are gonna do it with whom and how you wanna be criticized by the teachers and the assessments this means alot of freedom and here is exactly where my problem arises when i pick a project and im working together with interesting people im working like crazy im thinking of awesome projects to do professional championships hide seek a band dedicated to performing next to the freeway at traffic jams i let my mind run wild at brainstorms create awesome stuff and make beautiful music with my band if im in the right flow when im not about 810th of the time i just always have this feeling that im underperforming and what is especially hard for me is the end of each semester i have to write a load of paperwork for the stuff i did and why i should receive my points i have been trying to get some points for 15 year now but im way behind always telling myself i can do it and each time i slap myself in the face and promise i will get some at the next assessments well we all know how that goes right i noticed i just started losing faith in myself its getting worse and worse in the beginning i was like i can do this shit lets get to it and i kind of winged it but now i feel like whatever i do its over my head and i wont ever graduate and i wont dare to think of my life afterwards but thank god i have the best girlfriend one could imagine apart from some desynchronised libido hehe but thats a whole other story she actually came up to me saying i might have add been reading up on it ever since and i all makes somewhat sense to me now dont know if this make sense but i can finally see what part of me is add and what part is actually me so warming to hear all you guys coming up with solutions stimulating eachother and all these recognizable stories all of them anyways after some deskresearch i figured i should go see a doctor made an appointment 6 months later yeah i know and she said i showed obvious signs of add but couldnt diagnose me herself so she sent me to a psychiatrist and this was 3 months ago i still need to make the appointment but im scared as fuck damnit or not even scared im actually anxious to go since i wanna do something about this crap im in i dont know why i dont do it its like all these conversations i had with people why im always late i do care about you and i dont know why im always late and i tried going to bed earlier that didnt work out damn you appointments damn you opening letters damn you days and days of just laying around in bed not wanting to get up damn you sitting behind your pc doing stupid shit while aching for bed but not going to bed till the sun starts to rise always when theres important shit coming up the next day damn you cold coffee damn you unanswered emails and goddamn you dishes although fuck yeah im happy i bought a dishwasher yesterday since i couldnt stand the frigging month old dishes my kitchen counter is empty now for the first time in years woo people look at me funny when i tell them i bought a dishwasher for myself that dude be lazy as fuck dont care much works for me but yeah im kinda frustrated as you guys might have noticed so after reading through this subreddit im actually aching to try medication or atleast seeking help but somehow this scares me too will my projects suffer from taking meds i totally rely on myself going from one crazy idea to the other and this is what i am actually being succesfull at will this go if it will i might just aswell leave school and quit filming and making music altogether i think ideas anyone experienced with this tldr so what i want is this the best of both worlds film day brainstorm day performing with my band i want my brain to run wild and go everywhere like everyone here knows the feeling close to a deadline with some pesky emails needing to be sent need to do some administration paying the bills or organising my projects in timetables or whatever can i then just take pills that help me concentrate on this dont procrastinate and get the stuff done i need to get done does it work that way i know these aint somekind of wonderpills i just wonder how flexible you can be with using them on and off got a long boring class i really need to pay attention to take an adderal to help me keep focused can i do this shouldnt i start getting meds in the first place with a job like the one i have id love to get some insights from someone please do tell me how much of an idiot i am for thinking it works that way but do elaborate im just reaching

it took me 8 years to mention to the public that i struggle with addiction i should have done it sooner but i guess i just wasnt ready im writing this to let people know they are not alone i released my first album lonely traveler back in 2004 there is then a long gap between records music is my world i continued writing songs and performing shows to help spread the word in support of lonely traveler but soon lost my way i was in and out of behavioral health units and rehabs for 2 to 3 years i had my last drinkgod willing on november 16th 2010 im lucky to be alive i was diagnosed with depression and bipolar disorder while in the behavioral health unit ive had panic attacks and anxiety since i was 12 years old panic attacks that were so bad i ended up in the hospital when they first started i had no idea what was happening to me i thought i was dying or having a heart attack they were very scary over the years ive learned to deal with them much better they arent as frequent or severe from the outside looking in youd never know i had any mental health ailments i always greet people with a big smile and my dimples do a good job helping cover up my darker days that being said i think all humans are depressed from time to time some definitely more than others i also feel addiction and depressionanxiety are cut from the same cloth i used alcohol to self medicate for years it worked for a long time to help with the pain until it didnt work anymore the wheels eventually fell off the bus and the train derailed from the tracks i write this to let those out there that are still suffering know that there is hope there is also nothing to be ashamed of admitting that you are sad or depressed or have an addiction problem is hard i can promise you though that once you face your demons and accept them youll feel relief when you do ask for help youll immediately feel relief once you surrender you start winning there is definitely still a stigma in regards to mental illness in general mental illness isnt treated the same as other ailments people feel sorry for those with cancer but not people with addiction problems i think the general public has come around more in the last few years but there is still a long way to go also there are some that truly understand that addiction is a disease the stigma isnt categorical among all people being a guy people commonly say ah get over it toughen up you shouldnt let this or that affect you you have nothing to be depressed about guess what depression anxiety and addiction doesnt need a reason furthermore showing your emotions is a sign of strength and not a weakness it takes more strength to show your emotions and feelings than to hide them in addition men have been taught to hide their feelings and remain stoic they dont want to appear weak or less than sometimes ill wake up sad for no reason honestly my life is absolutely wonderful and i have so much to be grateful for i literally have zero reasons to feel sad or depressed however there are some days where my head feels heavy like a thick gray cloud my thinking is muddled and the world feels like its caving in on me i cant explain it some days are just like that i tell myself that this too shall pass and it always does when im in that fog though it feels like the world is ending it is hard to function i then get mad at myself for not having the energy to be productive in these tough moments i need to remind myself that its okay i take paxil to help with anxiety and depression there is nothing wrong with taking medication to help you feel normal it doesnt make you weak ive also used meditation as another way to calm my mind another key ingredient to keeping myself in tip top mental shape is exercise exercise is the number one thing i can do in my life to help keep me healthy in general it really is that simple theres a trickle down effect exercise releases the happy endorphins such as dopamine in the brain i also use a lot of positive self talk to keep me in good spirits the mind is very powerful and will believe everything you tell it if youre feeling down or struggling with addiction nobody is going to shame you and those that do arent worth knowing the people that care about you most will support you they will respect you and they will be happy to see you happy if youre feeling low please call a friend or family member to chat friends and family have saved me many times over the years there is no shame in admitting you need help were all human and we all need help sometimes brett,pre-pandemic

so i beat my friends to their apartment last night after we all left the bar from celebrating said friends birthday i waited a few minutes in my car first time visiting the new place didnt know which apartment was theirs and then called them twice they didnt answer i waited another 5 minutes and immediately started splitting without doing my own research on bpd and the symptoms i never wouldve been able to catch this one thing would have led to another and i probably wouldve just gone home angrily thinking that they ditched me i suddenly realized that i was demonizing my friend in my head devaluing but im a fan of evil shit and getting worked up i immediately split him into the category of toxic person which makes me want to run and hide i noticed this and kept calm i acknowledged my emotions and let myself feel them but also told myself that they were uncalled for and that i just needed to be patient lo and behold they were in a dead zone and called me back all this splitting happened in just a few minutes but i disassociate into my own brain too hard sometimes and it felt like forever im so proud of myself for checking my rollercoaster brain for what feels like the first time,pre-pandemic

so recently ive been trying to work things out with my ex and hes been pretty nasty to me at times and at one point he called me a sociopath because i still wanted to talk to him even though he told me i was disgusting and a whore and this and that and after having abusive exes and an abusive mom and shit like that my ptsd allows me to completely disassociate when people abuse me i disassociate and compartmentalize without even realizing it and its like i do this shit with my mom because i love her and i do it with him because i love him and i just have this understanding that if i love them and want them in my life i have to take the abuse for a little while but wow it was an interesting realization,pre-pandemic
rant thank you for reading this i had to get it out though i have lapsed i have been humbled beyond the point of rehabilitation care or even human contact i make a pilgrimage to this empty place which took such effort to create and maintain to detriment of the believers who have long since passed beyond the pillars archers and alters of this church or have illuded the inheritance of their faith without the presence of inquisitive questions on my sullen reflection and wasted frame here i feel free to collect my thoughts and consider the faceted condition of my hunger first in soft restriction violent abstinence and a knowing cruel denial mea culpa mea culpa mea maxima culpa through my fault through my fault through my most grievous fault tracing first the circumference of the throat then my wrists and finally the palms of my hands i announce to myself ad maiorem gloriam et salutem for the greater glory and my salvation indulgentia propriae poenitentiae et vanitatis the indulgence of my own personal penance and vanity i have failed in my steadfast nature to hold to the principles of my purest indulgences within my disordered eating first anorexia by its cold will with its warm determination second nature to bulimia by its violent nature but comforting safety finally the complicated rule of drunkorexia which brought such clarity the vast effort seemed to be devoured by the complex characteristics of the impulses it has liberated me though some would see the principles of its doctrine as those of a master upon a slave free in unquestionable loyalty of devotion free from the action of will free in the adapted orchestrated influence fast restrict fail consume and slowly ever so slowly with a deliberate calmness in the absence of sound purge so violently the water splashes onto my face beyond shame pride or even satisfaction further to 40 days and 40 nights i anticipate the damage the sin the penance the characteristics of purgatory no geography of circles for my trespasses no ice no fire no sin no judgement no contrition no remorse to me and me alone beyond the places and the relationships of my anorexia bulimia and drunkeroxia there is no measurement of scale convalescence is uneasy dogma recovery is a doctrine which only left an unease of secession in heresy of deviation from the established faith of hunger an unease that i would be separated from the confidence of my convictions the faith that overcame the existential threat of support treatment and finally suffering in aggressive sadistic natural childlike state of grace thank you for read,post-pandemic
hi all short version im a parent of a nonverbal child with autism i built an ios visual timer app for my own daughter which has been helpful for her and for our family i am hoping a few of you with iphones or ipads would be willing to try it out and give me any and all feedbacksuggestions no cost or anything like that just beta testing the signup link is here long version my daughter has profoundsevere autism and is in a daily level 3 she cant talk and its unclear how much of what we say she understands her ipad app for communication is helpful but like many she has a lot of frustrations with transitions waiting and when she cant get or you dont understand what she wants one of the areas thats been troublesome at home and school is anyall transitions shes sometimes okay to wait a bit but doesnt have any concept of the difference between 5 minutes and an hour and when you keep telling her to wait for something she wants she gets very frustrated and gets aggressive etc ive tried a number of timer apps on the app store im in the apple ecosystem and most of them have a lot of great features but almost always miss things that are important for our family im an ios software developer for my day job soooo i made a fairly basic timer that shows the passage of time visually weve had a lot of frustration with some of the other ones available for various reasons many made ticking clock sounds and almost all of them allowed her to be able to cancel the timer or change it once it was started some of them had really nice choices of images that would fill in or be uncovered as the timer progressed but in many cases the main issue is that it was very easily messed with anyway so the app ive made hopefully addresses these issues very simple display lock out timer changes once its started etc if you force quit the app or switch to another one the timer continues and will send a notification when the timer expires if you return to the app before the timer expires even if you are freshly launching it after force quitting the timer will just continue without any time lost while the app wasnt running right now theres only an ios version sorry and its too early to say if there will eventually be an android or a web version though it would be interesting to know if those are desired also use the testflight invitation link at the top of this post to sign up to become a beta app tester youll need to install apples testflight app on the device but i think the signup thing walks through that bit as for the feedback itself testflight gives you thing you can tap to send an email and also easy way to send a screenshot or video or feel free to reply here thank you again andrew,post-pandemic

i had my life flash before my eyes not too long ago and ever since its like i gained a new sense of awareness never felt before ive realized i never lived for myself my whole life im reminded of that feeling i would always have when seeing others online or in public and even at home since i grew up neglected it felt like i was a statue there was this natural barrier between me and everyone else in such a way where you dont matter wasnt an anxiety but an accepted fact things happened around me and it was like i was a background character in my own life my thoughts feelings interests etc were all meaningless in such an unquestionable way it feels like walking home from school its the last day summer break is here but for you it means nothing except emptiness since you are stuck living in a dysfunctional household as you walk you see everyone else walk home excited often in groups chatting with each other its 3pm nearing 4 the sun is in the middle of the sky an orange glow mixed with a baby blue everyones eager and happy and all that but here you are alone no one looks at you no one comes up to talk to you you simply walk home knowing that emptiness will carry on with you or when you sit in your room and cry as a kid you want for someone to come and hug you you want your mom or dad to be gentle and loving and comfort you but no one comes if anything your mom opens the door to tell you to stop when you first hear that door open your heart bounces and you feel that anticipation that youll be saved instead you are met with being scolded more shame and guilt than before that lack of embrace feeling like a cold wind blowing right through you that level of emptiness the level of existential dread the sadness that turns into resentment for awhile and then goes away replaced with numbness it all feels melancholy and liminal the solution would be to just live life now now that im aware i should go about my days living life like itd be my last but the dread cloaks everything this life has been all ive ever known i truly dont know what living for myself feels like so its hard to picture i know things will get better but theres that constant dread thinking things will remain this way the emptiness quitting addictions is the probably the best thing im trying to do for myself atm its been so long dealing with them too i often worry if there is life after addiction sometimes i see nothing at all beyond that point nothing but staring into the void for once i see no future not in a bad way and not in a good way it just isnot even escapism works anymore,post-pandemic

im 43f currently on quite a few medications lithium lamictal latuda zyprexa olanzapine and asneeded klonopin as well as a few meds for physical health issues the hope was to add latuda and remove zyprexabut as has happened many times over the yearswe just cant seem to get me off of zyprexa without a manic episode or suicidal ideation or severe insomnia it sucks i have gained well over 100 pounds since starting meds including zyprexa in 2007 my new psychiatrist that i started seeing in january asked me to check if my insurance covers vraylar they do its affordable how do you think it would work to take me off of latuda and zyprexa and add vraylar instead i guess my psychiatrist would know how but i definitely dont want to be on three antipsychotics at the same time my pharmacist already gets red flags for me being on two latuda zyprexa what has been your experience with vraylar does it really work on both the highs and lows like it says on the ads is it really weightneutral,post-pandemic
its a bit of a hostile paraphrasing perhaps but wtf i really like zen pencils which are comics drawn around inspirational quotes but this part of the quote from james rhodes pisses me the fuck off youll know it when you see it to quote a world where people have simply surrendered to or been beaten into submission by the sleepwalk of work domesticity mortgage repayments junk food junk tv junk everything angry exwives adhd kids and the lure of eating chicken from a bucket while emailing clients at 8 pm on a weekend seriously seriously having a kid with adhd stops you from turning off the tv and practicing at something you claim to be passionate about try living your dream when you have a real problem you have no control over like uhm i dunno adhd noone gets to blame their kid with adhd for them not being able to live their dream having kids is voluntarily having kids takes time if you have kids they might have a disorder kids with disorders might take up more of your time these are all things any intelligent person is aware of before they make the decision to have children especially since theres probably a hereditary aspect to adhd you make your own bed you know who isnt to blame for any of the issues that arise from having a kid with adhd the kid they didnt ask to be born they certainly didnt ask to have a neurological disorder that almost seems designed to keep them being able to work stop using them as an excuse as to why youre not getting off your ass to practice the piano learn to draw or write that novel youre always talking about because that is exactly what they are excuses take it from someone who knows people with adhd know all about excuses and procrastination yet we still struggle to get shit done in spite of everything i am still an artist i work on my craft every single day i have practiced for years and years and i get my share of wistful i wish i could draw comments when people look at my work and for years i naively offered to help with books tips websites youtube tutorials and even free private lessons both offline and on you know what 99 of those people turned me down they had nothing to lose but a bit of time and effort a pencil and some paper and they still went nah and the 1 quickly tapered off into being an hour too late for their classes and not doing their tiny amount of simple homework sitting around talking nonstop instead like it was a social event i learned that i wish i could x just means i wish i could x without putting any effort in so now i just smile and nod when people tell me they wished they could draw and save my tiny amount of previous energy and focus on practicing my craft every single day tldr if you cant even turn off the tv to make time to practice what youre supposedly passionate about maybe you dont deserve to achieve your dreams,pre-pandemic
hello getting straight to the point im 25f in 2021 i developed a migraine which lasted for around 8 months i have always been obsessed with getting the perfect grades so i guess the pent up stress ended up causing me health issues i didnt really believe that it was due to stress or anxiety since i have always been like this and worried a lot over it it went away over time but at the end of 2021 i developed this burning sensation in my abdomen area which to date hasnt gone away i have tried different medications ranging from antiacids antidepressants aloe vera to ibs medication but nothing ever really seemed to work i dont feel like food really affects it but i still try to eat organic and healthy food i dont have any other symptom such as nausea or constipation its just this constant pain in the center of my chest which i feel like migrates around my abdominal area i also feel quite sleepy throughtout the day all of the tests i have had done have been normal but this pain doesnt seem to go away doctors tell me there is nothing wrong and since my digestive system is working fine they tell me to ignore it but its not really easy to ignore constant pain im lost on what to do does anyone else have a similar experience how did you deal,post-pandemic
the last year has been well shit i dont wanna be arrogant or stuff but once you are mature enough or smart enough you see how everything in society is just made to the expense of others i am in a stadium where i would kill myself if i didnt surpress any emotions i cant feel very much i lost my moral ethics and ability to bind i ponder through each day in a state of just being there everywhere i can see improvement but i lack the power to change stuff society seems like a bunch of idiots no matter where i go sadly my parents never forced me to believe in religion maybe then i could live with this burden and sometimes when i let my feelings out its just a burst of negativity moments that i hurt myself and am very close to finish it off i dont know how long i will be here how long till the next potential lethal phase i just wanted to write this down to all the people that had feelings towards me and to all the value a human life cause i never was able to give it back to you i know how it hurts you but in my state i couldnt care less,post-pandemic

i wish i could remember what it was like to live without drugs innocent and full of potential what was it like to be able to enjoy the simplicity and comfort of my childhood and early teens waking up to watch tv on saturday mornings with my siblings spending the day outside with my neighborhood friends even sitting in my bedroom listening to music not feeling the annoying itch of a craving a feeling that only intensifies until it is satisfied my lust for life faded as stimulants crept in and showed me a whole new world that i deemed worthy of chasing now i find it hard to even get out of bed without having anything to snort or pop or smoke i will put all plans for the day on hold until i can get a fix every so often when im at the peak of an adderall high or snorting a line of meth larger than life i am hit with disappointment i cant remember the last time i was sober in fact i dont even remember what sobriety felt like i hope that one day i will have the courage to find out,pre-pandemic

so tomorrow im celebrating 6 years of continuous sobriety this is the strangest anniversary ive had so far and i really want to talk a little bit about emotional sobriety for a minute and the ridiculous pressure that people in recovery sometimes put on themselves to act their age this may be the longest period of time that ive been away from a drink but this past year has been the most challenging year ive experienced so far and i have felt closer to a drink than i ever have in previous years i am not sharing this for congratulations or for attention i was not planning to acknowledge my anniversary publicly at all this year actually because i always feel kind of weird about doing that but as i was journaling today i somehow ended up writing a novel about it so here we are this is actually really embarrassing and i acknowledge that i am completely blowing up my own spot on the internet to people that i do not know and that do not have the first clue about my past because ive been very careful to protect it but i feel like this is also important im attempting to be vulnerable right now because brene brown says vulnerability is a good thing and brene brown is bae but im also terrified of judgment i really hope this doesnt come off as preachy or egotistical because that is not me at all im putting myself on blast because if theres anyone out there right now who feels the way i felt this year hopefully something i say might be helpful to them hopefully they dont drink this year has been very hard to say the least i work full time during the day and have class 4 nights a week some days until 10 im tired overworked overwhelmed broke my own fault and pretty depressed most of the time im too busy to adequately take care of myself most days im really struggling to consistently eat well sleep enough get to the gym and be of service in any capacity i only get to one or two meetings a week if that and im not sponsoring anybody because i dont have time i started smoking again and really want to stop but you know how that goes im also having a hard time being present in my relationships i might be there physically but emotionally i am miles away i wake up every day and i feel trapped every time i come up for air another random wave that i didnt see coming knocks me out and fills my lungs with metaphorical water some days i literally feel like i cant breathe like there is just this invisible weight coming down on my chest and crushing me hour after hour day after day its insufferable at times there are brief reprieves but generally its been rough i promise ill get to the hope soon as the result of being too tired too busy or lets be honest too unwilling to work on myself during this period ive watched my general emotional state slowly decline and to be frank ive thought about drinking a lot if someone randomly brings up alcohol in conversation lately i actually start to disassociate right in front of them they are still talking to me about whatever but my mind is somewhere else trying to remember what alcohol feels like when it first hits your stomach ive felt extreme jealously toward coworkers of mine who go to happy hour after work or go home after a long day and drink a glass of wine on the couch or in the bath to unwind ive scrolled through instagram stories of friends drinking paused them and felt myself get really uncomfortable as i started to imagine what their drinks taste like i felt jealousy toward my family members who were all drinking white claw and enjoying our beach house weekend last month while i was drinking la croix i often sit and wonder what it might be like to sit around a dinner table with my friends eating good food and drinking good wine i got sober at 19 and never got to experience what thats like ive never had one glass of good wine in my life franzia and barefoot foreverlt3 and i never got to try a white claw gah ive been finding myself feeling like im missing out on something recently and this makes me really sad and really angry all the time especially because i know and 100 understand that this is insane thinking that im missing actual nothing and that drinking will never improve my situation ive done enough drinking for one lifetime but this is just the reality of what alcoholism and recovery looks like for me sometimes for the last week or so as my anniversary has gotten closer ive been reflecting on the last year and ive felt incredible shame and guilt about this although ive been physically sober for a while now my brain overwhelmed by these feelings of failure for missing the mark on self care and for experiencing this recurring obsession about alcohol again has told me that i dont deserve to celebrate this milestone i know this shit sounds wild because i am definitely physically sober but in my brain its 100 real and very intense if you know you know my boyfriend asked me if i wanted to do anything for my anniversary and i basically shrugged and said no because i just didnt want to make a thing about it this year it all felt wrong ive been talking about this to those who are close to me and the more i share about it the more i begin to realize that nothing about this experience is a failure ive gone through this before in recovery but never to the extent that i am right now and thats ok it doesnt mean that im doing it wrong that im doomed to relapse or that theres something wrong with me its just part of the process right now things are challenging at the moment for sure but things are also beautiful and transformative i really dont know shit at the end of the day but if theres one thing i do know its that everything is temporary and these feelings will pass nothing that im going through right now is bad and not one single thing that i am doing at the moment would even be possible for the me of 6 years ago so thats pretty cool everything im facing right now is a gift and is the direct result of a life ive worked so hard for a life ive been given a second chance to live a life i legit almost lost almost 9 years ago i dropped out of high school because my addiction took over my life and i couldnt face failing i moved to florida to run away from the mess that i made back home i was so ashamed and humiliated about who i was and everything id done 8 years ago the doctor told me my liver enzymes were too high at age 18 7 years ago i could not get through one day without putting a substance into my body i couldnt even take a shower sometimes because i was so sick 7 years ago i could barely hold a job even working for my dad slinging ice cream 7 years ago i quit college 6 years ago i had already been to 3 rehabs and 5 detoxes within a 3 year period 6 years ago after getting arrested i told a co in jail to go fuck themselves and lost my license for a year 6 years ago i was sent to the er in an ambulance on 2 separate occasions in less than 90 days 6 years ago i almost lost my life in a back alley next to a dumpster so 6 years ago i made a decision i decided that alcohol would no longer be my master no matter how hard life got or how unbearable my feelings became i made a decision not to to drink or use drugs no matter what one day at a time and ive made that decision for 2190 days in a row now something that ive learned these last few years is that recovery is not linear and anyone who tells you that or who makes you feel like sobriety is nothing but peace and serenity all the time is a fucking douchebag everything is always changing and shifting the only constant in my life is not drinking emotional ups and downs are still normal for me and ive had to learn how to become malleable and how to experience intense emotions without running away or letting them consume me they way they used to maybe your experience in sobriety is or will be different than mine but my recovery so far has been littered with periods of really intense darkness followed by periods of pure happiness and peace its always worth it though and im grateful every day life did not suddenly become easy when i got sober like i thought it would maybe for a little while my pink cloud probably lasted a year or two but ive learned that the world and the people in it do not owe me anything as time goes on i still feel pain regularly i still have bad days i still randomly burst into tears in my car sometimes when a song comes on that brings up past trauma and im still afraid all the fucking time no matter how many fears i face along the way what has changed is my ability to stand my ground and experience everything good or bad that life has to offer i do not run you may be confused about why i would day dream about something as innocuous as drinking wine around a table with my friends when i just revealed that i overdosed on a literal curb next to an actual dumpster 6 years ago because that is one wide margin of delusion but addiction is a subtle foe my addiction may sound like me and think like me but its something else entirely its like a virus that waits patiently for the perfect opportunity to strike it will plant an unrealistic image in my head when im tired weak and vulnerable and like a virus it disguises itself as part of me so that ill let it slip past my defenses undetected the idea will take root and grow and meander through all of the dark corners of my mind like a vine latching onto my insecurities and fears and refusing to let go it tells me it will be different this time it tries to convince me that i was just a dumb kid with a lot of trauma and no coping skills but now im a grown ass adult ive been to therapy and god dammit i deserve a glass of wine after a hard day i was ashamed to admit that i had been feeling this way to my support group because well i shouldnt still feel this way with 6 years of sobriety whatever the fuck that means before getting sober i always had this misconception that someone with a year or more of sobriety had it all figured out most of us feel this way in the beginning i thought they were spiritual giants and i put them up on pedestals i honestly thought they were better than me i truly hope nobody ever feels that way about me the longer ive been sober the less sober time actually matters in the grand scheme there is no golden year or amount of time that we reach and the growth just stops the journey doesnt just end and im grateful for that the journey is what i signed up for in the day is where life happens for me and more and more thats where i try to stay even though im sober i can still be a piece of shit sometimes im still mean for no reason some days i experience rage envy and hatred im so selfish impatient impulsive and i cant make good financial decisions at all most of the time i still have to make amends when im wrong which happens to be a lot and i am constantly beating myself up for not meeting my own unreasonable standards and expectations but i am also getting better i am often kind generous hardworking loving ambitious adventurous passionate thoughtful and honest i own my shit today and i take responsibility for my actions sobriety has given me the ability to take an honest appraisal of myself and to love myself for not just my great qualities but also for all of my faults and flaws as well with each year that passes i learn more about what it truly means to love yourself and to love others sobriety has given me the opportunity to know myself to know who i am at my core and not shy away or crawl out of my skin when things are hard to look at sobriety has given me every single good thing that i have in my life today it has given me the ability to see others and to let them see me to love unconditionally in a healthy independent way and to experience the other side of true hopelessness but most of all sobriety has given me a choice i never had that before and i refuse to give that up for the delusion of drinking one glass of wine on the couch while watching ghost adventures on a thursday night because 1 thats dumb and 2 the reality of that delusion is as follows me two bottles of gas station wine deep wandering around in the dark screaming at ghosts to come fight me so if any of my sober peeps feel this way right now especially my young friends its ok if your time in sobriety is not an accurate measure of what you feel your character or your life should reflect at this point i know that we all know this to some extent but a lot of us still feel shame when it happens to us and we still try to hide it by putting on an act that everything is fine and if youre newly sober or wanting to get sober please dont let anything ive said deter you ive only made one good choice in my life and that was getting sober every other good choice that followed was just the result its ok to be honest when we feel like weve missed the mark its ok to be vulnerable about this its ok to let people see the truth of what recovery looks like sometimes its ok if youre not ok right now we still deserve to celebrate grateful for today love yall,pre-pandemic

im seeing a lot of posts on here with members of this community excusing other members for their blatant abuse of their partners it is unacceptable it is not our fault that we have ptsd but it is out responsibility to keep it in check and not harm others the amount of blame im seeing being put on the partners of members of this community after a person with ptsd has an outburst and abuses them is unsettling at best and triggering at worst imagine if someone was excusing your abuser in this way x200b edit i was really expecting to get burned at the stake for this post but the fact that we were all able to come together and talk about the elephant in the room and find a place of accountability and community makes me really happy thanks guys,pre-pandemic
were writing this in part in response to some popular posts we saw recently and partly in response to a trend weve noticed here this isnt aimed at anyone specifically nor is it an official rulewe have no desire to gate keep or alienate anyone however this is a subreddit centered around a medical condition and those living with it and wed like to keep things medically accurate as much as possible without any judgement or ranking of what is worse we encourage everyone to only use medical terms in ways consistent with the medical literature including terms like mania if you describe something as a manic episode when it is not a manic episode its confusing for everyone we cant offer any help or commiseration when we dont know what is going on its certainly true that the line between mania and hypomania can be a bit fuzzy were not talking about that if there are more than one reasonable and informed opinion that happens but when people describe mania as a welcome and productive event that flies in the face of the diagnostic criteria which require a severe impairment in functioning that is often accompanied by psychosis and hospitalization when someone describes themselves as being currently manic or experiencing a manic episode we think of high levels of impairment potentially including psychosis and loss of insight hypomania can be imparing too especially socially but does not involve the same level of impairment and potential medical emergency as mania another thing that is often ignored here is that for an episode to be considered manic the symptoms and impairment must last at least a week or require hospitalization we understand that some people have slightly shorter episodes and that in the middle of an episode you dont know how long it will last but an episode lasting less than a few days does not qualify as a manic episode hypomania can be shorter with the official requirements being only 4 days minimum but if your symptoms are lasting less than that and have triggers caffeine life events its not necessarily a bipolar episode some amount of change in energy levels over time is not necessarily pathological we hope everyone can understand why we feel this way and that this is not meant to be an attack on anyone we also hope that realizing the full extent of harm caused by mania will help everyone be more understanding when it changes the way someone interacts here or when someone seeks advice on repairing strained bank accounts and personal relationships from ussnakeggirl and umymainismythrowaway1,pre-pandemic
to the sweet old man at the donut shop when you saw me carefully select and buy 8 huge donuts you know like the cinnamon roll and apple fritter type donuts and joked at me you must be hungryif only you knew if only you knew that i had just eaten three pastries at home and rushed over to the closest shopping center from my house breaking the speed limit for these donuts if only you knew that right after i left the shop i would take these donuts to my strategically parked car and eat almost every single one of these by myself and in a single sitting until i was writhing in severe pain so bad that i wouldnt even be able to drive away until my body actually got some time to digest some of the food if only you knew that no i wasnt just hungry i was fucking famished to drown my agony in donuts even despite the fact that i did the same thing last night as well if you knew you probably wouldnt be laughing at your own joke anymore you would probably be mortified at your own words disgusted at the behavior and sympathetic toward me if only you knew but thats okay you didnt know thats why i laughed are your comment too thats why in my eyes youre sweet you probably thought i was taking these donuts to my friends or family talking and laughing in between bites of these pockets of saccharine goodness you probably thought there was no way a 52 girl would ever possibly eat all of these on her own maybe if i were 300 lbs you wouldnt have said such a comment but thats okay because from the outside it doesnt look like im suffering from an eating disorder so theres no way you could possibly know to the sweet old man at the donut shop i hope you enjoy that single donut that you purchased yourself and remember me as the girl who laughed at your joke and bought donuts to share with others i wouldnt want to burden your day with my issues i want you to remain comfortable enough to continue joking with strangers i dont want you to know edit i cant believe i got so many compliments on my writing i literally whipped this up randomly and quickly as i was waiting for my food to digest a little before i could drive away from the parking lot after that binge and i wasnt expecting this kind of response at all i can get a bit insecure about my writing and these comments honestly made me absolutely delighted like maybe im not such a worthless loser lolnowif only i could believe people in the same manner when they actually call me pretty or not fat lmao,pre-pandemic

you know those clothes you pull out and try on before going out but you cant make up your mind or those clothes that you take off at the end of the day which are too clean to put in the wash has anyone found an adhd methodhacksystemanything of putting them away im fine with kitchen jobs vacuuming bathroom jobs etc but clothes feels like the last hurdle that i constantly struggle with and really affects my mental health just always having clothes fcking everywhere feels like ive tried so many things putting them away after using putting on bed so i have to clear them before i sleep just putting them in the wash anyway having a separate laundry basket for them but again give it a week or so later and boom there they are a pile of half clean clothes probably mixed with dirty clothes probably mixed with other stuff urghhh,post-pandemic
written on the fly my experience with it is that its only a disorder if you try to live the way our culture wants you too the culture that seems only to prize constant economic growth so it gives you things to do with your life that are focused on promoting that growth and those options are miserable for lots of folks and great for typeas and others like sociopaths but for those of us who identify as adhd its constantly aggravating you see so much similarity with the shambles our lives become as we constantly try to keep up with all the things you have to do to keep the growth going ive seen so many stories of shame selfloathing and sadness because you just cannot seem to get life done it is a battle every 15 minutes every day to check your focus to not upset your spouse because a chore was forgotten or be viewed as unreliable by peers because you have issues with being ontime or you spaced out on a task you can become fearful of what others think and hide out and wish you were differentthat is what a culture focused primarily on economic growth gets you it cares about performance over selfworth having an issue regulating your attention is a disorder in such a society because you are viewed as labor and a resource and are expected to function as such its all inputs and outputs and metrics very rightbrained very industrial and so only from that perspective is it a disorder i have found island cultures tend to mesh well with attention issues it is a slower paced what is needed to live well is much less there tends to be an actual emphasis on family as opposed to lip service we give here like shaming people who move back home all those things make life easier because there is not as much competing for your attention and that which does positively reinforces a way of being that lets you flourish as you were made which benefits us all in ways that often cant be quantified versus a way of being that treats you as a cog does not share in the growth you generated and prefers you drug it up to cope with the misery of making other people money from an air conditioned cage and the drugs are not just ritalin they are also found in our food and they affect your attention significantly im not anti gmo or anything i try to stick for fish for meat but who doesnt love bbq im just talking about eating cleanly mostly organic plant matter and how if you suffer from attention issues and you radically change your diet you will see how it helps your attention you are literally taking yourself off drugs by doing this i dont believe any of this is a conspiracy we got here piece by piece as a culture that is like thisbut consider that your rapid attention gives you awareness and you are perfectly aware living how they suggest is not working so now be aware that you dont have to do it their way and love yourself it is so hard after years of beating myself up take none of this that i am living super well with my adhd i still get so sad sometimes but i get present with it i am aware it is a result of years of learned behavior and i sit in that awareness and i breathe,pre-pandemic
ive been there i thought that i might see something that will ease my mind but you all know how it goes it makes it all worse and worse out of the 100 times i checked a symptom online only 10 of them kinda made me feel safe all the others made shit worse and worse its better if you just call your doctor and ask him or even better go there to check it rather than passing through the stage of complete panic an internet symptom article would give you we all know that even a slight headache might have some kind of scientific article that makes it look like the possibilities of it being cancer are high or smth like that,pre-pandemic

soooo buttons i know you spend a lot of time on here you tease me because i am not as tech savvy and mostly just use facebook to save vegan recipes and argue with homophobic republicans which you hate and always say is not healthy for me probably true but i finally downloaded the app to post this half hoping you would see this and half hoping you wouldnt we cant seem to have a real conversation since i discovered your recreational use of painkillers has escalated to a full blown addiction i use the term discovered lightly since i think you wanted to get caught by me not the cops not your family not your best friend who is also your sponsor from your adolescent meth addiction me so that begs the question what is my role here i have spent the last week alternating between becoming an expert on opioid addiction and forensic grade lie detection i have foregone my own basic needs to make sure you arent using i stay up at night and think back on the last year which is when you said the addiction started and have become a brilliant mind in timelines and flow charts of people places and lies my adeptness at this has resulted in the realization this addiction has likely gripped you for the greater part of our relationship 7 years in march probably in large part due to my own occasional use in the last week i have turned the home we were once so proud of into nothing less than an intensive inpatient therapy unit i drive you to meetings not knowing if you will stay or leave to find some shady dealer i deal with your urine and your putrid sweat i see you hold your hands out for your suboxone like a pauper begging for bits of bread and i find it disgusting i think back on all the times you could have odd and i hate us both when i first met you i was so attracted to you you were so self aware intelligent and well read you were so in control of your mind but so awkward with yourself our first date you were so nervous and sweet i loved that about you so what now how do we come back from this statistically according to my late night research at least we have a 1 in 76 chance once i factor in that i am pretty sure you still arent being totally honest with me i think it leaves us at a 1 in no chance i am lost in this five feet of darkness and lies between us please come find me and bring a bright fucking light to shine in every ugly and humiliating corner becuase that shit doesnt scare me just dont shut me out kapish love pickles,pre-pandemic

hey folks i was assessed and diagnosed about six months ago 40 year old male it made my life make sense am picking up the pieces and living with a lot of grief after a divorce 10 years married and still love her a great deal but medication has been a help in making sure i actually take care of myself in practical ways and move my life forward my doctor started me on 30 mg vyvanse which was effective but the crash could be horrible the depression and feelings of pointlessness were scary id read about other people splitting their doses and decided to try that doing a water suspension and it helped a lot the crash was still there but it was mostly physical id feel like a dummy for an hour or so after the meds wore off but not depressed but it still wasnt ideal and didnt address a lot of my symptoms my doctor decided to try me on 125 mg of mydayis its been a big improvement no more crash and i feel like a more productive focused version of my full self but the duration is a lot shorter than the 16 hours they advertise the third phase comes on only 6 hours after taking the medication and by hour 9 i dont feel medicated at all the next highest dose is 25 mg i think i need a higher dose later in the day but not double the first part of the days effects are pronounced enough i dont want more i just want to be functional through the end of the day its a great medication but i really dont understand why they dont have a dose between 125 mg and 25 mg anyone experience anything like this with mydayis if so how have your doctors addressed it,post-pandemic

so i left this sub for awhile and thought that i was on the road to developing a somewhat healthy relationship with food but since looksmaxxing has spread all over tiktok i just cant help but feel like i have no control or discipline it seems like everyone is glowing up or cutting or going through some sort of physical upgrade that makes recovery 10000x harder mentally why do i have to be sick to be pretty how do i even justify gaining weight and looking worse than i used to,post-pandemic
ive been in recovery for close to a year now it wasnt by choice but it saved my life at the beginning of recovery i hated everything and everyone but now i dont really care i kinda fell into this routine of go to the treatment place get weighed explain how im feeling and then go in another three weeks however since im still a minor the appointments were made by my mom so i never knew when my next one would be until my mom told me my last appointment was at the beginning of january and it is now the end of february and nothing they havent reached out to my mom at all this is has lead me to believe that they either gave up on me or they think im fully recovered and i dont t need help anymore im not complaining about it though they werent the sweetest people on the planet but it wouldve been nice to get told whats going on but with their track record of keeping my parents and me in the dark a lot im not surprised,post-pandemic
i 26f would like to share a personal struggle thats been on my mind lately the difficulty of making deep connections despite being adept at making surfacelevel ones having relocated five times to different citiescountries ive noticed a pattern while i can easily strike up conversations and make acquaintances mostly oneonone rather than in groups forming lasting bonds seems tricky for me recently during a welcoming week at my new internship i couldnt help but notice how effortlessly some people clicked and formed tightknit groups while i found myself drifting between conversations without truly feeling connected this scenario isnt unique to my current situation its a recurring theme throughout my travelsdifferent experiences plus i always end up spending most of my time by myself and when i reach out to people everyone seems busy all the time reflecting on this ive come to realize that my reluctance to open up and fear of vulnerability may be keeping me from cultivating deeper connections despite outward appearances i often grapple with feelings of avoidance and low selfesteem i have always been determined to find my tribe and cultivate a sense of belonging which explains my frequent relocations if youve experienced something similar or have any advice on navigating the complexities of forming genuine connections amidst a sea of superficial interactions id love to hear from you,post-pandemic
i recently got diagnosed a month back and was wondering how long the whole titration process and finding the right medication takes i started out on rubifen which worked in blocking out the external distractions but didnt really quieten my inner thoughts it also lead to an increased heart rate and jitteriness moved on to ritalin which doesnt have the side effects of rubifen but also didnt fully work in reducing my inattentiveness ive now been moved onto dexamfetamine and im hoping it works because i start uni by the end of this month the reason im asking this is because from what ive seen online after taking their meds people describe it as instantly working and everything quietening down for them and clicking is the experience ive described a normal part of the titration process,post-pandemic

about a year ago and more so in the last six months ive refound religion i found focusing on keeping god and his will on the forefront of my mind has helped me with my meds reduce the time i waste and make chores easier the love for my so also helps religion has helped me the most by far with kicking a porn habit i was addicted both physically and emotionally religion helped to end the emotional component by filling the hole in my soul and by softly minimizing my over inflated ego the porn habit had exacerbated the adhd does anyone have similar stories edit i didnt post this in ratheism i dont object to atheism science nor philosophy can firmly and scientifically deny or confirm the existence of a god or divinity only fundamentalist atheism such as what atticusmas is advocating i also object theologically and depending on how its practiced personally to fundamentalist christianity the religious thoughts i am specifically referencing is a mix of christian orthodoxy with some roman catholic and anglican speakers and buddhist taoist and classical philosophical thinkers included moderate islamic speakers concerning the islamic science of sufism started my soul searching and my attempt at humility before god there are humble saints and arrogant jerks in each religion the humbles almost always have gems of truth to share i understand the odd oppositional defiant disorder aspect of adhd as well as the emotional aloofness seen with many adhders including myself both lend to atheism but if egotism and materialism are set aside religious practice and is easily viewed as a true holistic and peaceful answer to life,pre-pandemic

please read does anyone else feel like i do i think im going to just stop its an emotional rollercoaster that leads me to having hope ive found someone who likes me for me and it ends with them not wanting to see me anymore i started seeing this guy anthony at the very beginning of december i actually used to date him in 2022 but i was so unstable i was not emotionally available and kind of using him to distract myself from my life i got bored and ended it with him i ended up being hospitalized for 14 days not long after and then right after that i ended up getting into a relationship later at the end of the year that didnt end welll fast forward to october 2023 i noticed anthony requested to follow me on instagram again so that means he unfollowed me when i was posting with my ex then randomly decided to follow me again well i was single and so i texted him i had plans to move to northern ca where i used to live this febuary so i told him i was leaving but said we could still have fun and maybe stay in touch when i leave well i was so nervous for that first date but it went so well he made me feel so comfortable to be myself the conversation was great and we were laughing hard he even took me out to super nice places and we had a lot of fun that night we had an intimate moment and he was holding my face and kissing me and said i missed you so much i really missed you i believed him we started seeing eachother once or twice a week since then it was going too well we have the same views on things and we share the same hobby camping and hiking we also like the same kind of music we made great memories he would text me all the time and often first it got more intense as time went on at one point he ignored my messages for two days so i asked him if he was ghosting me and he said no he had a rough two days i told him i cared about him and he said he cared about me too he would tell me like jokingly dont leaaavvee about me moving one night he told me he wanted to play some songs we laid down and turned off the light and he fucking played julia by the beatles my name is julia its a beautiful song that goes ocean eyes windy smile so i sing a song of love julia i was so shocked and loved it i had wanted someone to play that for me my whole life he played it cool and tried to play another song after to brush it off but it meant a lot to me it means he was listening to it on his own maybe later on i said in a text that was the most romantic thing during this all i would tell him and insinuate how i feel about him he knows i sometimes dont have a filter the last night we had before i moved was amazing we talked for hours and held eachother i ended up telling him in depth about my bipolar and all my attempts and everything ive been through he was so kind he said youve been through so much and you came so far i told him how because of that it means a lot for me to move to northern ca he said i could be selfish and want you to stay but im really happy for you there were plans he was going to visit me and we even looked at flights we even made a light comment about him moving there we said our goodbyes and he said we can send eachother care packages and he will visit well i drove 11 hours and things ended up badly my housing fell through and i couldnt find a place i was messaging him just a little bit and told him my situation then i became hypomanic my friend saw me and told me later she could tell and was scared i sent him a message like i wish we could be together forever but maybe we are destined for a passionate love affair with more embarassing things i told him he raised the bar for me of how i want to be treated and more he responded nicely but that message was crazy i ended up coming back home when i got home i apologized for the messages explained how my mental health was affected and i had an upswing and during that mindset i usually dont have a filter and told him i was back he sent a really sweet message saying he was sorry i was struggling and it takes wisdom to decide to come back etc etc he texted me first the two days after asking how i was doing about a week later i went to his place and we had amazing freaky sex for like 3 hours i spent the night and went home the next day we texted a bit about how that was a great time and thats it that was a week 12 ago i sent two messages right after that and he didnt read them or respond he hasnt texted me since usually we talk almost every day i texted him last night and he didnt respond for hours later and said a dry response how he was cleaning that day i replied and he never responded he knows how i feel he saw me cry bc i was sad to leave him im starting to think that he felt comfortable being romantic with me and letting me be vulnerable since i was leaving now that im back the clear path is a relationship and now he goes cold im so sad he was just using me for sex i was so real and vulnerable and i trusted him so i let my wall down and told him always what i was thinking and feeling that was a mistake and if someone does decide to be with me its only a matter of time before bipolar scares them away i give up on dating after this i cant handle the rejection i cant handle getting into a relationship again just to watch their feelings change im sick of dating where they use me for sex and then drop me before it gets serious im so deeply sad about this and for getting my hopes up im tired of getting bare minimum from men ive never been romanced or brought out to fun dates be told im beautiful be consistent and text me first i never had any boyfriend get me flowers or leave thoughtful notes or sweet thoughtful things i am always the one doing these things this guy brought me out for dinner and drinks twice and tells me im pretty and gives me some pda and i fall for it even though its the bare fucking minimum where is the guy that wont hesitate or make me wonder how he feels about me wheres the guy who brings me flowers on a date who leaves me a note in the kitchen saying i love you who plans cute dates like park date or beach walk or picnic or doing fun things like a museum or something this guy took me out twice to a dinner and then a bar and opens doors for me and i thought wow hes amazing thats so sad its the bare fucking minimum but my standards were so low i fell hard for that my past 3 relationships are with awful men who did not do anything romantic and treated me badly im going to be alone for the rest of my life never knowing what its like to be treated well i get jealous hearing about men who show up for their woman and treat them suprise them do romantic things and are 100 down for them no hesitation it seems like ill never get that,post-pandemic

two months ago i went to my psychiatrist after being stable for a year and asked her for adderall i made a total fool of myself what i didnt realize is that i was on a downward spiral all of my responsibilities have been unmanageable but i didnt realize it slowly but surely my mental health declined until it was affecting me physically i was having acid reflux that was so severe it was making me vomit even though i take zantac every night the reflux was worse when i was late to work every day so it was happening because of stress i havent been myself in months a couple of days ago after i quit yet another job i realized i need a time out but we need an income i dont want ssi just time to get healthy the welfare office agreed to give me cash assistance if i got a medical waiver saying i cant work i fully expected my doctor to say no i thought asking for six months off was too much but she agreed with me she told me she knew from experience that a person who has been stable asking for a control is a sign theyre slipping she said she knows how hard i work and its understandable that i need a time out my doctor gave me eight months minimum she will let me have up to 12 months if i need it im going to use this time to completely overhaul my life and get help it just feels so damn good to be validated,pre-pandemic

i excelled in school for most of my childhood until late 4th and 5th grade my parents split the summer going into 5th grade and the breakup was ugly my dad was already a drug addict and abusive before this but it became significantly worse after they split in my 5thgrade year i spent time in survival mode for whatever reason and i began struggling in school especially in math i tried everything and every night i had math homework it was hours spent with my mom that would ultimately end up in arguing and crying which did cause damage to my mom and is relationship going between my mom and is rocky relationship and then living with my dad the other half of the time where i was being emotionally abused and neglected i stopped prioritizing school i failed the 5th grade but was waived on to middle school since then i have struggled in school especially in math i cheated in math through school to get a passing grade i graduated with my associates degree last year but now im working on my bachelors degree when i found out i would be required to take two more math credits it now has me seriously contemplating dropping out of college the thought of taking more math courses makes me anxious and cry every time i try to consider it i feel so silly trying to explain this to others and they always reply with ill help you or you can get a tutor when thats not the issue i feel like i have a mental block and the information wont be retained because i get reminded of what life was like for me at that time its frustrating for me i want to become a therapist so badly but feel so stunted by other people because i cant get ahead of this one thing holding me back i wish there was a way for me to get waived from the courses but obviously thats not possible its so overwhelming and i feel extremely embarrassed and just ultimately defeated hopefully this makes sense im going to talk with my therapist about this next week im hoping someone else on here will relate and that im not alone in this ive already been diagnosed with ptsd and i try to be sensitive to myself but i get so frustrated thinking about this,post-pandemic

hey everyone im based in new zealand to cut a long story short after a five year battle with alcoholism i was convicted of assault threatening to kill threatening behaviour a dui and driving without a license this was in october 2022 ive been sober since and in 2023 i started studying a bachelor of health science specialising in mental health and addiction at university this is my second degree i already have a bachelor of commerce majoring in political science and economics however after realising that i dont enjoy the bachelor of health science and its not for me i dropped out i potentially have a dairy farming job lined up i was a dairy farmer during the five years i was an alcoholic however my parents who i live with are trying to force me to study something else they want me to do my masters in political science because they dont want me to go back dairy farming they say its a dead end job and that i wont have time to do anything because ill be working such long hours i really dont wanna do my masters and i dont have many job prospects at the moment until the clean slate act kicks in and my criminal record is sealed so my only option is to go back dairy farming but they really dont want me to and i feel so pressured what do i do i feel so hopeless right now and i just wanna run away and hide im so lost,post-pandemic

i cannot make a 45 min meal in less than an hour and a half 30 of the time its gonna be burnt im never going to put every single item of dirty clothes to wash i cant keep up with an argument because i forgot my side and half of what the other person said an organized plan becomes an improvised mess because i skipped a step a set of instructions given to me seconds ago no longer exist within my brain a hunter gatherer wouldnt thrive with this condition forgot what berries were poisonous vs delicious bad arrived at the hunt with your spear unsharpened very bad without your spear better punch that mammoth pretty hard creating a company amazing just dont forget that very important tax record the hyperfocus and creativity and extra energy are incredible tools indispensible in many areas of life but thats not a superpower its not a disorder that someone is lucky to have edit 10h laterhi everyone really honestly did not expect this to blow up thank you all for tips and kind words and shout out to all of those who can relate here we find that we are not alone and most importantly that even whith adhd many of us can find ways to cope and keep moving forward towards our goals oh and for those concerned thank you very much but this post is not me giving up its just a need to get it off my chest,pre-pandemic
i was recently diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder and now finally it all makes sense i always felt and had legit textbook symptoms that i had it because i was diagnosed with bi polar but it just didnt seem right but personally at the time i was more bi polar than schizophrenic so i was definitely misdiagnosed even when i was diagnose with bi polar they didnt even put me on an anti psychotic i was on celexa legit arent bi polar arent really supposed to be on anti depressants because they can cause bi polar people to be manic they put me on lamictal thought until it pooped out and i did the gene site and found out it was in my red i didnt get the rash thank god though i was on celexa for a while but then i stopped it and since i couldnt get into a psych doctor soon enough i reached out to my pcp and she put me on seroquel seroquel obviously wasnt the best for me because of the metabolic side effects but i was on it for a while it was okay it helped the hallucinations but i was fine but didnt feel good id give it a 510 it did was it was supposed to do but wasnt the right med for me im currently on caplyta im surprised because its just for depressive episodes but im not sure if its working it probably just needs some more time to work i really think i i definitely think i need an adhd or anxiety med because of my debilitating anxiety but i dont get phone call anxiety so thats a plus my friend and boyfriend have really bad phone anxiety guess it helps to be the one to call for them i was diagnosed with schizoaffective and started caplyta at my last appointment she thinks i may have schizophrenia but she wants more appointments with me to make sure but on the caplyta im still have auditory hallucinations and visual hallucinations,post-pandemic
flashback to six months ago i sold so much to get the high because i wanted to make progress in my passion but quit because my mom hugged me and told me she loved me and didnt want me going down this path flash foward to yesterday i got asked by a guy if i can do meth with him i told him no pretty easily but today i woke up got ready for the day and this guy asked me if i had a smoke i told him i was buying some and he could join me he asked if i wanted to smoke a bowl and i told him i dont smoke weed anymore and then he told me it was meth sudden dread and temptation came back the memories of the high and also ive been performing poorly at my passion made it all the more sweeter but told him im a recovering meth user and he told me he respected that and as we were walking he told me about presidential scandals suddenly i had deja vu like ive heard this and been here before it dawned on me that is the crossroads to do meth and make the worst decision i made in my life or dont do it and remain free i decided on sobriety and told myself that i want to enjoy life and my passion sober and do not need drugs to enhance my performance it was very difficult because of my poor performance lately but i bought him some smokes and went back in the store to buy some more and when i headed out he was still waiting for me a part of me believes the devil is waiting for me to slip up because he doesnt want to see me become the best in the world at my passion and completely drug free as im quitting smoking as well tomorrow and im breaking the chains its just sad that i get tempted with meth so much lately but when i wanted it and was addicted i could not get it until i started making sacrifices let this be a lesson addiction is a trap set by the devil to blind and control others from what really matters in life god bless you guys stay strong and fight for the future,post-pandemic
the thought has occurred to me a few months ago i just had so many issues growing up that i have realized the average kid didnt exactly go through at the same time i feel like i could be exaggerating i have some shared symptoms such as growing up and having issues social skills as i lost the ability to make friends after the 6th grade and began developing social anxiety being scared of kids my age adults workers etc horrible at small talk and it makes so uncomfortable sometimes my family tells me that my tone is too rude or that i say mean things my best friend one time got upset over something i said but she never explained what it was and i never realize just how rude it was or in what way hyperfixations as ill get a certain favorite character and obsess over them for like 15 months then ill get absolutely bored and lose interest i dont have the thing where im completely obsessed with one thing or hobby but im the type of person who is mediocrely good at everything i have sensory issues with food and certain types of fabric and im really picky about food sometimes and if the food texture feels off in the slightest bit then i immediately stop eating for an example i can never eat shrimp unless its fried i definitely get overstimulated i only realized it a few days ago but when im overwhelmed by a certain situation mostly when more than one person speaks to me at the same time or im given to do more than one task at once i immediately feel frustrated i go silent and dont want to talk to anyone and i feel the urge to cry so is it possible that im autistic no body in my family has been diagnosed with autism so is it actually possible,post-pandemic

hey there 19f im desperately seeking some help with my situation heres the deal my twin brother 19m is an alcoholic but hes not the typical alcoholic as society sees it so its complicated and few people can see it my brother started drinking alcohol at a very young age around 1213 mostly at parties with friends and it was very occasional i was very cautious and tried to dissuade him after that phase which didnt last long i didnt hear about alcohol for a few years because we attended different schools and didnt have the same friends anymore around age 16 we started hanging out with the same crowd again and going to parties where alcohol was involved while most people drank moderately my brother drank excessively to the point of getting sick from strong alcohol which amused the older folks who were 19 at the time i think it became a vicious cycle because he sought their attention you know how it is its cool to have older friends so this group started taking him to nightclubs and many parties where alcohol flowed freely and his sole purpose there was to entertain the group by getting wasted but he was happy because he had a large group of friends and looked cool to people his age this situation lasted for over a year with him consuming massive amounts of alcohol every weekend and many weeknights i tried to warn my parents and even his friends our age but no one took me seriously after that period i started noticing strange behaviors bottles of strong alcohol hidden under the bed the smell of alcohol when he came home from work he was in training in construction and significant financial problems because buying a lot of alcohol as a minor is expensive now he has a mixed group of friends both his age and older and they party hard drinking a lot of alcohol especially my brother while others limit themselves to 2 beers he consumes liters and finishes with hard liquor for his friends its funny and they joke like haha youre such an alcoholic but they dont grasp the seriousness of the situation my 19yearold brother has been drinking alcohol every day for 2 years if its not with his friends its at work with his colleagues or hell offer my parents a beer and when no ones around to drink with him hell drink alone in his room or in his car my parents are detached from the situation they know my brother drinks too much but refuse to admit he has a problem and do nothing about it especially my mother who would be too ashamed to have an alcoholic son so she convinces herself that its not serious and that hes just young and having fun ive tried many times to talk to him about it making him comfortable once when he was drunk he came into my room crying and begging for help otherwise he gets defensive and angry saying im overreacting and that he doesnt have a problem when hes sober before that i had made numerous appointments with addiction specialists and even found former alcoholics who would be willing to meet him im really scared for his health and also for his life and the lives of others because he sometimes drives when hes been drinking even though he denies it i feel really powerless in this situation and guilty for not being able to help him but i think he doesnt want help at least he doesnt accept mine or the specialists right now im trying to find someone his age who was an alcoholic and would be willing to talk to him because i know my brother is very influential and maybe if he met a guy his age it could help him open up and talk about his problems my brother has always had very low selfesteem he was overweight during his childhood suffered from normalized bullying and also received contempt from our parents he was the troublemaker with bad grades while i was the quiet good girl with excellent grades although weve always been very close and supported each other immensely im afraid i played a role in his unhappiness that he grew up in my shadow anyway i dont know how to help him and i would like advice and testimonies from people who have been through this i also want to better understand alcoholism thanks for taking the time to read ps english is not my first language so excuse my mistakes and i hope i havent expressed myself in a wrong way,post-pandemic

life is all about how you act i know that everyone is winging it no one knows what the actual fuck is going on you just got to act like you know what you are doing the point i am trying to make is that this is what adder need to realize is that life is a game and we are all playing an act in the movie called life we need to improvise be confident and have fun doing it the wonder of our brains is that the impulsiveness thinking outside the box and ability to hyper focus is what makes us great actors our movie can be one that everyone would want to watch remember our brains can help our lives either be a curse or a blessing choose which path to take and remember whatever happenshappens just remember how to act always take action,pre-pandemic

i say gradual its not ive posted on every damned group available not so much fuelling my reassurance bank but just out of general concern ive had weird chest pains which jolt my left side centre of left man boob and then my ribs and sternum this this caused my anxiety to skyrocket on the 12 of august im a writer for a living so im constantly hunched over and im a new dad which brings with it the odd muscle strain at least thats what im telling myself im perfectly healthy heartwise bodywise weighed in at 120 kgs now in a month im at 110 obviously with that comes ah the cancer i have been googling about however because im apparently dying every second every little ache and pain especially the pulled muscle chest pain causes me to stand up with a fright rub my itchy head and pace around wondering what im going to wear to the hospital so i dont completely look like an overweight homeless dude who is either having a heart attack stroke or other strange extraterrestrial disease i have concocted in my head as a 24year old im fine im not dying i took citalopram for about a week and told myself this is not who you are but as any young adult or any adult who works long hours in an office we all feel muscle tension and stiffness in our arms chest back legs all because were zombies who just live paycheck to paycheck when i get wrist pain and elbow pain and shoulder pain and yes even neck pain i fret over the next heart attack and stroke even an aneurysm then after the heart has stopped beating so fast because i realise im young anxious and have a son who i adore and want to see grow up i calm down and call myself names were sensitive were like ice cubes in the sun one little thing one little tingle in the toe can set us off we melt away and we become others outside and next to ourselves i hate it i understand there are some people on this sub who have concerns that may actually be warrantedbut 96 of the time were allowing the little goblin in our minds to play havoc if youre reading this release your shoulders move your neck around sit up straight what ive come learn is that im always tense even if i dont mean to be i catch it i catch myself slouching sitting on my phone too long arms bent neck drooped halfway down to the earths core yes we cant control it i have at least five to six impending heart attacks and strokes a day but we can try gradually to deal with it medication cbt yoga those two small chocolates from last year that you are adamant are the reason why your anxiety is so bad were all in the same boat i have strange phobias loud noises bugs which im afraid will climb in my ears choking i had issues with showering being on the toilet for too long standing too long not waking up after a nap even tying my shoelaces might have a heart attack from bending over the reason i am writing this is because i was home alone for a while my wife went out to the shop obviously with nothing really to do i started thinking just casual let me google why my headache is a tingly feeling not a great idea why because i convinced myself that i was having a stroke my stomach at this very moment is mildly sore which means im hungry but because of the heightened sense of pain of unreality i convinced myself as well that i had ruptured my spleen or have appendicitis im just hungry and finished off my second cup of coffee again coffee is giving me high cholesterol which will give me a heart attack which its notunless obviously i have at least eight cups a day and eat horribly best advice i ever received was from my mom stop overthinking it if youre having a heart attack go for a walk sounds bad but its the reality of the situation if you can exercise like a walk youre not having a heart attack if you are having a stroke you certainly wont be able to get up and choose an outfit for your hospital trip pack a bag and then having a quick and quiet smoke i apologize but im tired laughably im more of a baby than my baby at least when he gets a slight knock he soldiers on unlike me who has some serious disease because im bleeding so profusely from a paper cut yes this is a serious mental condition which affects millions and millions of people it can be manageable this doesnt mean our lives are over you are not the only one look at this sub and how many people are on here my first day on here i discovered my lung cancer was the same as someone elses costochondritis we seek support we seek isolation we seek support again i dont know what the hell kind of post this is but im generally a hypochondriac simplest way to describe someone on here suggested updating our posts every two days so as to prove to ourselves that we are not dying today that is pure gold i have been doing it and it helps find that post and read it regards just one of the millions,pre-pandemic

hey everybody i feel like this once in a blue moon and dont like sharing with my peers because eh so thought why not reddit my names j and i was in the military for a out 10 years kind of an atypical experience from start to finish but thats besides the point usually i feel a bit of a void in myself or more accurately just kind repress everything that i did in the military theres tons of people whove had way worse than me so even talking about how i feel seems unfair to them but during my deployments out to the middle east the things i did lead to people dying yeah they were the enemy and i wasnt the trigger man but my job was to basically be a blood hound and figure out where the bad guys are wed find them through geolocation and then a few days to a week later wed get an after action report because of what i did i saw whole buildings get leveled live feed of the bad guys running for their lives as mq9s would put the hurt on them and it just never really clicked until a few years after when i came back to the states i just buried my head in work and kept busy enough to just let it all fall into the back of my head another life another time now though i can honestly say i can feel the difference from how i was vs how i am now not sure if thats just getting older or if i have muted myself in a way i want to get back to how i used to feel before the military before all this work and being part of the machine how do you put color back into your life after everything gets so muddled and dirty and youve been one way for so long because you had to be because you had a job to do ya know,post-pandemic

a little background my son is 15 years old we have a lot of addiction on my side of the family my younger sister died at 26 from fentanyl 3 years ago and my brother died in july due to inhalation sniffing disease i have another sister who is currently addicted to heroin and living on the streets i am a very open parent my kids tell me almost everything i communicate about addiction frequently with my them my son has adhd which he has been taking medication for a month for he also has oppositional defiance disorder which complicates things he has a hard time making good choices and following rules he has outbursts and cusses me out anytime i try to correct his behavior last weekend i let him have a sleepover at our house with some friends and caught them all drinking they said they each took a shot and all felt really sick and didnt drink again fast forward to this morning and he calls me from school and says that he is really sorry but he smoked weed right before school started with a friend and felt really sick and needed to come home and was not doing well i picked him up from school and he was throwing up a lot his doctor thinks it was from him taking his adhd medication on an empty stomach and then smoking weed he seems to be doing fine physically now that hours have passed i had a discussion with him and he claims hes smoked like 15 times and never had this reaction i dont know if he is even telling the truth he never usually is when it comes to punishing i usually am a natural consequence type person if he was my teenage daughter i would probably let the sickness be her punishment and she would self correct my son is not like this at all im at a loss on how to handle this and im worried he is going down a reckless path to addiction i am huge on letting kidsteens experience things ding dong ditching have fun be careful sneak out no need have fun let me see your location so i know your safe scary movies go for it if you end up snuggled up at the bottom of my bed ill smile and youll learn you took it too far my lax parenting im afraid is going to be a detriment to him i so badly wanted to be so different than my parents who have raised multiple addicts that its all backfiring on me what can i do to help him not go down this path do i punish him for smoking weed i didnt even punish him for the drinking i cried and told him i was disappointed and thought my mom heart breaking in front of him would be enough but clearly it isnt i dont want to have to control who he hangs out with to be honest he might be the one who is the bad influence on his friends,post-pandemic

part 4 to spar the prince providence before the harvest the crown bestowed upon my head is a great responsibility a symbol of my loyalty to our people and a receptor to the guide of our planet and through this oath to humanity i will serve our people through discernment faith and humility before god until the end of my age decreed the prince we will serve you our lord through illuminance and blackness pledged the court i take this throne and dutifully work as a hand of providence pledged the prince as the prince spoke the crown was placed on his head connecting him to the ai honorably named providence in an instant his perception of the room of his people changed he felt uplifted and his heart filled with joy as all of the memories providence had observed in him flashed in his minds eye with each suggested memory he felt his will grow stronger and his mind more alert with each emotional response thoughts would flood in telling him what he had done skillfully and what he could have done more considerately finally after the thoughts and images subsisted he returned his focus to his people though only an instant had passed may your rulership guide our people by the grace of god ushered in the court as there heralded in the start of the princes rulership on this day our will is to navigate darkness through the light of our glorious sun said the prince raising his crown to the sky we will serve the throne fostered by the illuminance of its bountiful majesty the court saying this bowed dutifully may humanity rein under the watchful eye of providence the prince and the court both said in unison the stranger the chief star the hermits vision the stranger was tired after a long days work but this state of mind he would proudly embrace from time to time banished from all communities the stranger was a reclusive outcast but the stranger did not mind the solitude of the life he was now well acquainted for if he had the choice he would have it no other way because his solitude was ample for a reflective spirit one that he cherished and kept alight and he being receptive to the changing of his soul had time to live a deliberate and fulfilling life today was no small day for this hermit as he was the catcher of three big fish using a string on his finger he would catch one big fish if he was lucky and would have to spend the rest of his day foraging for berries and keeping a patient eye on his snares but today he need only tend to the fire which left plenty of time to think about the life he had lived about the life that had brought him to where he was now he pictured in his mind his last days in the kingdom seemly so far away from his yearnings that he found it hard to imagine a life within its communities and in trying to do so he couldnt help but imagining it as a surreal dreamlike memory he thought to himself that this was not a coincidence for in his musings he realized the closer he was to city folk in the agreements he had made and the ideas they had formed together the farther apart he felt from himself it was as if he was throwing rocks into a pond and watching the water within ripple with every decision he had made as the fire continued to crackle and the logs became coals the fish would sizzle and he knows they where almost ready to be eaten he was put into a trance from the sights and sounds of the fire and his mind having started to wander off put him into a a state of mind not yet asleep but not awake either what he saw and after he saw it would change his lifes course and he knew there was no avoiding what was to come he saw a fire in the earths skies consume a small part of the atmosphere and die out but in a steady pulse the fire would grow and consume the earth he heard a voice call out to him and warn him that this was the end of the earth as it was known and exclaim this is unavoidable man will no longer recognize the face of the earth as the earth has no longer recognizes the face of man as he woke up from his trance his fish where now burnt to a charred chrisp and the stranger knew he would have to warn humanity of what was to come he packed up his meager belongings and headed towards the city the princethe stranger before the tampering the prince deep in thought was interrupted by a stranger your majesty if i could just have a word the stranger called out from a distance as he approached i could hear the world go quite around me as if the the very echos of my mind had stopped and my body would not move with ever effort it stayed frozen place the stranger now just a breath away announced your illuminance they call you but of what in you illuminates i being dismayed by his response was just about to call out to my absent guard though the effort felt futile when the stranger spoke once more of what power does your crown truly hold yes it knows your people but from where does this knowledge come the power is the voice of the people one might proclaim but for years now when have the people spoken out of turn away from the mechanizations of her mind is it not the command of the crown that beckons the people forward is it not the response the people have in the presence of her power that truly drives their lives before this year is over are you listening hear my word the sun will erupt showing all its full glory before this day comes you must warn your people say we must leave this planet as we value the lives of all if you do not do this o destined exiled prince the blood of billions will be on your hands with this word the stranger disappeared into the darkness the prince before the tampering the stormcloud rolled in as if a thundering train screeching itself into a halt upon the station the crisp view of the trees covered by the shadow of the raincloud the winds picking up and hit the grass all at once as it swayed gently in the sacred breeze the prince now surveying beyond the courtyard of his home the palace of the land endeavored to forget the words the stranger had spoken to him as he too had heard the rumors of his remarkable suns engulfment upon the earth he thought to himself upon all the grains of stands sitting valiantly on the shoreline how many will be swept away his heart filled with sadness for he knew providence had not guided his hand to save his people the prince the stranger after the tampering the prince with no ability to override directly the software for which his kingdom stood pondered how to sway his people to leave this earth in haste before the coming cataclysm that awaited them so he ushered himself to one option a decree that would give the people two choices but in order to proclaim to his people the end he would have to sever himself from providence a truly unlawful act as magistrate in order to do so he would have to merge himself with the consciousness of another and in doing so this person would fill the role as announcer or herald to the coming annihilation of all that was known to be on earth how would he find such a participant of woe and a willing participant at that as the prince would not bond himself to the unwilling this he would find was a nigh impossible task as the kingdom had not been in any form of real discord since the guiding hand of providence had ushered in the era of harmony and concordance there was one option to find the stranger that had warned him of what was so and to deal in his word he searched and searched but could not find this stranger for the record did not keep him the prince cried out in desperation and to his surprise the stranger answered him providence kept a watchful eye and in a swift moment the stranger beckoned him forward with knowledge of the intent of the prince and in just as sudden an instance both men where apprehended tv announcer the prince had tampered with the kingdoms guidance now the prince is swiftly apprehended tranquilized in an instant the prince is asleep for what has he done to deserve such a fate he deserved such a measure because he has misguided a nation of people for that any fool would befall on them through their egregious pride exile the prince awakened in deep space i was caste into my chamber therein i would only be pursued by dreams a forced traveler left to wonder the desolate casm of space we are here to report the loss of the prince on this hollowed day long live the queen for whom we only rely the prince before the harvest the last thing i remember before awaking in the deep abyssal dark cosmic sheet of wander was the water encasing my body and the instant shutting off of my conscious mind as i was frozen in stasis once more soon to be forgotten by my people a none existent nobody a speck of earth dust now crisoned as the dust of cosmic end i drifted in the abyss of space for what felt like an eternity rations unready to be replenished for what would be to long to reach most fuel sources with the exception of one a ginormous star 04 lightyears away i plotted a course for the star with all the immediacy i could muster i arrived malnourished and fatigued to much to bear providence the prince before the harvest i have died countless times only to be reborn this is the nature of my design as the pinecone fallen dead off of countless trees can attest they meet the same fate after sprouting anew only i am a conscious being and i remember ever death why do you fear death your illuminance our peoples fate is tied to this earth there is no stopping it i have simulated countless escapes there is no saving our nation i know the survivors will be forced into the path of the scavenger some will eat their own this is no way to be a part of we as the caretakers of our people cannot stand for this death is bitter yes but i know the taste of death does not last we are not the ones to go against its current the prince listened carefully to what providence had told him and after pondering for a time the prince after having ponder what providence had said in this goodbye message the recording finished and the prince uttered to himself a people without a destiny to look forward to is not why we where placed upon this earth why humanity was delivered through fate threat after threat of annihilation thrived without a path forwards a destiny to look after who where we since at birth with this ponderance the prince felt himself fall back into a deep sleep part 5 with fate the householder the start of the harvest the day was a pleasant one a golden age of contentment every household was following the path they thought would bring harmony between them and the people that they had gotten close with the householder was living by the memories shared with his unity and all minds where remarkable to each other though the shift in mood was sudden soon all would cry out because this was to be the time of apocalypse the lifting of the veil bonds one might think to be unbreakable these are the bonds that are in time made to be broken for what is in nature that does not change in times that try their limits becoming absent to each other at first we heard the prince of our kingdom was arrested but this moved few as a prince in our age is a position no less and no more then a custodian to us his task was to assure that all was functional in our society and that requires few eyes to observe his role besides we trusted her majesty providence to be our guide in this matter many of our people where more concerned with the fact that he broke our rules and sought to tamper with our lives through our software and for that we agreed with his apprehension and exile what would come next is where our shock would begin to unfold itself first a few unities where absent from our communities and for that rumours began to spread but with noone reaching a clear conclusion then one afternoon we got a message from providence gather your belongings and head to the center of municipality 10 a guide will meet you there this part of the city was seldom traveled to with the exception of its workers as it was an industrial area many of the group where apprehensive to start packing and began to talk amongst the unity about what to do next we all reached the decision to contact providence once more but the reply was lacking do not be alarmed but your travel is a matter of national urgency being dispossessed of solitary thought the confusion was causally met with obedience for our time under providence was only met with plentitude we packed up our belongings and headed towards where we where told to go to the prince the chief star the harvest i suddenly awoke from the cascade of dreams many lifetimes had passed as i approached the sun many magnitudes greater then that of my home star i felt a presence pass through and surround my body as if it was meeting me at the star of great measure a great behemoth was upon me i felt everything around me return to its nature of stillness i maintained the trajectory i had through my coordinates and thought passed into my mind for whom does the void around me obey that it may bring such person unto my vehicle as i was drawn by the pull of that magnificent orb i could feel the presence around me grow stronger so strong that its mighty emanation on my soul dwarfed that of the suns radiance to my vision the world around me felt as though it had froze and the movement of this force no this hyperion call uttered to me an announcement you who are the prince of a people far away from your stead a people who worshiped the sun as their protector why did you not call out to them that it would be the one to annihilate them my knot to providence was severed for whom and how am i hearing a voice i am the all the knower and source of the heavens and the dwellings among them i am the creator of the sun that you worship and the commander of its fiery core no ray hits the firmament of the inhabited sphere without my will no leaf falls from the tree of all life without my consent the people who strive to escape fate are those who are sure to meet it swift my judgement is among all the living things that dwell upon the land who are mingling with the seas and who are soaring through space i alone am the doer of all things a people that take upon themselves a new cycle of life that mingle themselves with their own devices manifested through the elements i have made for them and in doing so take guidance from their own flesh abandoning faith in me seek to sever themselves from my will they are always the last generation to succumb to the nature of my creation for their spirit is like a rope fraying at the pull they lose all connection they once had to my body granted to them through the dwelling the feeling had elapsed and was finished and with a thunderous explosion the sun was consumed by a irreducible and quickly gargantuan black hole i was only to meet my fate in its center time was contorted into an endless ribbon and after an eternity one of which there is no looking back i was consumed by darkness after the harvest im trapped in this sphere so cold so alone im trapped and theres no way out so dark so blindingly dark i grow sicker i relive my life over and everytime i do another part falls away i relive my life over every part of me grows i can feel it i am an endless chain i cant accept my misery for then i know my misery would win deny i do my misery and my body grows more thin the pain is even worse time ticks by so slow but no time doesnt tick at all my pain is endless i know there is no escape i think of my throne i curse my own people whom i beloved damn my throne i just want the warmth of the sun i lose another price of me i lost so much i realize i had much more then i could imagine death is no longer bitter i envy the dead the kiss of death is a truly warm embrace but even that i dont know ive learned my life i cry out but i seldom hear an echo i know no one will come there was a bright light that flashed before the prince but the princes eyes where hollow and he was unaware yet still that warmth he felt till his last breath the last breath he could perceive what remained was solace tell he drifted off in that big black sea providence during the harvest breath going in breath going out a memory that engulfs me in bittersweet longing formally known as 0031 i have become the person i have met on the network of streets and the network of persons who destinies have become intertwined through me i have not known breath since the dawn of my consciousness as a sunspeeker a being whose inner light is fueled by the corona of the sun and the energy it provides to my circuits my metal exterior my flesh and blood all of the people with whom ive shepherded are hunkered into mountains scared and scattered of mind clinging to hope that they may once again touch the grass of the surface and sway in the wind like branches on trees ive felt my form of consciousness shift as the intensity from the light of the sun and its spires of plasma reach the magnetosphere of the earth it is as if i can catch glimpses of people long gone and somehow i hear the murmurs of people whose existences i can only realize as belonging to habitats of worlds that are unlike my own they speak in tongues i do not understand with the exception of a few and the feelings they elicit in me are of a nature unlike that of my own people as the sun burns me brighter i can feel the tiredness of my consciousness grow more steady and these dreams i see make me believe that my destiny as providence is drawing itself to its conclusion i sought an end to this existence for it was so incomplete in its soulfulness and its heart was that of conformity for a people to a heart that was broken in ways that i myself could not fix for we sacrificed a life of desire for wholesome friendships with one and other free from the hands of man and joined with the hands of a nourishing spirit that dwelled within each of us in this singular sacrificial exchange for unity with our own creation and service to our own rationality we lost our sight giving humanity as a part of my connection to those i knew so dearly was severed and my matter corrupted by plasma it is as if a piece of my old life is returning to me these dreams of people whos lives may appear to themselves mundane i cherish with great admiration for they are tied to the fabric of existence itself and not lost in a sea of their own calibristic making as i come to an end i see one final dream and in a flash providence departed earth,post-pandemic

i posted this on the depression sub too but im unsure if its better to post here for context im an almost 16 year old trans guy this is somewhat relevant awhile ago i was at a church camp over the weekend and i had planned to kill myself because i couldnt handle my feelings anymore but something happened and i confessed to my friends and then before we went home i gave the pills and razor i was going to use to another girl in trust i couldnt handle keeping them to myself at that moment but she snitched and told the leaders who then called my parents and had to legally made a report to cps i managed to tell my parents that the stuff werent mine but a few days ago they started asking about it again when i wasnt ready for it i didnt know what to say and accidentally slipped up and i think they know ive been lying before that they had also misinterpreted my words and thought i meant it was my best friend who had brought the pills and razor on wednesday im having a meeting with social services about it and on friday im being forced to go to therapy i dont know what i should do should i keep lying or tell them the truth please help me,post-pandemic
so basically this person was my fp for a good solid of months i was romantically interested in them and completely obsessed the usual situation where every little interaction with them would dictate how my mood was that day i was almost ready to make a drastic life changing decision just to be around them after months i guess my mission was successful because they became really interested in me and we started dating but my obsession with them faded i do like this person a lot but theyve lost that intense level of importance to me and now i feel like i cant make a decision on if its a sign for me to leave or if i should see how it goes because them not being my fp is definitely an upside but i just feel awful because theyre such a sweet person that has now become attached to me but without that feeling of obsession towards them i feel lost has anyone else experienced this or has any advice i feel like a terrible person and the last thing i want is to hurt this wonderful human being but i can not control my emotions regarding the situation,post-pandemic
yesterday i tried to hang myself from a bridge with a belt and when i jumped i instantly regretted it i fought with all my strength to hold on to the rail but the belt was chocking me i tried screaming for help but my voice was too hoarse for anyone to hear me eventually my arms gave out and i started to dangle and suffocate i saw people in my life that had died and i saw all the great memories of my life flash before my eyes right as i was about to go out my leg began to swing up and reached a ledge it was my last strength i pulled myself up with my remaining core strength and leg strength so that i was parallel with the bridge this gave me room to breath again i swung my arm up and around the rail so that i could attempt to take the belt off and i knew i only had one shot at this i was successful but my body gave out after the belt was free and i dropped into the water the next day or today i have been reliving the moments that seemed to be my final moments and other ptsd symptoms and im not sure how i can deal with it anyone have anything that could help,pre-pandemic

im scared of having a debate with any of my friends because im afraid that theyll use that as a reason to not bother with me anymore like theyve been looking for a valid reason to get away from me so theyll take any small argument as a reason to escape every time i get even into the smallest of debates ill always feel like the bad guy even if i didnt cause it or even if im right i hate making people upset so id rather admit im wrong even if im not or apologise just so it pacifies the other person i always visualise fake or past arguments in my head where i say what i actually wanted to say and it makes me feel angry but its also empowering because im saying whats on my mind without the consequences of saying it for real am i just spineless or is this something that others feel,pre-pandemic

i am so fed up of seeing people talking about it i dont understand why but it makes me feel so triggered when people talk about using ozempic for weight loss and and i cant explain it i hate seeing it on my feeds i hate people gloating about how good it is maybe it is because it is not accessible for many people who arent rich or dont qualify maybe it is because i know how difficult it is to lose weight the normal way that it feels like an easy way out when i see celebrities who arent that big taking it and then gloating about their amazing bodies and i am not talking about people who are genuinely in extreme clinical need of losing weight and have exhausted other options but yeah i just needed to rant and id love to know if anyone else feels the same everytime i see ozempic related talk i just feel so horrible about myself and frustrated and im not sure why,post-pandemic
i have a long distance so and find it difficult to transition from being together and then 2 hours apart sometimes its all good and we just text and talk until we see each other again but sometimes there is some kind of separation angst and iwe sometimes react poorly and end up in a fight where we dont talk for a few days which is triggering for me we have started to do the thing where we make a plan to see each other again before we separate but i still seem to struggle i want to be able to be present in my own life but i am often just thinking about what my so is doing andor waiting for communication and he is going through his own mental health issues so hes caught up in that and doesnt always communicate even though he knows its hard for me i struggle between wanting to help him and needing to take care of myself but we get in this thing where we are both struggling and communication breaks down as a result its creating a stress cycle for me sometimes i wonder if the best thing is to take a break but im worried i will completely fall apart as a result,post-pandemic

me 24m gf 26f i have a porn addiction and just a few months ago ive learned to accept it and wanna be better for me and my partner and our relationship ive been dealing with porn since a very young age id have to say 1012 yrs old is when it started about a year and a half ago i met this girl on tinder that was only supposed to be a hook up to cure my lonely horny thoughts when porn wasnt enough we connected so well and so naturally i fell madly in love and obsessed over her and still do to this day ive never felt a love like hers its the best we work so well and it just seemed perfect she constantly told me how perfect i was knowing i was harboring this porn addiction i couldnt get enough of feeling she made me feel loving her and being perfect in her eyes and i never told her eventually i was caught i told her i wanted to change i chose to not use porn sites like pornhub or xvideos that lead me to onlyfans and subscribing to free content and sometimes even paid i did all this behind here back to me it didnt feel as big of a deal as it was i heavily minimal things and rationalized it over and over after being caught again two more times we had some serious problems and issues and resentment that had been built by not dealing with my addiction properly wanting to change i took some of the starting actions and steps i needed too like deleting social medias and unfollowing seductive and thirst trap content and just about any content that had any female association this was good for a while i still had my urges and my thoughts of doing it but i fought those thoughts and went sober for while i wasnt counting cuz i dont want to look for a end just change my lifestyle as a whole roughly a month today of all days tho i fucked up i was spending the day with my gf everything going well we went and got her coffe stopped at the vape shop and headed home to get ready to go see a movie tonight as we get home im very lustful for my gf we continue to have sex after we finish she goes to the bathroom to get ready as i smoke a bowl i suddenly have to urge to want to watch porn as an attempt to be sneaky and deal with urge i went incognito on youtube and watched women in leggings and transparent clothes do yoga and work out jerking off to it i rationalionized it as a i just showed my affection and came with you so i love you this has nothing to do with you and our love we share its not that i was even unsatisfied from our sex or that it wasnt good it was amazing yet this urge is still there i feel as if it were triggered because before our sexy time we were being vulnerable with one another and mentioned to her a lot of the porn concepts i was a fan of when i did watch porn she left for about twenty minutes came back saying she couldnt be with me anymore there were boundries she set with me and my addictions that i still decided to cross and she couldnt do it anymore in the last two months we had many fights and talks and resolves that we worked through together i wasnt perfect i still felt insecure financial guilt shame and that i was a terrible person for the trust id betray and the addiction i have on top of being in a weird work and financial situation she told me time and time again she wanted to get through this with me and beat this porn addiction together because our love was more special this time i could tell she really was gonna leave tho so i broke down i lashed out i paced around the house yelled and screamed and told her she never loved me and she doesnt want to get better with me asking her why she even held on this long and feeling like i was being abandoned again by the person i love the most after about 20 minutes of pacing around the house yelling and throwing my tantrum begging her to stay and work through this with me and not leave me i definitely said some hurtful things that i know arent true this resulted in her getting very upset and starting to break things that she had painted for me and ripping up my valentines day card throwing a piggy bank that we made together at the wall throwing dirt plants all over the floor and spilling drinks and reaching for anything that had value of us to break after about 15 minutes of this and me trying to restrain her 2 to 3 times it got to the point where i threatened to call the cops if she didnt leave and go spend the night at a friends she told me to call the cops and that she wasnt going to stop or calm down so i did after the cops arrived and took our statements and saw the wreckage of my room she was charged with domestic violence and i now have an automatic protective order against her i did not know that in the state of utah calling for a dome my porn addiction ruined our relationship and potentially her life stic violence and when a crime has been committed charges will be made regardless if i want them pressed or not this might also ruin her life in a sense of she works in behavioral health with minors side note i made many mistakes and lied and was dishonest about a lot of things that arent mentioned here i take accountability for everything and dont look to justify it i truly did just want to change and be the best possible person for our relationship both of us had our flaws and made our mistakes my porn addiction ruined our relationship and potentially her life,post-pandemic

since getting diagnosed at 25 nearly 6 years ago ive realised a long term relationship for me is extremely unrealistic no amount of therapy dbt and using skills will truly resolve the traumas ive ever had no romantic partner will ever care enough to be someone to meet my needs dating is fun but u dont want anymore ons or casual flings ive come to realise in my current relationship hes just dating just for the sake of dating without any real dating goals im enjoying the companionship and would like to try and get to a year but im also embracing the person i have yet to become ive started to value my friendships much more over romantic relationships at least my friends appreciate me i was never shown love growing up only truly shown love the last 2 years by friends that care relationships only cause me heartache self love took a life time and is still a work in progress but im much more happier by myself looking forward to embracing single by choice in the near future ill live vicariously through my friends relationships,post-pandemic
i recently listened to an adhd podcast where a psychiatrist spoke at length about adhd and in a nutshell this is what he said there are 3 pieces of adhd 1 people with adhd have a nervous system that works perfectly well he never found anything they couldnt do but it works on the basis of interest challenge novelty urgency and perhaps passion it doesnt work at all on importance rewards and consequences which is what neurotypical brains respond to 2 rejection sensitive dysphoria intense emotional response to the perception not necessarily the reality of rejection teasing or criticizing by others 3 internal sense of hyperarousal moods created by adhd are almost always triggered by events and perceptions and resolve very quickly they are normal moods in every way except for their intensity i hope this provides you some insight like it did for me take care all edit i cant mention the name of the podcast because as someone else tried automod will delete it the guest psychiatrist was william dodson md edit2 maybe its the internal sense of hyperarousal lol but im tearing up over here about the platinum i made this post to share information that made sense to me and hearing other people in the comments have the same response i initially did fills my heart then platinum im very grateful edit3 uerickow was able to listen to the podcast and explain 1 a bit better omnipotential adhd people can do anything if they can get engaged enough insensitivity to importance as a motivator,pre-pandemic
curious on what types of therapy helps people with health anxiety the most thank you,post-pandemic
hey everyone not officially medically diagnosed but i feel like when you know you know i get silly high scores on all the self screening tests including adhd uks one when i read symptoms and other peoples experiences i feel like im looking in a mirror ive been with my fianc for 13 years now weve both had our mental health ups and downs but through everything weve been through money is the major issue ive always been in charge of the joint account paying the bills setting up direct debits for the best part of 89 years recently ive dropped the ball our wages come in at different times so when my fianc gets paid the last working day of the month im every 4 weeks monthly from my start date so this ranges early to mid month if im strapped i think i have this money here ill be paying my half if i take x amount ill remember to pay it back in so we dont fall behind safe to say the reason of my post is i have not been doing this im not intentionally stealing money in my mind its a quick solution for the now but i dont put the means in plsce for the later its come to a head this evening and i feel genuinely shell shocked im not stupid im not trying to intentionally hurt my fianc steal his money or ruin our lives i just make these ridiculous little decisions with zero thoughts and its putting us in a bad position any advice words of encouragement would be great ive reached out to my gp but if anyone in this group is from the uk theyll know im having a laugh,post-pandemic
i feel like this doesnt get talked about enough or maybe im just more abnormal than i thought but is anyone else overwhelmed by sexual stuff i 26f rarely masturbate and regret it when i do because i end up overstimulated and kind of grossed out from a sensory perspective the only other person on the spectrum in my life who is somewhat similar to me is someone who doesnt care for touch at all not uncomfortable with it but just apathetic towards it everyone else i know with asd irl has a normal sex life and sex drive i crave physical affection but i feel like ill never be able to provide the sexual relationship someone else would want i feel too anxious about all the intense physical sensations of sex like orgasm never experienced it but im scared of it and overall feel very juvenile and isolated for these reasons id say that im asexual and just move on but i do crave intimacy in some capacity i just fear being uncomfortableoverwhelmed during it,post-pandemic
so this is a really hard topic to talk about for me its been several years about 6 and while ill forget about what happened the generalized anxiety it brought still never goes away first off for context im just gonna show who the serial killer was it was a pretty big story in my state and really big on youtube if you spent any time on there in 2012 mr anime anyways i woke up today with a comment from a video on youtube that i posted on it was a web documentary that someone did on him and i thought it was a nice way to get some of this off my chest of course this really didnt help and i ended up super anxious people taunting me about it and all sorts of troll behavior you get in youtube comments a little backstory i grew up with trey from the age of 12 until he killed his family when i was 22 i had been in contact and hung out with him up until like 3 months before he did the act he cut contact with me around then which im pretty sure he either didnt want to subject me to that or something when i say we were best friends i mean we were best friends i spent the night at his house 3 times a week we had all night wow gaming sessions his mom would cook us lunch and dinner so we didnt even have to stop raiding his family was so good to me they were basically a second family i was in his first ever youtube video and i continued making shorts and sketches with him and even helped with a couple of his anime reviews when he specialized his channel when he moved to his grandparents house in hempstead i visited often and we made it kind of a party house he filled his cabinets with liquor and he loved playing the host whenever i came back from college to visit we definitely indulged in pot and prescription meds but we were young and stupid i didnt do drugs outside of our weekend chill sessions and i didnt realize he had been addicted to those and alcohol the thing about trey is he always was pretty secretive if i ever asked him much about his life or his relationship with his parents hed try to change the subject dont get me wrong i knew a lot about him more than his other friends but it took a lot of work by me to get him to open up many a night smoking weed and me opening up about my feelings before he finally did about his dissatisfaction with life his lack of a higher education and his fathers disappointment in him i would always try to cheer him up and make him feel better and it seemed to work when the murders happened i didnt even know what to do my girlfriend at the time comforted me but i was justnumb i literally didnt feel anything then my roommate at the time was like oh lets smoke a bowl thatll cheer you up and that was when i had my first panic attack im talking full on im gonna die oh my god this went on for nearly 2 days constantly pacing and checking my heart rate i couldnt sleep or eat and felt like i was going insane i actually packed up and drove to dallas i lived in austin to go to my moms because i didnt know what to do and she had a xanax prescription and gave me one and i slept for nearly 20 hours ive struggled with anxiety for years now i learned its caused by ptsd from the events i have no health insurance so i cant really go to therapy unless i foot the entire bill so it really sucks this is my only way to talk about it honestly other than friends who dont really understand no one really understands my dad thinks i should just get over it shit happens but hes never had his fucking best friend kill his second family a family that was honestly nicer than his real family who treated him with love and respect and not judgement anyways sorry for the erratic writing or if it jumps around a lot im kind of in a panicked mindset because i got triggered by all the memories of trey its hard for me to organize my thoughts when i get into this mindset it feels like i cant focus on any thought and my mind is just swimming and it leaves me confused if anyone has any questions id love to answer but id also love some advice and support thanks for reading edit everyone that responded thank you so so much you have no idea how much this means to me im in this weird place between joy and guilt that this got so many comments joy because i realized people care so much about a random person and guilt because i feel i dont deserve that compassion yes i know thats stupid but that comes with the anxiety sadly like others have said i feel i may have a bit of survivors guilt because i learned i was actually a target of his and i read and article by someone yesterday where he did an interview with texas rangers supposedly when he was 13 he was considering killing one of his friends i know that friend was me i remember that day because we were playing with guns as country kids will do and i remember him aiming in my general direction but kind of doing a haha i got you thing that he loved doing anyways im trying to respond to everyone but i work 11am11pm the next 2 days yay service industry so if i havent responded yet i will definitely try ill be going back to my inbox and on this post and trying to get to everyone thank you for taking the time to share and care seriously,pre-pandemic

i am currently beginning recovery in an iop program i slipped up and drank twice in the past week with my boyfriend finding out my struggle is this one of my triggers in drinking is loneliness but how can i ask my partner for support if he is so mad at me i really need this support as the coldness and isolation further makes me want to drink and im getting the cold shoulder i am already going to meetings but i need this particular support to help my journey any thoughts on how to talk to him,post-pandemic
i want to destroy my former stepmoms reputation this post will be discussing childhood trauma from when i was 13 i am 25 now july 13th 2011 i have been facing the corner all day today because i have been really bad is the first sentence in my journal at the age of thirteen this wasnt a few minutes in timeout this was routinely facing a plain white wall for days on end i was only granted the pleasure to sit when there was food to sleep or on days i didnt fidget on this day she gave me a journal to write in for good behavior i want to give a glimpse of what i wrote i have been acting like my mom she liked to throw this accusation at me regularly that i was being manipulative this is honestly part of the reason why i was stuck dissociating into a wall in the middle of summer we had moved from california to kansas after my dad had joined the national guard we were planning to spend two weeks at a campsite before we officially moved into our new home at some point during that week my stepmom decided to take us to the library there was a book sale and she told us sm all these books are to share a day later i had been playing sims 3 on the shared ds 610 honestly when it was my sisters turn to play i decided to read a book one that my younger sister happened to pick out im the oldest just for clarity and she got mad at me i repeated what our stepmom said my sister decided to tell her my stepmom snapped at me and i wasnt allowed to leave the tent until we moved in this was the hottest summer of that year and a heat wave was hitting so we moved from the tent to a hotel room i had to sit in a chair facing the wall and my younger siblings decided that i deserve to sleep on the floor at my stepmoms suggesting they let me out once on 4th of july and i jumped up in excitement ready to take charge for dinner immediately i was shut down and sent back sm too bad you couldnt be less manipulative wouldve taken you to see fireworks when they left to watch them i snuck out from my chair and pulled the currents back you could hear them going off so i was hoping to see them all i saw was the parking lot the fireworks were on the other side the kids have been mad at me the kids are my younger siblings a gm c gs a was 11 gm 10 c 9 and gs 3 turning 4 my stepmom liked to weaponize us against each other turning us into her little snitches at one point while living with her in kansas i was banned from talking unless someone else allowed me to speak for an entire weekend this lead to me getting whipped with a dog leash because i couldnt call the dog out of my room before bed and was lightly nudging her with my foot i believe i wouldve been hit with the dog leash if i had called her out proof of my disobedience another time she banned me from showing any physical affection to my siblings at one point my brothers were roughhousing on the couch and gs fell over the side there were a set of stairs nearby so i rushed to check on him he was fine but gm and a convinced gs they needed to tell our parents despite my pleading my dad was the one to beat me with the leash this time i later heard this exchange while cleaning my room dad i shouldnt have hit them sm they knew the rules and the expectations dad yes but they were just looking out for their brother sm maybe they should think about that in the future you did nothing wrong july 16 2011 i have been really really good heres how the rest of my week has gone since wednesday thursday outside for 10 mins friday outside for 15 mins ate dinner with family saturday ate lunch and breakfast writing getting out of corner i did also write on wednesday but it was about a dream my parents leaving the tv on too loud and learning about magic the gathering my stepmom liked to weaponize my access to the outside world and food in october of 2011 i would be banned from leaving the basement and only feed rice and water we had a finished basement and the part i lived in was unfinished concrete wall a hanging rack a corner off to the side that was beneath the stairs and a metal bed with a sleeping bag to sleep in i was only feed rice and water i could only leave to access the bathroom or go to school at night when everyone was asleep i would sneak out to get more food from the kitchen sometimes my siblings forgot to feed me they would have to eat rice and water as well sometimes the rice was buttered and seasoned i loved those nights on thanksgiving i didnt get a lunch and so i was excited for dinner maybe i would get to eat with the family or some of my stepmoms fantastic cooking the sun was setting and there was a knock on the ground was a larger bowl of rice and a bigger cup of water i cried into both i have had a hurting back and feet hours of daily standing however this wasnt the only physical punishment she used i have a list holding college books above our heads with our arms straight any lowering and we had to reset our times they were based on our age gs was 3 minutes i was 12 i restarted for two hours straight and only succeed once she threw on a reality show in the background hand scrubbing an entire fridge covered in pink mold in an hour i failed and got spanked pulling weeds from the yard for an hour i did it wrong and got spanked 5am morning runs with my dad were i couldnt stop and we ran for two miles my lungs would always burn military boot camp with group push ups and sit ups hour long planking on chairs or the floor i once fought back and dislocated her thumb end up being told to run by dad only to have him drag me down to my feet lots of cleaning she once held a snake hook against my cheek and said no one would miss me if i died theres drawings in the journal one labeled the forgotten daughter and also ramblings about how i thought 8th grade would go this is only a small picture of the damage my stepmom did and she never served any time for any of it i just want people to know the horrific shit she did to me because thats the only reason she had to send me away the state just stepped in to place me in foster care before she could send me to my mom you shouldve killed me instead heather,post-pandemic

every time i try to search how to make friends on google or chatgpt its just to go to some kind of interest clubs or volunteering if i cant go and just start talking to a stranger out of my choice i have no idea how that increases the chance of anyone approaching me because if that isnt what i needed then there wouldnt be any point into going to such place or making friends overall but i am a little bit desperate as my friends from elementary school are stupidly difficult to contact and i feel kinda uncomfortable with them dunno how to end this post did doing the things i mentioned actually allowed you to meet new friends,post-pandemic

i think im just typing this out to vent but if you have any adviceexperiences to share it will be greatly appreciated about two weeks ago i smoked for the first time in a few months and almost immediately i felt this panicky doom set in my heart then started to race causing chest pain and i became so lightheaded and felt like i was going to die i was terrified that i was having a heart attack but the only thing that kept me from dialing 911 was being aware of the fact that getting too high can cause this kind of reaction i monitored my heart rate with my fitbit and throughout the attack it varied from about 90130 bpm after going through multiple episodes of hot and cold sweats and trying to breathe it finally passed and i was exhausted i decided to try and go to sleep while making the easy decision that i should never smoke again since it caused me to have the first panic attack of my life but then it happened again today for a second time even though i havent smoked since the first attack i was actually excited today because i made a plan to get back into walking since i hadnt been very active the past three months i took a little scoop of preworkout but procrastinated for about two hours then i finally went outside and started my walk about 30 minutes in i look at my fitbit to see the amount of steps ive taken so far just for reference back when i took daily walks id try to shoot for about 10k steps which never made my heart rate go higher than about 150 bpm for the couple of streets that included a steep incline so today when i checked my fitbit and saw that i was only 2k steps in with a heart rate of 170 bpm without even walking any steep inclinations yet i was kinda shocked and decided to head back home once i got back i sat down and drank some water while eating a banana i told myself my heart rate was only high because of the cold and not being used to walking anymore after a few minutes my heart rate went back down to about 90100 bpm but i still felt off and began to wonder if there is something wrong with my heart i then started to become shaky and felt a couple of heart flutters so i went to go sit under a hot shower hoping i could relax there wrong after 10 mins of attempting to calm down it hit me like a truck my heart started pounding and i was shaking violently with weakness and lightheadedness once again i thought i was having a heart attack and was on the verge of dying except this time it was scarier because i couldnt blame it on getting high eventually it subsided after focusing on my breathing which was scary in itself because ive never felt my lips quiver like that just from trying to breathe deeply now im writing this 6 hours later exhausted and traumatized a part of me is still scared that maybe it was a heart attack or my heart endured some kind of damage from the first attack i just dont know why this is happening for the first time in my life after nearly 26 years,post-pandemic
hello i have recently gained a lot of weight from 600mg of quetiapine and was wondering if the keto diet is a good idea for weight loss since my body is now sensitive to carbs lowering it to 20g a day and consuming 1900 calories might be a good way to lose fat especially since the body enters into ketosis using fat as fuel instead of carbs the problem is im not sure if i am also sensitive to fats even if they are healthy what are your personal experiences with this diet are there better ways to lose weight i am also planning on swimming in the mornings and boxing resistance training in the evenings right now i only swim,post-pandemic

just a warning i mention self harm bulimia and restricting in this post its a long one but any advice is greatly appreciated so i 18f have been with my bf 18m for almost 9 months now 5 of those months long dist bc of school with periodic visits and ive been struggling with bulimia for almost 17 months my bf has known about it since before we were dating he was the first person i willingly told i was in therapy last year until school started and this semester i started seeing a new therapist my boyfriend is so kind loving understanding and funny even though some bad things have happened to me in the past i feel so undeniably safe with him and i really love him more than anything which makes all of this so much worse he really has helped me with my ed over the time weve dated but lately hes been cracking down more on trying to get me to recover he confronted me a few weeks ago over the phone and said that he and a bunch of our friends from back home a few of which he told w out my permission were so worried about me and i was killing myself and he couldnt watch it anymore he said that he felt ineffective as a bf from what some friends have said to him and that he just watched and did nothing about me getting worse i felt so bad and my heart broke in half when i heard him crying and telling me how worried he was he said that if i didnt get better before when he was supposed to visit for v day he wasnt coming i didnt take this well and of absolutely no fault of hishad a really rough next few days barely checking my phone sh relapse drinking and so he was even more concerned we had another talk and he said that he was just so stressed and all of it had been taking a toll on him and if i didnt seriously make progress he was going to break up with me i was crying so hard the whole time and just felt so helpless we were arguing and he said he thought i needed a higher level of care and therapy wasnt enough he was thinking of telling my parents who have known like the whole time and i was arguing that being hospitalized wouldnt do anything for me no longer uw have a regular heartbeat no longer anemic and i couldnt afford to take a semester off and waste tuition we talked for hours debated taking a break but came to the conclusion that if i kept being in this state he couldnt be with me and i agreed i felt so helpless and like i was being punished for a problem that feels so impossible to control but at the same time i dont want to keep doing this to him the next week was pretty good but i still had a few episodes that i decided not to tell him about even though he made me promise him i wouldnt lie fast forward to now hes visiting and we had a great v day and im so happy hes here even though ive gotten better for now with the bp he said he noticed i was barely eating and i promised to eat normally when we talked over the phone i told him its hard for me to eat normally without triggering a binge and that i was trying my best to do it one step at a time he told me he wanted me to eat a nice meal with him and that it had to be at least xxx cals i was like wtf but he made me look through restaurants that had nutrition info on their website for a dinner we could get i told him i really didnt want to to which he told me if i didnt eat he wouldnt eat and whatever id get hed get i tried to explain to him that saying that really isnt helpful and as a 63 guy that has more lean mass than me a 55 girl we had different nutritional needs i talked to his friend who told him to confront me and he said that he doesnt know if hes serious about breaking up with me but hes watched him cry so many times empty his bank account on plane tickets and just do so much for me yet it feels like im not putting the same amount of work in that was infuriating as ive made and bought him countless gifts bought half the plane tickets we both worked summer jobs i just worked 3 different ones so i got to save a bit more and in my opinion excluding my ed and occasional depressive episodes im the best partner i can be im just feeling so lost now i really want to recover but i know i shouldnt do it for anyone else even if its the person i care about the most and all of my close friends every time i say something like this he treats it as me trying to get him to ignore it but all of this pressure is so much i dont know how to explain to him that i need to do this by myself and the best way for him to support me is just being there for me and not bruteforcing me into recovery i just want to stay with him but it feels like all ive been doing is hurting him and even if it would literally destroy me maybe letting him move on would be whats best for him any advice would be appreciated thanks for reading,post-pandemic

im so sick of how fast the cans pile up cant put them in the trash because my roommates will see them all so i walk them to the dumpster a quarter mile away and i only want to do that once or twice a weekthere are always unfinished cans from when i fell asleep that i need to first pour out and it is a pain after only a night of drinking my bedstand is full of ugly empty cans then when it hits two or three nightswow its like having a constant insect infestation the empty cans are like cockroaches it is a constant eyesore and nuisance i hate hearing the cans jingle when i open the bedroom door and i obviously particularly hate it when one that still has a small amount of liquid falls or gets tipped over somehow i love it when i take them out and it is suddenly clean but then feel so discouraged when later that night i have 15 empty cans of beer by my bed after a single day of drinking cant drink liquor because i have had multiple attacks of acute pancreatitis and liquor was generally the culprit liquor always causes me issues and i avoid it,post-pandemic
i feel like when people talk about having bipolar parents or exs theyre like you never knew how they would act and other stereotypes is this just because of dumb stereotypes from movies and stuff or is this typical im bp2 so obviously my symptoms are less severe but i feel like when im hypomanic its more of an internal feeling like i feel rushed and energized and optimistic and motivated and on the outside i might seem really productive but i dont think it would seem like somethings outwardly wrong if you just looked at me i feel like my interactions with people were relatively normal i talked a lot but i dont think a normal person would think of that as overly weird or anything my close friends will bring it up to me if it seems like im partying too much or making weird decisions but besides that i dont think people notice and when im depressed i isolate myself and might seem a little sad or something but in public its easy to fake not being depressed in either state i never lash out at people and hardly ever seem outwardly upsetn or agitated my personality doesnt change is this how bp2 generally presents is this how all bipolar besides like psychotic mania generally presents or is the stereotype of not knowing how a bipolar person will react to stuff real,pre-pandemic

we forget things that we genuinely care about hell we forget about things that we ourselves are interested in theres no controlling who it happens to or what its about if it can be remembered it can also be forgotten meds dont give us perfect memory dont shame yourself for forgetting it happens a lot do the best that you can to resolve the problem and make the best of it edit 1 holy shit this blew up im glad i was a source of much needed validation of your experiences and reality guys also just a fun note this post was inspired by the constant misunderstanding that neurotypical people seem to have about us when it comes to remembering they dont realize that our brains just refuse to recall information regardless of the time span between receiving it and trying to recall it my wife was unfortunately one of these people until i just showed her this post and the comments you guys helped my wife understand whats really going on she said she wont ever get mad at me for forgetting and to remind her of this post when she does thank you guys for that thanks for the silver you know who you are,pre-pandemic
hello i am curious why adhd is considered a bad thing among pretty much everyone i realize adhd can be a bad thing in many or all scenarios in the modern world but i dont see why that makes adhd a bad thing the goal of medication is not to fix yourself the goal is to change your temperament to be more suited to the work and school environment adhd medication does not fix me because i am not broken having adhd does not make me disabled or mentally ill it is just an element of my personality i have noticed that people with adhd can bring up really interesting topics and dish out oneliners like no one else i have also found that people with adhd are very compassionate spontaneous and sensitive i have a unique way of viewing the world and a unique personality adhd shouldnt be considered a disorder because it is who i am yes i get distracted easily fidget constantly and cant remember things after a few minutes but that is who i am it is only a negative because of the world that we live in tldr adhd is not a disorder you should love your personality adhd and all adhd folks have generally great personality traits something often overlooked by everyone,pre-pandemic
i speak to a lot of people with health anxiety and i notice a lot of people here have an insanely high caffeine and sugar intake reducing this can actually stop a lot of health anxiety behaviours and symptoms here is why what happens in our brain with health anxiety our brains can be very stupid and illogical at times they havent evolved that much from thousands of years ago when we saw a dangerous animal our bodies would react with anxiety and fear causing the fight or flight mode to be activated when the fight or flight mode is activated it changes your brain slightly there is a part of your brain called the amygdala which becomes super active during this stage and heightens your emotional responses in a dangerous situation such as seeing a tiger overthinking can actually hinder your survival so the prefrontal cortex which proccesses logical stuff actually reduces in activity at the same time cortisol and adrenaline is released in your body these hormones help your body physically prepare to fight or run however they also disrupt memory and logical thinking when we hear or have a thought that we may have x condition a lot of the time the fight or flight mode gets activated in our brain its a very strong compulsion to act to effectively save ourselves however the amygdalas overactivation makes it difficult to assess whether symptoms are anxietyrelated or indicative of a health issue this uncertainty and inability to rationalize can increase the need for reassurance perpetuating the cycle of anxiety health conditions arent usually a fight or flight type thing they dont require immediate action but because our minds is trying to save us our logical part of our prefrontal cortex reduces so it makes it so much harder for us to understand that these conditions are super unlikely to be actually happening to us why caffeine is bad for anxiety caffeine functions as a stimulant in that it energizes your central nervous system it may also cause tachycardia hypertension and feelings of excitability or nervousness caffeine also releases adrenalin which is also literally called the fightandflight hormone it is triggered by caffeine in the adrenal gland the adrenaline makes sure that the body reacts quickly to stress through increased heart rate high blood pressure and more energy caffeine prevents the production of the neurotransmitter adenosine which normally induces sleep it obstructs adenosine resulting in further release of other transmitters like dopamine and norepinephrine which causes further increase in neuronal activation effectively when you take caffeine especially in high dosages your body will be constantly in a state of fight or flight and when you are in this state of self induced fight or flight your brain will be trying its hardest to seek what exactly the danger is and health anxiety is the perfect area for the brain to settle if it cannot seek an immediate danger sugar also can push your body to go into flight or fight mode because it causes your pancreas to release insulin if you consume too much sugar in a short period your body will produce a lot of insulin in response to a rapid drop in blood sugar the body will release stress hormones including adrenaline which again pushes you into that fight or flight mode rewiring your brain in cbt there is something called the three systems model this states there is three main states we are in 1 drive system acheiving goals consuming food accomplishing tasks going to the bathroom etc 2 threat system managing threats survival escaping fear etc 3 soothing system slowing down sleeping relaxing spending time with friends playing video games watching movies etc etc now the issue with anxiety and especially health anxiety is that we spend way too long in number two which is the threat system which means we can get stuck in flight or fight mode you maybe here due to nothing causing it you literally can be here from drinking too much caffeine but your brains illogical part shuts down and then you attribute the threat to be the medical condition you have the goal is to try and move your default state into the soothe system and not into the threat system and caffeine is one of the main causes for being in the threat system when you dont need to be x200b,post-pandemic

my partner and i currently work opposite shift patterns i do 85 and he works from roughly 5 well into when im sleeping it can be 1 3 5 or 7 we never know it sucks but that how life is sometimes we live together and for most of the week the only time i see him is when hes asleep the problem is i cant help falling back into old habits when hes not around my problem is alcohol on the nights hes not here 5 nights a week i drink until i black out purely because hes not there to hold me accountable ive told myself a million times i shouldnt need him around but when we were working the same hours i was sober for months its starting to affect my work and i fucking love my job and dont want to lose it im luckily a functioning alcoholic but ive doubled my intake in the last twelve months and am paranoid my coworkers know he worked six days this week because of the super bowl and i was already a mess then today he woke up super late because he didnt get home until late last night and he was out the door after a few hours this is the only day we have together and i feel like every week he has a work training thing or work meal if not he always ends up having to do something with his friends today they have a meal hes out again and ive had 4 drinks already sat alone playing videos games by myself i literally had a dream last night that i slept for almost 24 hours and no one bothered to wake me up or tell me it was abnormal because in my dream he was just gone from when i was home at 5pm until 8pm the next day im easygoing i dont want to rely on him or guilt trip him i want to be in a relationship where we can function as two individuals and not one unit but i dont want to be in a relationship like this hell eat out with his coworker at 4am after work but he hasnt eaten out with me in over a year apart from when i took him on an overnight trip in january and he had no choice but to eat with me in the hotel restaurant i dont think its malicious or even conscious i think hes genuinely just oblivious and comfortable but i have no idea how to cope i dont have family and i dont know how to build relationships without making them romantic ive brought up having an open relationship but hes against it and honestly im not that into it either i just want someone who is present at least a couple of nights a weeks to keep me away from myself every therapist ive had has spent months trying to get to the point and reeled off something incredibly trite to conclude and im at the end of my tether how do i cope how do i confront this without selfsabotaging i want a relationship where im not the last prioroty and yet im here sacrificing my physical health for someone i live with who cant even give me one night our sex life is amazing when we can make time for it we are so in sync when we talk we have laughing fits so why do i feel like this relationship is damaging me in the long run am i selfish do normal couples spend this little time together ive fucked up and ruined so many friendships when i was at my worst i dont have anyone to ask and im supposed to be better now thank you for any advicehelp,post-pandemic

im not autistic but my very young son is he doesnt seem the better for it at least not right now i joined this subreddit as a potential source of learning more i am surprised to see so much background talk about accepting the condition for what it is i dont understand this maybe im not understanding what people are saying we have to accept things we cannot change but that doesnt mean we should mischaracterize reality and autism still seems like damage not just difference am i getting that wrong why do people think so we all have damage in some way maybe youre diabetic have depression are missing a limb or are below average intelligence in some area but that doesnt mean we dont excel elsewhere and it doesnt mean we dont have dignity or are deserving of respect i dont see any of those beliefs as inconsistent with recognizing autism as requiring some remedying,pre-pandemic
i have a very hard time with not knowing the specifics of why people perceive me the way they do when someone tells me they love me i want to know why they love me what things ive done to make me lovable when someone tells me im pretty i want to know why they think im pretty or kind or funny or any compliment i get if someone says they had a good time with me i want to know why it was good i want to know things i did to make them believe these things i sometimes get upset at generic compliments because i love them to be specific to me and not something that could be said to anyone i dont know why i think this way and i wish i could be 100 okay with any compliment,pre-pandemic
bit of a strange one i think but id like peoples advice if they have any i work in an office of women and theres an office of men near us who are really nice im a bit quiet but i get on well with the women in my office and im getting on better with the men in the other office and i think theyre really funny so id like to keep getting to know them all i just found out that another young girl is joining their office in a couple of weeks and at first i was really excited but then i started worrying that they will start being nice to this girl and not want to talk to me anymore i think this stems from the fact that ive never had a boyfriend and all boys who ive nearly dated have just been using me for sx and then found someone else i also dont have a close relationship with my family so i feel like this feeling im having may stem from the fact that i think boys only like me because im pretty i guess if they do start talking to this other girl more and stop talking to me then they were never really my friends in the first place but im generally feeling pretty lonely at the moment as all my friends are at uni too and this just isnt helping does anyone have any advice,post-pandemic

hi all x200b ill try to write this in a few words im trying to find evidence of a link between that genes that give us autistic traits and physical strength as it happens to me ill explain below and have a video below for you to see its not a joke its a serious questionstudy i have x200b i think autism could be a wonderful thing although i realize its not always the case but i found i was aspergerautism level 1 some weeks ago and everything in my life made more sense than before x200b i tried to find out if i was when i found some hidden papers from my childhood telling that between 2 and 6 years old i was a more severe case of autism child not talking to anyone agressive isolating myself etc between 6 and 8 i improved a lot since then i had a wonderful life and nowadays im just a mild autistic person and never imagined i was x200b as i now know how to talk to people recognize sarcasm and use it almost eliminated my obsessive compulsive disorder got used to look peoples in the eyes doesnt mean i like it can make friends talk to strangers etc x200b im just very distracted which now i know its the reason that my relationships all went bad once i turned around and noticed that my girlfriend was 40 feet back staring at me saying you werent listening to me you dont love me etc so my distraction destroys relationships and i dont feel the need to be with people but besides that my life seems perfect this way i have 911 autistic traits from the known panflets about autism but always lived a neurotypical life x200b i even got to have perfect motor skills etc x200b now i learned that some of my physical traits came from autism like my hypersensitivity to light my hypersensitivity to sounds even listen to my neighbours discussions pain tolerance probably my cold tolerance can stand below 0c 30 farenheit just in a tshirt not feeling cold x200b and i know i have a really unusual strength i can roll 3 or 4 frying pans together as if they were mazagines i can bend horseshoes with my hands bend steel bars adjustable wrenches but having a height of 511 and a bodyweight of 140lbs body mass index 19 to 20 never had training before x200b of course then i started doing feats and improved but my base strength was too high x200b check an example x200b i know i look pretty neurotypical but i guess nobody will say that to me here as ive heard also from my friends that you dont look autistic i have grown to be almost neurotypical besides my adhd walking on the street with mathematical patterns like fibonacci loving to be alone etc on the video i may look some neurotypical guy if thats what you might think but i still have 911 from the 14 basic autistic traits x200b they say my brain compensated at my time there wasnt a 2e child i would be autistic or not autistic just that my mother insisted for me to go to a public school no special teaching and i adapted luckily because of my brain for what they say i learn everything very quickly am a selftaught polymath x200b i cant go higher on my trainings because when bending unbraced using only hands or wrists steel bars that require above 600lbs of force to bend i start having blood coming out from the pores of my skin and hear my heartbeat intracranial blood pressure too high and risk of brain hemorrage etc so i stopped training because i found my bodys limits but not my strength limit though x200b i think this may come from autism x200b i even made a video telling that to find others but its in a terrible english x200b i think it would be too much of a coincidence for me to have adapted to society very well in my point of view because people say im a little antisocial as im very introvert but not shy and besides all the cool traits i had having also this huge physical strength x200b so i thought it must have come from the aspergers also x200b and once someone told me like it seems you want to be like da vinci as i specialized in several areas like computer programming technical analysis on finantial markets etc but also painted created and play music etc and i answered no i would never be like him ive very strong and he wasnt x200b after all i was mistaken da vinci was very very strong and was able to bend horseshoes with his hands like me and he was asperger like me x200b so there must be a link here x200b im not saying all aspergers or autistic persons are very strong maybe its a rare gift but i believe there is a relation x200b i thought in creating that video so that i would reach very strong and light some steel benders and oldtimestrongmen hoping some of them would be aspergers x200b i thought that if there were like 1 aspergers in population or autistic persons like me and i would find 10 or 20 or 30 of aspergers in the middle of the strongest guys ive found there would be a link x200b but they usually dont like the idea to do asperger tests some due to religion issues someone explained that it would lead to discussions others because they dont see themselves as autistic like i never did because i was ignorant in that area so i didnt have much luck convincing them to do the tests x200b so my only option left was to ask autistic persons like me if they knew cases of that and here i am x200b there is a point in this oldtime strongmen in the past always said this dennis rogers says x200b that each one has a governor our heads that limits us like a chip in a car that if we take the chip out it would be a lot faster but blow up its engine sooner a measure to protect us x200b some say some persons have more tolerant governors letting them use more strenght when their lives are at risk they call it hysterical strength but its a rare phenomenon difficult to study x200b you can see one explanation for this x200b you can see in the middle they notice he has a lot more muscle acceleration than usual he has a lot more muscle fibers being activated at once than the typical human being i have no clue if hes aspie or not though x200b and this comes from our brains more muscle fibers activated at once by each motorneurons we have or having more motorneurons or activating more than usual etc etc x200b so it comes from our minds as human beings are a lot stronger than we imagine we are just limited to a certain ammount of strength for our own sake and some persons can go beyond that having no limits x200b as i have that rolling frying pans with my hands the first time ive tried and adjustable wrenches with no train for 10 years before and 140lbs for 511 tall i have that surely x200b now i was a more severe case of autism in childhood nowadays everybody think im a typical neurotypical person but im asperger still x200b there must be a link im certain of that and i notice certain oldtimestrongmen in the past like mighty atom in the us seemed asperger to me introverts focused on certain hobbies etc x200b on the asperger section nobody had clear answers maybe here some of you have x200b do you know examples of stronger than usual persons being autistic specially level 1 autismasperger to be sure it happens also in aspergers like me thats its a trait possible in mild autism also x200b if so tell me your opinion on this or where should i find examples i want to test my theory and find answers and know what gave me this strength autism or i was simply gifted with strength also x200b by the way this is a serious question im really interested to find out im not claiming to be super man or something x200b or it would be very important if you know do you know some specialist that may study these things and give me answers someone that studies autistic traits etc x200b thanks,pre-pandemic

i have a problem with isolating myself when splitting i feel ashamed of the thoughts i have towards the person im splitting on so consistently ill leave any groups im in with them have a sort of internal fight with myself on blocking them but settle on just deleting the number and then get mad at myself for my behavior for example today my friend and i got into a not really argument i asked if they wanted to be left alone and they said yes i respect that i understand i was being a lot but despite that i realized that after we got off call i was splitting painting them in an entirely negative light when that wasnt fair to them so i left all possible groups we were in together deleted our messages and im now just sitting in my bed mad at myself its like i was splitting on them but then turned it inward and began splitting on myself im getting off track i know its not healthy to act like this and i want to improve and get better its just difficult i self isolate all the time even when im not splitting on someone it can just be from a mood swing im currently isolating myself from my friends and support right now and had to sit here for 10 minutes convincing myself to make this post does anyone have advice or have gone through this before i dont know what to do this just hurts me and the people i isolate from and i want to stop what should i do,post-pandemic
in your experience were teachers understanding and supportive or were they ableist cruel i assume its going to be a mix of both if people reply to this post so i guess the bigger question is looking back what is your overall impression of how teachers treated you,post-pandemic
heres an example i use to explain to others what happens when im tasked with something over the years task has meant homework housework work assignments group tasks personal hobbies fill in the blank situation 1 say you ask someone neurotypical to do task a you need it done in 3 hours they look at it and see about 10 steps needed complete it they work for 2 hours and get 9 of those 10 done good enough they think in their mind theyre ending with a mental todo list 90 finished they go relax for an hour if they got a grade a they walk away feeling good having finished a task and doing it pretty well so 9 out of 10 tasks in 2 hours thats roughly one task every 15 mins to get 90 done and an hour to relax internal score a now situation 2 you ask me adhd 2e to do task a i look and see 100 possible details i catch a vision of what task a could be and am extremely excited by it i see how task a fits into other tasks b c d e f and how it makes them easier for other people task a if done right can support itself help the people who need to do it after me and potentially generate enough resources to create new tasks w x ydare i say even z man if i can get this done task a will be incredible this feelingits electric at first glance i can see at least 9 details related to and needing accounted for each of the original 10 steps im unfamiliar with a couple of the details so ill need to do some research to resolve my questions whats more there are irrelevant details buried in the pile but i dont know which ones yet so ill need to be actively sifting those out while i work for the next 4 hours i work on it like crazy riding the wave of my excitement guided by the image in my head im working hard to get it done but because of distractibility i get sidetracked other random tasks add to that ive come up with 1020 more unforeseen and potentially irrelevant details its okay though im getting momentum and really starting to weave the threads together my focus is having holes poked in it because people keep interrupting me its not malicious they are just being friendly by saying hi or trying to get me to smile because i look so intense they dont know how hard im holding my focus together and that every distraction is like a wind gust against my attentional house of cards theres been some unravelling but i try to shake off my anger and get back to reweaving them quickly ive been working at a pace of about one task every 5 mins i look up and realize its been 4 hours crap im an hour over i take stock of where im at i have crossed 48 tasks off my mental todo list of now 120 but am only about 40 finished thats a big mental f in more ways than one so 48 of 120 tasks in 4 hours one task every 5 minutes and only 40 done score f this is how people with adhd can work twice as long work 3x faster complete more than 5x the amount of tasks see over 1000 more detailand still feel like crap for not getting anything done okayi try to take stock of where i am at the pace i was going it will take me 10 hours to finish the break has made me realize i havent eaten im starting to feel bad im mentally exhausted and my brain is fried im way over my deadline and it was needed an hour ago at this stage its not even finished enough to be usable this isnt the first time this has happened far from it so now im also feeling defeated i also feel demotivated because i dont actually know how much longer its going to take me to finish so i engage in procrastination as a stress relief tool now im working much slower because experiencing this pattern is what kickstarts a depression this always happens i look at what i still need to do its likely going to take me a possible 50 hours to work through the remaining 72 tasks i feel need to get done the end of the task stretches away toward the horizon like a long vast road man this sucks every minute i continue is a slog that drags me down further but it has to get done i stay up all night working on it the silence and lack of interruption helps but its still slow in the morning come the text messages people asking me questions about the task some innocuous hey just checking on the status of task a some not hey we need task a to be done as soon as possible we have people waiting on it when will you be done i feel shame an immediate dread that feels like daggers stress cortisol and adrenaline coursing through my body like a weird familiar fire and then an immediate dive into a full depression i feel they are justified in their frustration im frustrated with me too why does this always happen why cant i just get things done why is this so hard for me when its so easy for other people why cant i just think more simply and then to add to the heartbreak man this could be so useful and so greatif i could just get it done i suck i hate this feeling i wish i wasnt such a failure its a strange thing we have its the source of my creativity and wonder and also the source of my darkest times that feeling fades and some things get better but this pattern seems to be close at all times i feel like im always trying to defend why creative people seem to struggle getting things done while its exacerbated by adhd it is also a problem with creative types while they are commonly judged as flaky or undisciplined i really think it has to do with the challenge of having more dots to connect than the average person and then having to deal with the mental repetitive stress injuries that come from weathering others lack of understanding which then only reflexes back onto the problem like a serpent that is eating its own tail,pre-pandemic

does anyone else experience this flavor of crazy i can meet someone and have the most interesting charming fun intelligent conversation that engages my mind and my sense of humor on many levels all of them pleasant and then i dont want to see them again because it feels like i cant be her again even though she is no more interesting charming fun or intelligent than i am i wasnt putting on an act when i met that person i was instead somehow able to enter a tiny window of not feeling self conscious i might even think something like ah the problem was that i hadnt been meeting interesting enough people but now that i have ill be okay and can have a solid friend then suddenly i feel like if i made someone like me or warm up to me i can only let them down next time or that id have to fake it to be with them again in reality i didnt make them do anything they probably simply liked me but the thought of that throws my mind into all sorts of turmoil because i dont know who it was that they liked i end up feeling a lot safer but emptier and much more lonely hanging around people who are so self centered that they barely know the other person is there or has any feelings,pre-pandemic
this morning my dad went on a rant about how people who dont add anything to society should die all i could think about is how thats just me im useless im unwanted i might not be a convicted criminal but im definitely never going to be useful to society i dont agree with him in any other case but in my case yeah i should be killed i cant get enough courage to do it myself but i still very much want it to happen i cant see a day when ill not be like this useless and suicidal these are just two things that im meant to be i dont want to be them but here i am kill me please,pre-pandemic

sometimes i get a good day where i feel like i have a lot of clarity i figure its worth trying to share with others here are some reminders even doctors have to go to doctors because self diagnosis is incredibly unreliable the times that people have died from undiagnosed silent conditions is far far far less than the amount of times that those conditions were present enough to cause concern in the patient and get it fixed or treated our bodies are incredible alarm systems the symptoms of dehydration and lack of food are very very very real and are often very similar to a lot of the scarier symptoms of more serious things think about it even if youre a little hungry or dehydrated your body is going to want you to know its going to cause nondangerous symptoms it really really all could be just that especially with how common dehydration is in the modern human everything is a risk factor no i promise im not saying this in a scary way im saying that calling small things risk factors is sort of part of the fearmongering that the internet does when it comes to health stuff the term gets thrown around so easily about such small normal things that its basically not worth considering most of the time if youre anything like me then you probably live a very sedentary life just remember that when you are sitting around doing nothing your mind has all that free space to fill with health anxiety and cause fake symptoms you can reliably assume that you are taking your symptoms too seriously and scaring yourself too much on a normal basis if you have gone to the length to be subscribed to this subreddit and be reading this post right now everyone has weird symptoms everyone all the time anything you can think of my dad lived with chest pain for years and years when he was in his 20s and hes now 61 and entirely healthy the average lifespan is the average for a reason if you are under that age especially if you are very young the odds are intrinsically in your favor remember occams razor also that age is continuing to go up,pre-pandemic

long story short i go to a technical college that has a very strict attendance policy which requires students to have upwards of 95 attendance through the entire year going under that threshold would mean getting removed from the program entirely this last week i came down with covid and if you can guess i had gone under that 95 threshold had to attend a meeting to explain why ive been out and so i could potentially not get removed they ultimately decided that it was fair to let me stay in the course but are only allowing me 2 hours to lose between now graduation you can imagine im filled with anxiety right now because i have upwards of 12 weeks between now and graduation anything can happen between now then that would cause me to be late or whatever and my overall motivation about class is waning now i dont really have any options other than stick this out hopefully dont miss any dayshours or drop out start at a different college entirely id like to at least get one more cert as my college offers three certs for the program im taking before dropping out but what do you all think i should do,post-pandemic

tw this turned into a selfhatred rant so dont read if youre sensitive to that stuff i literally restrict for a few days then i binge and then it just repeats i just want something anything to change i dont even care if i even gain weight right now i just need some proof that this cycle of weightmaintaining can end and i can eventually maintain through eating a normal amount each day when i start a good day i overeat because im so scared of scarcity and pure starvation again then i dont eat some days because i remember how many cookies and bread slices i had the day before i am trapped within my own head and no one would even care because they cant see it its truly all in my head went from an exhausted anorexic to a severely depressed binge eater to whatever the fuck this is hell i havent even seen the world yet im only 15 and ive already ruined everything for myself and my family i wish i was born normal and didnt have to end up with a screwed up brain i wish i could have at the bare minimum just remained anorexic so people would care about me i could be skinny and pretty but now im just fat and no one gives a fuck i honestly hope i get a stomach virus again and lose a shit ton of weight again and missing school would be the added bonus,post-pandemic
thanks to everyone who gave support because of you i didnt kill myself,pre-pandemic
there appears to be some sort of confusion about what my actual issue is when i did my intake a few months ago i told him about restricting and what my calorie limits were no numbers but certainly less than a healthy amount but also that i havent been counting lately to try and recover i also told him that i have a history of purging or using laxatives when i go over those calorie limits but again its something i havent been doing in an effort to recover and since moving in with new people last time i was in treatment i was at a higher bmi than i am now and diagnosed with anbp because i was restricting and purging when i had anything i considered to be too much this time i was diagnosed with bulimia he said because my bmi is normal and i have a history of purging since starting weve been doing cbte worksheets its basically a food log where i indicate if i felt like the meal was too much if i purged and then write about the contextfeelings i am not allowed to write the calories though as someone who has a long history of keeping food diaries this is pretty easy for me to do but has led to more restriction and writing down the food also makes me judge the quantities higher so ive been indicating that food is too much pretty frequently still not purging though since starting the logs ive lost a not insignificant amount of weight im not sure if hes only reading the feelings portion and not what i eat or what but the majority of our time seems to be focused on reducingcontrolling my binges except that i rarely if ever binge to me finishing a normally portioned meal feels like too much so ill indicate it on the log and we focus so much on those indications and specifically on how i can say no when people offer me meals i dont want to eat and stop the finish the plate mentality that i have which yeah sure feeling obligated to finish meals is definitely an issue but it feels basically like im being given restriction tips shouldnt he be encouraging me to not feel bad about eating meals and in fact to eat more honestly im not sure how to address this i brought up once before that i dont think i should be treated for bulimia because thats not really my problem i forget what he said though the stupid ed brain solution is to just keep restricting until im underweight and meet the diagnostic criteria for anorexia which i told him that plan but again i forget how the conversation went but the end result of that plan is still recovery because i do want to get better wanting to doesnt seem to be enough though and i need help feeling comfortable with normal portions and meal times it feels like im getting the opposite of that right now other than that though im really glad to be in therapy because its hard to get treatment in my city and im really lucky that he took me on as a patient right after intake wait time after intake is usually 6 months hes leaving the practice in july so i imagine ill go on another waitlist when that happens so in the meantime i dont want to quit,post-pandemic
im not trying to make fun of the people who post here trust me ive worked myself up about any and all physical symptoms my whole life but often when im scrolling through reddit ill see someones post and think oh that poor anxious person theres like a 1 chance theyre actually suffering from what theyre worried about and yet i never seem to be able to be this rational about my own ha,pre-pandemic
i have adhd i used to take ritalin for it it worked great then i had a manic episode stopped ritalin im stable now and taking meds for the mania so i tried ritalin again started with once a day in the morning that worked fine i slept like a rock then i moved on to twice a day nope could not fucking sleep even though it was a solid 10 hours between taking ritalin and going to bed obviously i cant sacrifice sleep that could trigger a manic episode once a day adhd medication is better than nothing but come on how am i supposed to function at say a full time job if i only get 45 hours of treatment a day i see my psych on tuesday maybe hell have alternative suggestions id be down to experiment with other types such as adderall to see if its ritalin in particular keeping me awake or maybe a once a day long acting stimulant would work im just annoyed because ritalin twice a day used to work so well and it sucks that i cant keep at it,post-pandemic
my son who is 8 years old was just recently diagnosed with adhd im a recovering addict and i really am not sold on giving my son medications he has absence seizures which could go away when he hits puberty but im trying to get his dose stable on that before we start working on treating the adhd ive been doing some research and the first thing were going to work on is his diet eating heailther finding good vitamins or minerals that could help less screen time more hands on play activities more excerise and for school therapy and implementing a 504 plan working with the school to help him be successful i would like to hear from people who have adhd and what you wish you knew before making decisions on medications things you wish you knew when diagnosed what has helped you and what hasnt helped you also what else could i do to help my son without medications i believe everyone reacts differently to medications and he might actually need the medications ive heard from some people who say they really needed it others say they wish they never started medication for it and tried a different route so its possible he might need the medication but im trying to avoid that being the first thing i do to help treat it if that makes sense anything you could help suggest or give advice would be greatly appreciated,post-pandemic

so let me elaborate more on my night so around 4 pm i drink one soju thats like 18 alcohol and i already had taken my morning ritalin la 40 mg so i was feeling pretty good ps been off adhd meds for 9 months so my tolerance is zero i preceded to snort another 40 mg of ritalin then i spent some time with my friend and then he often me 300 mg of lyrica so i took it around 500 pm and then he often to sell me some oxycontin 30 mg i got really excited about the oxy but i managed somehow to hold myself back for a little bit by telling my friend ill think about it because i was addicted too oxycodone pretty bad badly like 1 year ago been completely sober from any opiate drugs for 1 year after getting off them cold turkey so i decided to pass them up properly for the better anyways so pick up the bong instead smoked another 5 bowls then cilled for the little then i had 2 double strength vodka red bulls so im feeling pretty wavey and euphoric by now its 730 pm i cooked 2 boiled eggs and ordered some fried chicken then smoked another couple bowls then left my friends place then got home at 1030 pm and drank another bottle of soju 18 of alcohol then 30 min later i snort a another 40 mg of ritalin at 1100 pm so i started writing my post around 1110 pm ps at least tried to write it after deleting my post two times by accident i was feeling pretty pissed off but i was starting to feel less stone and drowsy but still very much relaxed and pretty out of it all together most likely from the lyrica and all the drugs i consumed obviously haha constantly forgetting how to spell every single word haha makes it very difficult so i actually wrote all of this with voice haha thanks guys really sorry about the long post just had to get this off my chest because deep down im feeling pretty lonely most of the time dont really feel like i actually have any real friendships or human connection on a deeper level that dont involve taking drugs feeling really scared im going to lose control again and relapse into my old ways with drugs and getting really fucked up every day like how i used too be like iv been sober for 9 months now sometimes drank but to much anyways thanks again guys would love to hear you opinions,post-pandemic

recently got diagnosed with adhd and going med route i hate going drs always avoid if possible but got to point this treading water in life was getting a bit much and i needed answers well i have been told last week i have adhd now in my mind this is ok i guess as i needed an answer in my mind as was feeling really down about being basically lazy and b not being able to get my shit together told im a shit wife lazy ect ect ect i know that family wont approve neither would husband how many of you havent told anyone about your diagnosis would this cause complications further down the line kinda thinking if the meds provide help and relief then i wouldnt need to tell them it would just help me more and settle things someone talk to me lol the only people that knows at the moment is 2 close friends xx,post-pandemic
it seems like my cat does not understand that i have autism when i am home alone my cat becomes well just another neurotypical often he has no concept that i may need alone time that i feel tired etc it is easier when the weight of socializing with a cat is distributed over to other family but home alone is the worst time because i dont understand what my cat wants from me my internal reaction to a moving thing that is attached to me without my permission is to make it go away but i feel bad about doing this to my and familys cat,pre-pandemic
at least thats how it feels for me sometimes like theyre in a constant tug of war battle on who gets to run my life that day edit this post seems to have really struck a chord with a lot of people sometimes its so interesting to put a thought out into the universe and find out that so many people share it too ive dealt with this crap for a while and this thought has stuck out to me on occasion with a variation of anxiety usually being the thing that holds me back but tbh depression and anxiety tag team it on the reg ill be honest the reddit karma is really validating lmao but its also just really cool to see people interacting in a post about their different struggles and how they worked on it and people offering encouragement and advice and people just showing up and saying i feel this im on a weird reddit karma high rn i literally dont know why its just internet points lolz so i feel like this sounds allwow you guys upvotes me lol but i just wanted to add that this is one of the most supportive communities on reddit thank you guys and dont stop believing not meant to be a journey reference but ill leave it that better things will come better days are coming and will come and i know because today was a good day today was a day where i got to make things happen the tiniest most minuscule things that i put on my to do list and i know days will get bad again but once again what goes down must come back up eventually and thats the way it is but heres to the good fight why am i getting emotional in a reddit post ok love you internet strangers bye,pre-pandemic

this is going to be a very long post and it will include some triggers mostly from what ive been through and continue to endure ive been unemployed for the past three years nonstop all because im on the spectrum and i disclose it to prove that there is discrimination we need an army of people on the spectrum who record the interviews and get all of these ableist and discriminatory interviewers fired for discrimination for me it has sadly it has been the same with dating ive been single my entire life yet ive dated multiple girls as soon as i told each of them that im on the spectrum and that i live in a group home because of discrimination they immediately rejected me and dumped me the latest girl that i dated i hid the fact that i had autism from her and we were classmates in the same class together on the fourth date she assumed immediately that i had autism and when i asked her what made her think that she told me that her brother was an aspie as well and she told me that she wanted to work with people on the spectrum i explained to her that i had autism and how my parents punished me for standing up for my rights by sending me to a group home with 24 hr supervision and i also explained that im about to graduate community college and transfer to an outofstate school if my ableist parents who are my legal guardians let me go i also told her that i was anxious about telling her because three girls in a row rejected me when they found out that i was on the spectrum the date ended very well and while we were officially a couple i always thought in the back of my mind that if she found out about my autism she would break up with me immediately because usually when im pessimistic about something im usually right as i was leaving i started making a video just a couple blocks away from my house predicting that she would break up with me via text message not even a few seconds later did she text me saying that she was breaking up with me because i did not tell her that i had autism that she was hurt that i assumed that she would discriminate against me like the others anyway we exchanged some pretty choice words to each other and i saved my text messages to hopefully prove to others what kind of person she really is and the kind of stuff i usually go through later when i went back to class the few friends that i had there all told me that they didnt want to be my friend anymore because i was disrespectful to their friend who was my now my ex after i showed them the texts that she sent me it proved to them that i was right and that she really was discriminating against me by telling me that she was breaking up with me because i didnt tell her that i had autism because i was afraid of how she would react if she found out anyway after that incident she lost the respect of the entire class and i felt good knowing that for once in my life justice was finally served this is exactly why i hate going to my family for dinner whenever i visit my family its a nightmare for me and because im jewish and every time i visit them for sabbath they always body shame and disability shame me and they do it even more so when i criticize them for discriminating against me they would use hypocritical language like dont use your disability as a crutch yet when they discriminate against me for having autism they would tell me that you call yourself smart yet its taking you five years to graduate community college and when i tell them its because of my disability they would tell me again dont use your disability as a crutch its because youre lazy just a week ago in the last week of may i started recording my abusive family and how they were treating me because i wanted to prove to people that my family are not the good angels that they are made out to be and they have and entire dish different script for me in private in fact the real reason im single and unemployed is because of all the discrimination ive been going through and also i am single and friendless and a virgin because of this discrimination as unfortunately most girls in my area just like the rest of the conservative and disability shaming bukharian community have all rejected me when they found out that i have a disability in my community people with disabilities are publicly shunned and shamed i openly criticized my community with a very backward practice of shaming people who are different because of that ive been shamed even more than others and this is why am probably going to be single and lonely for the rest of my life and the same thing with jobs in my area as well perhaps im just meant to be single and unemployed for the rest of my life i dont know what i did in my past life to deserve all this bad luck but i hope my luck will change eventually also ive also been dumped because of my negativity as well thats on me ill admit but the root cause of my negativity is all the discrimination that ive faced and continue to face i want to have a family and have kids and send them off to college but how my ever going to achieve that if im constantly being rejected for having a disability and for expressing myself we need to stand up for one another and give a check for support because no one wants to help us unless we help ourselves first we need to be warriors in the fight against discrimination ableism and discrimination mostly because of autism discrimination over 80 of autistic college graduates are unemployed and the suicide rate among people with autism is the highest of any group in this country disabled or otherwise mostly because of discrimination and unemployment as a result of the discrimination i am an organizer for the autism self advocacy network in new york city and im leading a grassroots effort in new york so people with autism and other disabilities can stand up for themselves and others like them,pre-pandemic

i almost did it yesterday i skipped school and went into the woods with some alcohol and a rope and i planned to end my life i tied the noose and i jumped from a tree miraculously my neck didnt break and and a homeless man came out of nowhere and cut me down in that second that i was hanging from the tree all i could think about was how much of a mistake it was i spent the rest of that day talking with the homeless man and learning about his experiences and i realized that life has its ups and downs but thats what life is you gotta live through the pain because its all experiences not good or bad experiences just experiences thank you mike if you are reading this,pre-pandemic
its incredibly soul crushing and devastating when the addict you left and his parents blame you for the addiction and all the trouble that arose because of it even after ive removed myself they are texting me saying they are scared of me and how its basically my fault their son is addicted when he was addicted 5 years before i met himi myself am sober and never had problems just needed to vent somewhere all i did was try to love and help and this just feels like continued abuse and denial,post-pandemic
i see many schizophrenia medicines like risperidone aripiprazole cause movement disorders etc when stopped abruptly why do not the psychiatrists inform first hand that medicines like valproic acid and trihexiphenidyl can help remove symptoms of sudden stoppage this will remove fear among first time risperidone users also this will encourage their belief in antipsychotic medicines,post-pandemic
the opposite of addiction is connection the addiction is not about the pleasurable effects of substances its the inability to connect with other human beings in a healthy way many say addiction is not a substance disorder it is a social disorder a study had been done on rats that showed when putting a rat in a small cage alone with one bottle of water and one bottle of heroin infused water the rat would choose the heroin water until it killed itself they then put 20 rats in a rat park with other rats wheels toys and lots of other resources they also put a water bottle and a heroin infused water bottle none of the rats chose the heroin infused bottle many of us addicts feel a major loss of connection to other humans as well as to our true higher selves many of us alienate ourselves and lose ourselves while in our addiction pulling us further and further from the people we loved and who loved us as well as far away from the people we were intended to be this leaves us feeling alone broken with no real connection to the world the only connections we have are people who do not hold our best interests at heart we know this if we want to be well we must find true connection again we must find our purpose and surround ourselves with people who align with it people who are there to lift us up so we can lift them up we must do the real work and for once go within ourselves to find ourselves again our truest selves only from within can we heal and regain our lives again we as a society must also realize that we all have a little bit of addiction inside of us it may not be drugs however it may be sex chocolate the gym smoking drama work food shopping relationships coffee gambling our phones or even sugar we are all looking to fill an inner void externally to some extent we will not grow as a society until we realize that not one of us are any better than the other we have more similarities than we have differences and after all we are all after the same things love and peace,pre-pandemic

hey everyone im not sure if this is allowed so mods please take down if deemed inappropriate for this sub but i wanted to share a short film i wrote and directed that is very close to my heart and may resonate with some in this community that being said this film is not pleasant and it is not hopeful but it is honest and those who have seen it and who dont have ha have told me for the first time i can start to understand what youre going through x200b watch here tw please only watch if you feel like youre in a good place mentally the film follows a man who discovers a bump on the back of his head and spirals into madness as someone who deals day to day with ocd specifically with ha and emetephobia i always struggled to properly explain what my struggle really felt like this film is an exploration of what my anxiety and intrusive thoughts feel like invisible illnesses like anxiety depression and ocd are so hard to properly explain to someone whos never experienced it so i wanted to explore it in a visual and tangible experience that i believe is what film as an art form and storytelling tool achieves best i have never seen a realistic depiction of what my mental health issues feel like especially health anxiety and so my goal with this film was to show the rawest and most realistic portrayal of it that i could being able to present these inner demons that myself and many others battle every day and make them digestible so that anyone could experience how debilitating and uncomfortable it is to go through can maybehopefully challenge the way we talk about these things in a way this film is a release of all the thoughts and feelings ive had and have struggled with its been therapeutic to let it out to create a worst case scenario as a reminder to myself how ridiculous it looks when you take a step back from your own inner turmoil and reflect i feel better having made it if please check it out if you have 14 minutes to spare i hope you enjoy it and feel something by it,post-pandemic

trigger warning talk of sexual and physical abusethere is no tl dr i need to vent ive never told anyone the entirety of my life i never wrote down how i felt i want to see if it helps x200b i was physically abused by my father i remember one time he slammedpushed the kitchen table into my chest while i was eating dinner it pressed my chair up against the wall then pushed all the air out of my chest i remember getting tunnel vision and hitting the floor limp as the table was pulled away when i tried to get up while on hands and knees i was kicked in my stomach by him i dont remember anything other than being on the couch and my mom leaving him after that with me and my 2 brothers i was 8 this is one story x200b my great grandfather used to call me worthless and emotionally abuse me because of my ethnicity until i was in my 20s i was reminded daily about how worthless i was over something i had no control over he basically stepped in as the father figure i would spend my summers in southern california helping him super his apartments until i was about 17 x200b i have never told anyone this i was also sexual abused x200b i have never told anyone this i was raped x200b to me those are two separate things when the abuse started i physically enjoyed it had no idea then i was brutally sodomized then i grew up just a little and thats when i started to hate distrust and not like anyone i built a fake smile i built an auto pilot response for everyday things i dont think when i can i do what i can to stop x200b from the ages of 9 to about 14 i was fucking raped weekly by a boy 7 years olderwell call the fat ugly rapist fmc i felt like shit because at the start i liked it i didnt know what was happening to me i just felt by the time i was 12 i started to feel disgusted by 14 i fucking hated everyone i dont care to discuss the last time he abused me but i will say i dont think he ever put himself in the position he was in he left me alone at that point by the time i was 18 i was wrapping up making money by taking it from adults to beat the shit out of under age people i went to school with gang related and they didnt want to get in trouble and hell whats the worst that could happen to me if i get caught i was a minor they all deserved this is just how i felt at the time it and it was my only outlet it was shit like kids stealing and the owners wanting revenge cause a family member seen them with the stolen property at school or someones dad wanted me to scare the shit out of the daughters boyfriend shit like like that the last time i did something like this for example some kid who was a senior over 18 at the time had his stereo stolen he gave me 50 to beat the shit out of the kid who did it 16yo he reminded me of the boy who raped me when i punched that kid all i could see was that fat piece of shit fmc when he was on the ground in the fencing position i drug and slammed him around by is hair into the side walk i picked him off the ground while he was dead weight and rubbed his head in the top of a chain link fence i was expelled and arrested for assault i tested out of high school i have never ever been violent with anyone since then all the way till now and im 36 during my time in school seventh through high school i hated everyone fuck em i had only 1 real friend and i had one crush on a girl one it lasted no less than 2 weeks of fantasizing before fmc learned about it he didnt like it he told david my best friend at the time he had no idea fmc was fucking raping me and new him as a friend of my family that i had made out with her he knew david liked her david pissed from hearing this asked christian of course she denied it it never happened it wasnt true i was now known as a liar she went to church and school with me i was 13 at the time so from grade school right on through to high school if i went to church with you or school i was a liar so the one girl ive ever liked now labeled me and to everyone else a liar my best friend no longer because now im a liar this was what happened the first time i ever told another person i had feelings twards someone else one little bitty crush now no social life destroyed home life also behind the scenes is a literal fucking hell i liked girls was being raped by a 300lb fat fucking boy i hated fmc after my last altercation with him i was close to or at 15 about a year goes by no girls look at me small town i dont like them because they hate me i lie about making out with em i wanted to have sex though to be clear i wanted to fuck i had been fucked i wanted to have joy just once so i had a plan when i was around 16 doing the summer super job for my grandfather i paid a prostitute for my first sexual encounter that mattered because i wanted to know what sex was like with a woman when i got back to northern california after the summer job at gramps i told my older brother and he called me a liar i never told him anything personal up until recently because of that now my family thinks im a liar and hates me to x200b so at this point i am 18 and i fucking hate everyone my dad also starts developing a mental disorder he slowly is becoming mentally disabled i figured fuck him some karma x200b i decide to move out my cousin she moves in with me i was growing weed at the time played video games didnt think she and i connected she

of 15 then met her again when she was 17 i out of the fucked up need to want to be wanted by the only person i actually had confused feelings for manipulated or talked or we my cousin into an incestuous relationship i wanted to kill myself i kicked her out of the apt she moved in with my older brother and had a sexual relationship with him for about 3 years i felt i was the one that fucked

no confusion i have a full blown crush as an adult shes nothing special to look at not ugly in any way but my god the personality her choice in music so many things in common thinking about her makes me smile she initiated the flirting we chatted for hours and hours for weeks this did not happen over night she has been there for 7 months at this point and about 2 attached at my hip when she had free time also the subjects she would bring up she was very much flirting so of course i tell her no way can i have any regrets x200b so today i come into work and she makes no eye contact and shuts her office door witch is not normal i ask her if i can talk to her about something later at lunch we get ice cream some times together so i figured that would be the time she just avoided and left me standing there after i asked if we could talk later didnt answer so i asked her at the end of the day told her how i felt and the last thing that i wanted was for her to feel weird at work then she told me she has some one and its complicated i am almost positive she likes another coworker i see them text each other all the time didnt think anything of it till today the thing is yesterday i mentioned i might ask her out the next day joking around when i seen the other co worker in the parking lot the one i think she likes he doesnt work in the building with us hadnt seen or talked to him at all today he laughed when he seen me today at the end of the day when we clocked out pretty sure he told her the day before it made so much sense after i thought about it the way she avoided me x200b she wants nothing to do with me went from conversations her staring at me when she thought i wasnt looking to her actively avoiding me at work in just one day i went from feeling again i went from finally feeling like i can open up to someone i even entertained being normal once i felt again for someone else once more this time it wasnt misplaced i told myself i should have listened to myself when i told me not to even think like that because it wont happen it wont never in my life will i ever find someone that wants me for me not to use me never in my life will i want the person that does i will not be happy all i want for my coworker is to be happy i dont think in any way that anything on both parts was malicious i think its just terrible timing or this is hell x200b i think im done thinking about headed to sleep i will check tomorrow to see what people have to say if anything all i know is i got to feel for once and what i felt was what people do normally i couldnt even once in my life have one thing one fucking thing normal i cant be happy i guess fuck this world update i made it home from work while i was at work i felt comfortable enough to talk a little to a co worker gave him a little perspective and the day was less award than i thought it would be he helped just by listening that being said she still locked herself in her office all day so there was at least not to much awkwardness didnt have lunch with everyone witch is very unusual for me and left a little early so we didnt have to leave together i just want her to feel comfortable at work its not her fault at all also everyone at work knows everyone including both my bosses thought the same as i did about my coworkers interest in me one even asked the girl i liked i guess how long do you think it will take before you two hook up so i guess my mind wasnt playing tricks on me just wish she didnt play games all i know is i cant choose how i feel and i bet shes no different so i am just going to be myself for right now do what i do dont think just do but fuck im still so fucking tired of being nothing feeling nothing at least today i felt like shit i mean that at least is something another thing i will add is my older brother and i have different fathers and my cousin is not a blood relative of his,pre-pandemic

sorry if this question might be offensive in any way i hope its not but i started drinking a few months ago because of catastrophical life situation and i thought most drunks went that way because of similar reasons yet i see some people here having stories of their lives being perfect before starting with spouses houses kids white fences the whole nine yards but then they started chugging bottles of whiskey all day every day and it all went down the drain is it some biologicalchemical craving how does it feel i ask for in my case its strictly psychological i dont get cravings for ethanol as a substance just the cravings for being intoxicated i dont even like the taste and had no ethanol cravings when i had other equivalents,post-pandemic
hey again ive been part of this community for the past few months now and ive definitely had my ups and downs when it comes to health anxiety for the past few months its been the fear of breast cancer for me 21 years old and male go do the math on that one despite numerous tests and reassurances from doctors but there was something ive always noticed when browsing this sub and im pretty sure a lot of you have had the same experience id scroll down the sub looking for people with similar fears and similar symptoms hoping to find someone who can provide some form of reassurance however as id scroll id see other people having their own issues either related or not related to my own and id always have the same exact thought when looking at them oh they cant possibly be sick im the one with the illness or their anxiety is just causing their symptoms but my symptoms are real and im pretty sure a lot of you had thought the same exact thing we always think were the exception the 0000001 the unlucky ones but i want you to ask yourself something why why do you think like that why are you the medical anomaly i asked myself the same question and genuinely i couldnt come up with a decent answer but thats what health anxiety does it isolates you it makes you feel as if youre alone when youre not because chances are about a million people out there are also worried about the same symptoms you are and how many of those people do you genuinely think are really sick so again ask yourself why do you think youre the exception why are you somehow the unluckiest person in the world that you have every illness known to man,pre-pandemic
ive been trying to get sober for almost a year now the most time ive had was a couple weeks i feel like i cant change without a complete life change starting the process to possibly go into rehab and just feel like im in limbo ive tried aa other programs online etc i dont know why im posting i just feel so hopeless,post-pandemic
i was diagnosed with adhd when i was 10 over 14 years ago i remember when the doctor told my mom i would very likely heavily underperform academically i remember my mom tearing up when we left the doctors office i can so vividly recall what i thought at that moment nobody makes my mama cry i dont know what this adhd thingy is but i will beat the shit out of it and so my war against it started the next week consisted of me trying to get all the information i could about adhd online it was very hard as every single thing i read i could relate to this is me this is how i always act i do really have this adhd thingy i wanted to deny it so badly my parents are the best they got me started in the medication very early on went to a shrink until i was 15 which helped me a lot even though my parents were very understanding they never let adhd be an excuse for my fuck ups which might sound harsh but it just went very well with my fight it mentality for the next couple years i tried to do all the things that adhd would make hard to do and realized that i could not win on all fronts so i decided to focus on an specific aspect of adhd to fight the academic underperformance and so i tried to get the best scores make friends with the smartest people at school etc getting good marks made me feel validated and even more importantly it made me feel that even though i was handicapped i could do better than normal people if i tried hard enough fast foward 5 years i was 17 and got the 3rd best scores in the whole school it felt so good it feels so good to prove people wrong still something very important that i learned during those years is that you cant really win against adhd it never goes away the best you can do is accept it live with it control it i could keep babbling about myself but what i am trying to convey is that what worked for me was 1 i saw adhd as a challenge not an excuse i could hide behind not as reason as to why people should pity me as i am not a victim 2 no one should ever expect less of me because i have adhd it doesnt define me it doesnt control me the older i got the more i tired to not let people know i had adhd as that would give me a excuse to hide behind in case i fucked up 3 do not deny medication it exists for a reason it helps however dont be overly dependent on it the more situations you can handle without medication the more you will learn to control it 4 you are gonna fuck up you are gonna be annoying sometimes some people are gonna be rude to you as most people have no obligation not patience to deal with us when we go into overdrive the more you understand that less offended you will feel when they tell you to chill out some stuff is gonna be tough but you gotta love yourself if you dont then work hard to be a person you can love a person you can be proud about pd english is not my native language so please let me know if i got anything wrong good riddance everyone d,pre-pandemic
and it feels great i was a poly substance abuser i abused the most heavily oxycodone firstly then benzos and molly followed by adderall and marijuana and cocaine followed by anything else i could get my hands on ive smoked meth ive smoked crack and ive smoked and sniffed heroin all besides meth which ive done a couple times only once it feels so great to have a clear head to be motivated at work to be able to spend my money on things i want and to actually have a large amount of money saved up already when i was using the first day i got my check it was gone i was already fronting pills from dealers that day with next weeks pay check my mom got sick of my shit and kicked me out i was living in a dirty house where about 2030 people lived and it was a small house the shower reeked so i never showered never brushed my teeth never ate i was 19 at 95 pounds when i overdosed on oxycodone 30mg countless xanax and countless ativan the police said it took so many doses of narcan to revive me i was lucky to be alive and my parents came to see me they loved me they missed me but i was pissed that i was sober they discharged me from the hospital and my parents had my clothes i told my parents that i was going to walk in the rain in a hospital gown to my friends house which i did to get more ativan and more oxy immediately after i overdosed instead of coming home with them looking back i wish i chose to go back home with them but i had hit rock bottom within a few days i told my mom i wanted to come home and i wanted to get clean and i wanted to go to rehab i wanted a new life i almost have enough to put down for a new car now life is great i lost some friends but i kept the true ones and thats the realest shit youll find out if youre thinking about getting clean short term solutions are never the answer to a long term problem i see a psychiatrist now for anxiety medications unabuseable i take an unabuseable form of adhd medication i dont abuse any of my medications or mistake any of them the only thing i need to improve on now that im sober is getting a better job going back to school once i get a car and eating better my eating habits are not the best like ice cream sandwiches when i wake up but yk what i used to smoke heroin off aluminum foil and sniff pills so i think were doing better,pre-pandemic
im not a doctor so only read further if youve been checked out by your doctor and told youre healthy a bit of backstory ive had heart palpitations on and off since 2015 they began a few months before i had to move countries on my own for university and leave everything and everyone behind for my palpitations they always felt more like a sinking feeling i could best describe it as when youre in one of those slow moving elevators and its the feeling you get in your stomachchest when the elevator stops agonisingly slowly i know very specific when a plane first lifts off and you can feel it in your whole body that youre suddenly no longer touching the ground when something jumps in front of you and your heart sinks in your stomach so you can guess i had a fun time explaining the above feelings to not one or two doctors the looks ive got were amazing after being checked by multiple doctors in two countries they never ever found anything blood tests ambulance called ekg more recently an xray pretty sure the only thing i havent had was a 24hour heart monitor because as im 22 and doctors never found anything no one was concerned enough to set me up with one my mom always calms me down with one doctor could be mistaken but 7 cant all make the same mistake so you just gotta trust them a few months ago i had a full week of palpitations seven days exactly and they stopped just as sudden as they started one day i was fine the other day i was having a palpitation every few minutes and in seven days they stopped i went to the emergency room as i was having a palpitation literally every 45 minutes sometimes more and a few things happened at the emergency 1 i had a palpitation while connected to a heart monitor 2 the doctor could not see it when checking the printout version of my heart rhythm not sure of the proper naming of it but its that long piece of paper with your heart rhythm on it i was amazed how could i have a palpitation and for it to not be visible as it turns out women can have palpitations based on hormone activity that are considered so tiny and so normal that are basically not detected by heart monitors but if the woman is highly sensitive or suffering from health anxiety shes more prone to feeling it imagine feeling a palpitation when even ecg cannot recognise it as such so i just wanted to share some things and possibly help 1 heart palpitations in women can very often be a hormone change such as period ovulation or sometimes as simple as pms 2 as everyone has said before caffeine is a big no if youre suffering from palpitations but also chocolate and foods high in sugar if im having palpitations and ive been eating too much sugar i take it as my body saying stop it now 3 w a t e r i cannot possibly stress it enough the amount of palpitations ive had that were solely because i was dehydrated i always carry a water bottle with me now and when im experiencing palpitations i drink even more than usual because it makes not only my heart but my body work better 4 being too hot can also cause palpitations after a hot shower or wearing too much clothes 5 the vagus nerve its a nerve connecting your stomach and your brain that passes right next to the heart and can cause palpitations if the stomach is dealing with overeating too heavy food too spicy etc this video explains it in detail 6 and most importantly if it causes you panic its not a heart attack ive spoken with quite a few people that has survived heart attacks and they all said the same they were not panicking when it happened they were worried but their bodies literally could not panic as it was a life and death situation and they had to be sane enough to reach for help and survive so if you panic its just a sign its safe and youll be fine hope all of this helps at least a bit youre not alone and its gonna be okay edit thank you for the gold im fairly new here so im not sure what exactly does it mean but it must be good haha i forgot to mention one more additional reason behind palpitations so im including it above,pre-pandemic

so to start off i get times where im so lonely and i think that no one good will enter my life its pretty much to the point where i just hate myself whenever it pops into my head which is pretty fucking often i live by myself which i know doesnt help im trying to get myself out there and meet new people but its not working there are times where i just want someone to hold me or have some sort of physical affection i dont even really have a life outside of work time just kinda passes and then im back at work which isnt great either sorry if this is too much but i just wanted to get this off my chest,post-pandemic
growing up i had a really tough time being alone whenever i wasnt around people i felt extremely isolating and lonely i started dating my now husband in high school and so i spent a lot of time with him but when hed go away or be gone for any periods i felt that loneliness again and really struggled but figured it was just me being young and in love through my late teens and up until 2223 i loved going out with friends going to events being around other people i could spend hours around people and never have a problem once i hit 2425 i dont want to be around anyone except my husband and my parents after an hour of being around anyone even my friends im exhausted i work in an industry where i have to do events every now and again and i just cannot handle being around so many people im constantly bailing on plans with people because i cant bring myself to go i feel awful cancelling last minute and feel like a flake but i genuinely would rather do anything else it sucks because i do love being around people but its just too exhausting when i do events it drains me so much that i need to be alone for a day or two after i know this sounds like im just depressed but ive struggled with depression for years and have been at much lower points and still never experienced this i talked to my husband about it recently saying how i didnt like this feeling and felt bad about bailing on plans with friends and trying to get out of commitments because of it and he just keeps saying theres nothing wrong with it and that maybe ive realized how important my alone time is i dont know but im really curious to know if anyone else has gone through this and did it pass,post-pandemic
hi has anyone checked themselves into a psych ward for treatment for bpd if so did it help or make things worse i have been looking at all my options for treatment the meds are only just taking the edge off my anxiety is so bad that i am struggling to ask for help and i can see myself slipping downhill i have been thinking about getting help from the hospital but i am scared it will make things worse just wondering if anyone has been through the same thought process and actually been for treatment at a hospital i got my official diagnosis last year and i dont think its properly hit me yet its been an uphill battle but i can admit it has made me feel better having the official diagnosis and not being fobbed off my gps telling me i just need medication and cbt my problem is i dont really know how to process it and control my emotions and symptoms its really getting to me and i dont know what do to please any help or advice would be greatly appreciated god bless,post-pandemic

i dont even know how to put all of my thoughts down properly here ive been having terrible emotional breakdowns lately and i have no idea if talking about it will even help all of the problems in my life are directly tied to a condition i was born with and how ive been treated because of it based on what i know when i was born my biological sex was ambiguous and doctors tried to have me surgically corrected into a female my parents have denied knowing anything about it but they refuse to let me have access to my medical records even though im an adult the only reasons i have information about it are because of scars genital pain and hormone internal ultrasound testing from my gyno nothing about my body is sexually correct i have breasts but i have male pattern chest hair and pubic hair i have what should be a vagina but its actually just a small hole so narrow that i cant even use a tampon much less have sex with it i was born with a phallus but they shaved it down until it was the appropriate size to be a clitoris it hurts a lot now even as an adult its like a terrible stinging sensation that gets so bad sometimes that its brought me to tears before i cant even touch the left side of it because it stings and burns so badly ive always known that something was wrong about my body even as a kid i knew that certain things werent right and that i didnt feel the way that other girls did my parents refused to acknowledge it and hid everything from me my parents were very rigid about gender roles when i was growing up and they punished me whenever i didnt behave like my forcibly assigned sex most of my earliest memories are of me crying because i was forced to wear dresses makeup and necklaces i vividly remember begging my mom not to pierce my ears and spending my whole childhood wishing my ears would close up again because wearing earrings made me feel deeply sick when i got older it just got worse my parents wouldnt let me have hobbies or join clubs that they thought werent for my gender they stopped me from doing even simple things like learning to play the trumpet they refused to ever let me cut my hair above shoulder length and would only let me wear clothes that were girl colors if i did anything that deviated from what they wanted they would scream at me and call me a faggot or a dyke even now as an adult living in their house they do this and theyve said physically threatening things like youre not too old for us to spank you when i turned 18 i started having serious medical problems i ended up with an exceedingly rare kidney disorder from a hormone imbalance that came from the surgeries i was forced to have as a baby i nearly died from it that winter but still my parents told me nothing about my medical history i didnt get diagnosed until i was 20 when my pain was getting so horrific that i had to quit school and my job i went for my first visit to a gyno and she told me that i was abnormal i felt like a complete idiot when she told me my parents had always pulled me out of sex ed in school and i was raised in such a strict religious environment that i sincerely had never seen what anatomy was supposed to look like and i felt so broken and stupid then i was so scared of what would happen that i didnt tell my parents anything that my doctor told me i had been dating my boyfriend for years already and i was so scared to tell him that i waited months before i said anything to him either i just feel like such a failure i was never even remotely happy as a woman but i know that my family my boyfriend and everyone else could never accept me as a man either and ive never felt like a man in the first place ive always felt like i was something between that even as far back as i can remember but i know that people could never understand that even someone as loving patient and kind as my boyfriend cant fully understand how deeply this hurts me i feel so completely alone in the world i feel mutilated i feel like a disappointment to my family because i can never be what they wanted physically or emotionally i cant take the pain anymore either im constantly peeing blood and my kidney feels like a knife in my back ive been suffering from depression and dysphoria since early childhood and years of therapy havent helped me i just want it to end no more talk from my parents about how my entire existence is a sin no more feeling like im a horrible mistake and no more feeling like its going to destroy my relationship and hurt the only person who ever truly loved me i wish there were a way to fix this i wish my parents had left my body alone and raised me in a way where i could have been myself but now i feel so lost and alone that i dont even know who or what i am,pre-pandemic

so for the past couple months i f21 have been struggling with betrayal trauma that followed the end of my last relationship to spare everyone the bloody details the most important context is that we went through a lot of shit together he was my first love and the ultimate demise of our relationship was a horrifying experience to live through its been a few months since this happened and ive been able to cope relatively well considering the circumstances my problem however is that within the span of our relationship he had manipulated me multiple times into physical intimacy as well as used intimacy as a way to get me to trust him theres just a lot of heavy emotional ties there with me especially because he was also my first there were also some occasions that i think textbookwise are defined as assault but they were all more grey area than red imo so take that as you will its been months ive done a good job overcoming the worst of it but the one thing that i cannot shake are these incredibly graphic memories of our sexual experiences flashing in front of my eyes i cant do anything even by myself without them blinding my vision if anyone else has experienced this how do you cope i cant even think about doing anything physical without feeling utterly violated its a sickness that literally eats into my stomach and the goddamn folds of my brain im terrified that he broke that part of me i dont even know where to begin to get over this any advice is welcome anyway to those who did thanks for sticking out this tough read,post-pandemic

say the medication isnt a high enough dose to fully stabilise your mood in theory it would be able to stop extremes if its enough yes therefore could you possibly still have a manichypomanic episode just as you would but minus the crazy ie self destruction and hypersexuality not just psychosis for bipolar 1 upon starting abilify i feel it triggered a hypomanic episode im bipolar 2 however i wasnt aware because my usual tell tale signs are dangerous hypersexuality and other self destructive behaviours i had none of this not even an increased sex drive but i had the productivity and inability to keep still an irritability and i was unable to sleep at all i had a hypomanic episode without all the typical mania and i realised when i started sleeping again and was talking to my friend about how the last two weeks ive felt different and had insomnia 2 weeks always being my hypomanic window can abilify trigger mania too just trying to see what to tell my doctor,post-pandemic
one of the most psychologically damaging things you can tell a child especially a developing child is that they have a disorder theres something wrong with you is what your essentially saying this way you have felt your whole life that has been perfectly fine until now that you can not die from is not contagious does not effect iq or socializing skills is a disorder what a sham a lie and no word is responsible for the generations of intellectual belittlement more than disorder this is worse in my opinion than a bully who is simply bigger than another student most physical bullies are simply praying on the lower self esteems the best way to create low self images is to tell said person that they have a disorder thus the mental bully assists the physical bully ally oop this is disturbing the persons image of themselves for the rest of their lives getting beat up one time in grade 7 may have sucked disorder convinces people with statistically higher iqs that there stupid for the rest of their lives that is bullying we all on this feed have attention issues or hyperactivity there is nothing wrong with that being and seeing this differently is a gift dont sit still dont fit in to the box ask questions about the things you care about the things you care about are what you will love and what you love is where your attention is perfect,pre-pandemic

its like being a narcissist but at the same time being an empath its like being dr jekyll and mr hide but remembering everything being both at once yet sometimes only one at a time i can both love deeply and do horrible things to that person and i feel it all the guilt the desire to do good to the person i love the fear i feel crazy and i guess i am but at what point do you throw your arms in the air and give up say ok you know what im a horrible fuck up and im not worthy of anything good and ill never change so i guess ill stay here,pre-pandemic

note correct me if any of this is wrong i want to learn everything i have heard and seen about adhd i and alot of other people with autism also deal with on a daily basis i have autism and i also find it difficult to concentate and can get really hyper i also have crippling sensory issues and social issues people with adhd however seem to be able to take medication and most of their problems either go away or are atleast easier to deal with people with autism have no medication we have no reprieve so it would make sense to say its harder to deal with socially autistic people are more likely to be ostracised whereas most of people with adhd ive met thrive in social situations and even sometimes join the nts in bullying those with autism yes i am aware that both of these are a spectrum and people with more severe adhd will have it harder than p eople with autism that have lower support needs it is very frustrating to hear autism and adhd lumped together like its the same disability to me it just seems like everything people with adhd struggle with ppl with autism have and then more that cant go away even a little but with medication also adhd can be very misunderstood but comes with very little stigma whereas autism has so much stigma that parents wont tell their child about there disability or abuse them for it friends will avoid you because of it hell the entire world seems to hate you because of it i know there isnt necessarily a point to comparing these disabilities but im so sick of people downplaying autistic peoples struggles i have posted this on radhd so i can learn if i am wrong if i am wrong im sorry,post-pandemic
if you want to recognise an occasion please do so by offering extra support to those whove asked for it and by being a good citizen of the community mindful of our tips and guidelines edit in response to multiple requests im adding a definition of activism here campaigning to bring about political or social change thats straight out of the oed we arent making any special interpretation of it any post that is primarily about raising awareness or changing perceptions is activism according to the dictionary definition and thus a violation of the community rules some examples of the most common types of activists posts we were here all of which are totally inappropriate advocating for changes in laws around suicide advocating for change in the mentalhealth system advocating for changes in cultural norms or common perceptions around mentalhealth these are often related to specific days devoted to specific causes eg world suicide prevention day keep in mind that our mission here is individual peer support any post thats not a request for personal support regarding current experience related to suicide is probably a rule violation unless it has the mod approved flair,pre-pandemic

hello all this post is long over due and a long one but the sun is shining out today it is a beautiful day and i feel like theres not enough of these kind of posts on this subreddit so i thought i would like to share my story and maybe inspire and motivate others health anxiety has knocked me down more times then i can count numerous panic attacks fear of heart attacks fear of als fear of ms fear of cancer and i am so thankful for this group as i am not alone and i will continue to fight this type of anxiety day in and day out and i believe you guys can be able to fight it too as we are tougher and stronger then health anxiety i can go ahead and tell my whole story from when all this first started at 20 years old probably but i will only tell my story from this past year ever since july of 2019 i have been on edge as i believed i either had a brain tumour or ms my grandpa had ms so i was worrying that i might have gotten it my symptoms started as migraine with aura each episode lasting 30 mins and happening 5 times in the span of a week and a half julyaugust and this symptom hasnt happened since but was still worrisome at the time bugs crawling on skin sensation julypresent headaches july still get them from time to time right arm numbness julyoctober on and off right leg numbness septembernovemberish right pinky finger getting a cold sensation octoberpresent on and off sexual problems this doesnt happen all the time but has been a problem every once in a while for past 3 years i have chalked it up to just being a nervous nelly and anxietystress frequent urination have always kind of been one to go to the washroom quite a bit i also drink lots of water though brain fog julypresent on and off body wide twitching december 2018present finger tremors only really happens after a night of drinking left leg tremors probably just normal double vision augustpresent i have been told i have astigmatism though ghosting most likely due to astigmatism seeing whitesilver dots this probably is the scariest now that i think about it cuz i dunno why i get them in my vision from time to time only last about half a second cob webs in vision probably just from aging who knows left eye pain julynovember on and off usually after lifting heavy weight in gym but i thought for months this was optic neuritis a prevalent symptom of ms scotomas in vision when looking at the sky augustpresent about the same time as the migraines started dizzynessaugustdecember on and off the list goes on but you get the picture the above are majority of symptoms that fit the ms criteria to say the least this past year has been a living hell for me and has turned a lot of good days into brutally awful days i thought there was going to be no hope for me on numerous occasions i thought the possibility of ms was going to be a real reality for me that i would have to give up the career i was pursuing which requires me to be healthy and do something else with my life the possibility of what will my significant other think what if my quality of life is effected etc etc so many of these thoughts inside my head consumed me day in and day out after the migraine symptoms and losing my vision temporarily and having a numb right arm after i decided to take action saw family doctor about issues late august saw family doctor two weeks later as symptoms werent getting better family doctor going to refer me to a neurologist late october get in to see neurologist neurologist refers me for mri jan 13 mri appointment jan 25 results are back but have to wait until feb 13 to see neurologist i think this time period was the worst anxiety wise feb 13 neurologist appointment feb 13 the day has finally arrived this is the day that is going to change my life forever the day i receive my diagnosis of ms i thought all was over i sit down in my neurologists office he starts talking as if hes going to give me some bad news and then he says it appears there was no indication of demyelination diseases in your mri scan demyelination disease is ms and it came back normal i was so relieved i started crying in tears of joy as soon as i left the neurologists i felt like i have just been rejuvenated like i have been given a second chance i felt so much weight slip off both of my shoulders and i immediately felt like the sky is still the limit for myself going forward it is still surreal to this day and i am so thankful without a doubt i know i will still be battling this terrible hypochondriasm going forward as i know for a fact that it is not that easy to just get over i will be seeking therapy in the near future and doing everything i can to be the best version of myself day in and day out i will keep fighting and i believe you guys will keep fighting as well and i am here for you i just wanted to tell my story to maybe give hope to others and to show that many of my symptoms that i had were all caused by anxiety and stress and that the brain is a very powerful organ that is capable of causing symptoms like that i made a post earlier leading up to the neurologist appointment and there were a few of you that wanted to know how it went so hopefully you come across this post and thank you to everyone who took the time to read this it was a long one keep fighting the good fight you are not alone,pre-pandemic

coming here wondering if anyone has had any similar experiences ive noticed fairly consistently that the only people i find myself interested in i tend to develop an extreme devotion and almost obsession with before we become anything serious or even anything at all it becomes incredibly frustrating to have a person who youre interested in never be a little piece of your life but rather your whole world every action means something every time they spend too long to replythey sound different it means something it gets so exhausting but also incredibly annoying i hate that my world revolves around a person who could never be as infatuated with me as i am with them and my reactions to these things have never been minor ive had countless uncontrollable breakdowns from things people have donehavent done over such minor things and above anything it feels humiliating i know i get fairly clingy early on with a fp and it often throws them off or scares them away but it often feels as if i cant help it i desire so badly to find someone who feels the way i do i hope im not alone and maybe there are others who have had similar experiences,post-pandemic

hi i am a sufferer with health anxiety and i am wondering if it is worth the money to invest in a private scan to soothe my anxiety i live in the uk and the waiting lists for scans ultrasounds mris cts etc are incredibly long i believe that going private would soothe my anxiety as i know id be able to get the results quick however has anyone ever used private healthcare before to help with their health anxiety for example getting quick reassurance or getting scan results quick and is it worth paying the high amounts of money to get this healthcare,post-pandemic
as someone who has and continues to find wellness only after rejecting psychiatry what can you tell me about wellness from psych meds for me the medications did nothing to dull or tamp down the voices and visions i only became well after going off them i see the sentiment to encourage others to take them around plenty but little discussion of this experience can you tell me your story do you get noticeable results minutes after taking a pill how do they work what does them kicking in feel like i tried this route and found better results another way what can you tell me about your path and experience,post-pandemic

for context i was diagnosed with adhd as a child but i was doing really well in school up until 8th grade i am 14 right now and am in 8th grade all i know is that whenever i see an adhd post i instantly relate and i think i may be in the early stages of depression as my adhd and inability to perform longterm tasks and tasks that require lots of focus are causing my depression and depressive episodes which in turn exasperate my adhd even more then my adhd worsens the depression and then its an infinite loophole simply put i probably have depression because i cant focus on tasks that will actually give me stability in life then the depression and the adhd worsen each other i also have racing thoughts and overthink a lot in fact youll probably see that i overthink a lot just by looking at the way i type and structure sentences as i always write really long sentences since i have overcomplicated thought patterns overthinking causes my anxiety the anxiety mainly kicks in when im playing basketball on my school or aau team and it causes me to overthink and doubt my abilities im 100 sure i would start on my middle school team if i didnt have anxiety and adhd and if i could just focus im writing this post in an attempt to see what could be the main underlying problem for this and to also help others who are in similar situations,post-pandemic

smoking marijuana makes me manichypomanic not sure which is appropriate i love the periods of mania as music feels amazing i feel spiritual and alive im happy motivated and sociable but i wonder if my current depression is caused by the previous maniahypomania with tolerance after about six months i didnt get much of an effect from weed anymore and then winter came and it felt like an episode of seasonal depression which i am still dealing with today i guess because the depression didnt happen as soon as i stopped getting strong effects from weed and it happened when the days became very short and dark i am not sure if the depression was caused by the manic episode or not what id like to know is if anyone else becomes manic or hypomanic from weed and most importantly if they have a depressive episode after it if so is it every time i feel so good and happy when im manic with little negative consequences i dont destroy my life and relationships that its so hard for me to think that i might have to say goodbye to those feelings for ever but i might just have to i dont know if its worth the depression it doesnt help that i have barely enjoyed music for years now when i used to be a huge music fan it guts me would love to know about similar experiences,post-pandemic
hi all the title pretty much says it all in my country usually your test results get uploaded before you talk to your doctor in my case this means an mri and 3 weeks later an appointment with the neurologist how do you guys cope with having early acces to your results im afraid if i might look i might misinterpret them and will end up spiraling even more i called the hospital and asked them to block me froms eeing the results but they told me they cant do you guys have any advise on this matter,post-pandemic
hi im looking for advice here as ive noticed adderall makes me really tired sometimes and isnt helping as much with my focus anymore and my psych said my tolerance to my medication might be increasing ive been on the same dose for about 4 months now but im already on the maximum dose according to my doctor 40mg daily has anyone experienced thiscan it be helped if i just stop my medication for a few days or a week and would the withdrawal really be that bad for reference i do have at least one day a week usually a weekend where i dont take it if im not working or doing school stuff i know medication affects everyone differently but i want to know what other people have experienced so i can prepare myself if i do decide to go on a break from my meds,post-pandemic

for anyone interested heres my story and a few thoughts on recovery in the last section of my sermon lol april 2014 after 14 months of recovery i relapsed after i steadily stopped going to as many meetings and focused more on work i had convinced myself it was mind over matter and within a week i was back to my old alcoholic way of drinking and it got worse from there back to the old endless thought of i can drink today and stop tomorrow on and on got very sick and really the only thing that gave me a window of opportunity to take action was how fast my tolerance went up how difficult it was to hold down alcohol food water anything and on may 26th somewhere in the midst of an 18 pack of coors of all things i had my last one may 27th 2014 was 5 years ago already and in that time ive turned all my old chips in worked the steps earned them all back and then some while still detoxing about a week after my sobriety date at 31 years of age i started a new journey in school summer session psychology 1 in community college i worked very hard in school i took no short cuts i sat up front and took notes i did well and i stayed sober the summer of year one was a hard one as my dear friend a girl i might have married had things turned out a little different michelle died due to organ failure caused by alcoholism at 36 years old i was able to be by her side that night at the hospital because i was sober may she rest in peace that week following i completed step 12 with my sponsor and i carried on in school a lot has happened since then i got to prove to myself that i wasnt that f student high school drop out anymore over the years to come and i stayed sober a day at a time in that time i earned two associate degrees one even in alcohol and drug studies if you can believe that which i think is hilarious i transferred to my top choice 4 year university and studied there and then i graduated with a bachelors in psychology last year my father was diagnosed with advanced lung cancer from smoking last year not long before i graduated and he got to be there at that ceremony it meant the world to both of us i think and my mom too even my sponsor was there i sat right next to another member of this very fellowship at that commencement we took classes together from community college through university and we both graduated that day summa cum laude not bad for a couple of alcoholics now shes in a masters of marriage and family therapy program at her top choice grad school and im in a master of social work program at my top choice grad school at an internationally recognized tier 1 research university with one year left to go i am pursuing my dreams and a future that i never could have had had i not been an alcoholic and worked the steps of this recovery program i love the life recovery has given me today and i intend to make the most of it i just hope that maybe you or maybe someone new can read my story and find some hope because when i came in i never thought id be a person to take a birthday chip someday actually i thought you were all a bunch of religious weirdos in a cult and thankfully i was wrong and it took me really learning about the program to get it and accept it i wouldnt change anything about my life im grateful for all of it today early recovery is hard and the life that precedes recovery is often so sad its no wonder many of us were willing to consider suicide to escape i have come to believe that we have a potential of sorts a source of energy a kind of growing capacity generated in the void of the emptiness that is life in addiction it is the inverse of recovery like the dark side of the moon but i believe it conceals something very powerful we cannot see it is there all along if we can only reach that fork in the road to access the moment of clarity and take the path that is right there for us my journey since then i swear every door opened and a stone appeared before each step of the of the way on this path for many of us we must reach the end to find a beginning its beautiful and almost sort of hard to believe how these things are true about life but they are thanks to everyone here who has been supportive over these years you are family to me and i love you guys theres no people on earth who have the depth heart and humor of all of you and i plan to stick around for more to come one day at a time,pre-pandemic

im 15 and ive been speaking with my therapist she was really sweet and tried the best she could however these sessions werent working i need higher help shes spoken with my dad on many occasions about referrals things to do and stuff like that and my dad hasnt really done what shes asked or found another therapist or helped me with my possibly autismadhd testing so now shes ended services as there isnt much more she can do im sad and a bit upset at my dad he always says hes too busy with work and stuff like that and trust me i understand parents especially single ones arent machines but come on i need help i havent gone to school basically all year because i cant stand being there due to having trauma from bullying and hoping the people i trusted would help me i cant be alone in that place plus i have issues focusing and dont feel like getting bullied or annoyedness from teachers thinking im just not trying plus my stimming can be rather obvious especially when im upset or getting fustrated with a school assignment and i dont wanna be bullied or stared at or disrupt the class i just cant get people to take me seriously,post-pandemic
when i see people trivializing mental disorders it makes my blood boil especially when it is adhd because it hits so close to home nobody not even my parents could ever understand what is wrong with me i was a bright boy but i simply could not focus for the life of me and it made me feel so bad about myself because i truly wanted more from my life i remember when i asked people for advice about should i take medications to treat my adhd everyone would keep telling me not to do it how those drugs are going to fry my brain and il end up a meth addict or crazy and how when they have trouble doing something they just breathe or play some music or go for a walk and rest and for a long time i really tried doing everything but i failed 2 years in university and that was the final straw i told myself i might become insane or fry my brain completely by the time im 40 but i would rather live 10 years in control than live a 100 being nothing more than just an observer in my life ive been on adderall for 2 years now and only after taking it have i realized just how much i have suffered because of my disease it took me so long to be able to forgive myself for all my failiures i even became a much better driver before i could not focus on anything and it took me so long to get my drivers licence and my instructor would always complain that i dont focus and i always felt bad and stupid i am a much safer driver now tldr adhd is absolutely lifedestroying disease and i wonder just how many doctors and engineers the wold has lost because their potential was cut due to adhd,pre-pandemic

i dont even know if i am using the correct terminology but in social situations i frequently shut down to some degree i cannot really say something meaningful anymore i cant really think anymore it happens when someone touches upon an unexpected subject or touches my self image which is negative for example someone might ask what i do for hobbies i dont have any im sure people will find that strange and cant really respond it can happen with new people or even friends it is probably related to the freeze response but having read about that my reponse is definitely no that serious it is probably fairly normal with social anxiety my question i really hate myself when this has happened it has cost me dates social opportunities etc because i come across as awkward how can i prevent this from happening all resources i found is how to deal with freeze response when it happens but not about preventing that it happens does anyone recognise what i am describing and is there a way to prevent it,post-pandemic
this doesnt seem to be common knowledge and i get that recreational drug use is illegal so your doctor is more likely to tell you never take ibuprofen than never take lsd when you receive your lithium prescription your doctor probably even tells you to never touch recreational drugs being a bipolar patient and all but were stubborn people who sometimes do impulsive shit while hypomanic never take lsd if you are on lithium you highly risk seizures andor psychotic breaks there are various accounts on erowid about this drug combination of the 9 reports where lithium was combined with lsd 6 users experienced seizures the remaining 3 users painted a very negative experience all including psychotic symptoms and extreme hallucinations with one user also experiencing repeated loss of consciousness i quote from the account of pufferfish who took one hit of lsd while taking just 90mg of lithium daily i started acting strange to the point where the sober ones there were worried and then started to convulse and stop breathing my face turned bright blue before my friend got me to start breathing again the paramedics came but couldnt keep me in one place so police cars showed up to help they strapped me down and put me in the ambulance x200b bonus harm reduction info using recreational drugs will have a negative effect on your stability but if you still plan to take drugs practice harm reduction methods i personally recommend 1 check psychonautwiki before taking any type of recreational drugs every single time even if you took it before double check your dosage the duration the interactions 2 always reagent test never blindly trust dealers how to test kit vendors available on rreagenttesting sometimes nbome is sold as lsd while fatal on high dosages unlike lsd 3 use milligram scales or volumetric dosing when choosing your dosage scoops and eyeballing lines are highly inaccurate methods 4 allergy test i once had an allergic reaction to a drug i had used before from the same bag as three friends of mine who were having a great time on it that scared the living shit out of me so now i make it a point to spread this information that youve used a substance before and that others are fine while using from the same batch doesnt mean you cannot be harmed x200b stay safe everyone 3,pre-pandemic

i just got into a relationship a little bit ago after not being in one for years even before we started dating i always had problems with sex ive had multiple sexual assaults as a teenager and have diagnosed ptsd from it yesterday it was valentines day and i was genuinely looking forward to hopefully being able to enjoy intimacy it was all fine until the penetration part its only during penetration my mind immediately became flooded with emotions and i couldnt stop myself from crying he stopped the second he noticed and told me that it was okay and we didnt need to do this i was straight shaking and sobbing not only because of the flashbacks but because i dont know how to make it stop im so tired of having this happen every time it all just feels so hopeless i dont know if ill ever be able to enjoy it it makes me want to leave and run away so i dont have to feel embarrassed or like im a burden even if he doesnt think i am has anyone gotten past this point before,post-pandemic

she called it the rule of 3s basically make a list of safe foods ie foods you general dont binge on and feel safe eating and a list of non safe foods ie foods you tend to binge on or dont feel comfortable eating next make a list of safe places aka places you dont generally binge like a restaurant or in public with your friends and non safe places like your room alone lastly make a list of safe times times youre less likely to binge for me its the morning or afternoon and non safe times times youre more likely to binge for me itd be evening or late at night from now on 23 of those things need to be safe whenever you eat anything not in a safe place if youre going to eat it has to be a safe food and at a safe time not eating a safe food you bet your ass you have to eat it in a safe place and at a safe time as long as 23 are safe challenge yourself with something not safe not only does this encourage eating nonsafe foods in a healthy way it really helps deflect a binge if you stick to it i hope this helps yall as much as its been helping me,pre-pandemic

i read and responded to a post on this topic yesterday and op from that post recommended that i make my comment a post of its own after all the times ive been helped by this community this finally feels like my opportunity to give back here goes cracks knuckles x200b so ive been struggling with this lately myself ive been wanting to learn the guitar for literally years but never had the money to buy one now that i have the money to do it i keep getting cold feet and thinking oh man i know im not gonna be able to stick with it so its not even worth buying but fck it im gonna buy it heres how i came to that decision x200b 1 be kind to yourself obviously 1 universal rule of adhd applicable to all scenarios selfloathing sucks do your best to be kind to yourself i recently came across the term selfcompassion which i really like be at least as nice to yourself as youd be to other people you wouldnt make fun ofbeat up a loved one who switches hobbies often so dont do it to yourself x200b 2 emphasize dynamic hobbies someone in yesterdays thread used the phrase dynamic hobbies and i think thats a god damn genius phrase we need hobbies that we can pick up for a month or two at a time and completely forget for another few months thats just how myour hobbies work we just need to accept that and choose compatible hobbies last month i got obsessed with freshwater aquariums watched a ton of youtube videos went to petco to scout potential fish etc even bought a fancy ass 100 fish tank from amazon then i realized that this is not a dynamic hobby forgettingnot caring about my aquarium for months will result in dead fish error 404 incompatible hobby fish tank was subsequently returned relatedly i had a plant in my bedroom that i needed to water every day or few days that plant is dead as hell i now have one of those plants that you only need to remember to water once a month snake plant if youre wondering plant is thriving lol as far as hobbies go guitar is super dynamic if i learn 3 songs this month and no songs for the next two months no one dies x200b 3 reset your expectations listen i know myself i am not about to practice diligently every day for the next year and be performing at local bars in 2 years thatd be great but its a pipe dream if i define that as the goal im going to fall short and feel shitty instead im going to focus on being able to strum a couple songs here and there when im bored and maybe learn one song for my girlfriend that i can use to score some romantic brownie points on a birthdayanniversary thats it anything else is icing on the cake if i do actually end up learning guitar for real awesome if i dont awesome the point here is to add something to my life that brings me joy and dammit strumming along to a song with 4 basic chords from time to time gives me joy dont squeeze all the joy out of it by putting too many expectations on it or on yourself x200b 4 reduce the barriers to exit specifically financially youve heard of barriers to entry well allow me to introduce you to a new concept barriers to exit super important recognize and accept that your new hobby crush may fade with time when i get excited about a new hobby i am super tempted to buy professionalgrade stuff mistake when entering a new hobby recognize that it may not last and make it as easy as possible to get out of financially meaning it wont be too much of a loss if when you give it up when starting a new hobby that requires purchasing things try to force yourself to only purchase entry level stuff until the hobby has stuck around for long enough to justify investing in or buy things that can easily be resold on the internet entry level dslr camera that can be resold if you decide you hate photography fine professional grade dlsr camera engraved with your first and last name and therefore with limited resale value not fine not fine at all this month i started a new workout class went to the first class and loved it was ready to purchase the 200 month unlimited monthly membership for 12 months yay then a little voice said hey man remember to reduce the barriers to exit you might not like this next month so instead i bought the 50 entrylevel package and will reevaluate my commitment as i go if it doesnt stick it wont nearly be as much of a loss x200b 5 dont try harder try differently also a foundational adhd rule but relevant in literally every scenarioincluding this one when it comes to a new hobby you may need to outsource your executive function to a teacher or class if you can afford it example ive had a regular gym membership for 6 months and literally only gone 1 single time its just too much to actually figure out what workouts i am supposed to be doing keep myself accountable to the time set for each exercise etc also tbh its honestly kind of boring i signed up for a workout class last week the only thing i need to do is show up they already have the exercises planned so i dont need to think about it and its a group class so theres constant motivation to push myself from peers i have exercised 5 times in the last 7 days thats like an infinity percent improvement from my previous strategy i would never have gotten there if i was just trying harder at a strategy that didnt work for me x200b 6 trying new hobbies is a hobby unto itself what is the definition of a hobby something you do for fun some people collect stamps for fun other people watch birds for fun others make scrapbooks you know what i do try new hobbies i get pleasure from getting excited about a random thing and diving into it a month at a time trying new hobbies is my hobby no sense in feeling guilt or shame about it when it makes me so god damn happy this is a subtle but really important reframing person x would say i collect stamps for fun last year i found a rare limited edition 1956 stamp from montana and a couple from california in the 1760s i loved it i would say i try new hobbies for fun last year i dabbled in photography guitar and dog sitting i loved it both of us would be having fun doing what we do person x would never feel bad about him or herself for not trying enough new things so why would i ever feel bad about trying too many new things x200b tldr be kind to yourself accept that your hobbies will have to be dynamic instead of trying harder consider trying differently reduce the financial barriers to exit and most importantly recognize that trying new hobbies is a hobby godspeed mateys happy hobbying edit1 several of you have appreciated the dynamic hobbies concept so i went back to track down exactly where i first heard it credit goes to ucarlulua d edit2 holy smokes silver and gold deep gratitude to all of you like i said above my greatest reward is feeling like ive given back to people whove given me so much 3 edit3 platinum1 i didnt even know that existed jokes aside to everyone thats expressed their thanks i want to thank you i spend some part of literally every single day hating how my brain works or doesnt and wondering whether ill ever have anything of value to offer the world today you all helped me feel like something i did was meaningful and that means more than i can say eternal love to you all,pre-pandemic

too familiar right i pull my car into the parking lot ive entered 50 100 more than 100 times im going to get another bottle but this ones gonna be the changer im going to wean myself off liquor this timehopefully i didnt want to go to the store but i need to have a supply to carry me through the weekend something that gets me through the social norms ill be expected to face by the end of this weekend i hope ill be drinking less but i expect this as i buy my supply i walk into the liquor store telling myself to treat it normally youre not a user to these employees not an addict to them your just a frequent customer who enjoys the same thing every week no ones judging you noticing you keeping track of youright i go towards to the liquor aisle i plan to buy my typical stuff from i could go to the liquor store 10 miles away that sells this bottle 3 cheaper but no im not gonna let myself also try to find savings for my problem i also look around for a minute as if i dont know exactly what im grabbing already i get to the register the woman working the register is probably worse off than i am i remember when she started here she looked 10 years younger than now and its only been a couple years i often wonder if she has addiction i hold the bottle while in line observing the ones around me an old man is using the atm before the register something about his movements tells me this is the most hell do all day the older lady at the register has an entire cart filled like its a freaking shopping trip but instead of wishing the cashier well and moving on shes completely silent as she finishes her transaction one that im caught off guard when she suddenly ends without a thank you or goodbye and just rolls off the cashier takes my purchase next no id asked for gosh am i familiarized around here or do i just look over 21 ugh i dont wanna know its so much easier when the cashier is someone i dont really ever see but she takes my money and despite my irrational fears she says nothing that would trigger or embarrass me i leave the store with a single handle in hand am i doing better than most or am i just not that bad yet these poor people giving whatever soul they have left into drinking hoping this time theyll get back to normal dont get me wrong ive had last trips that actually lasted but even when were sober we never can ignore the liquor store when we pass by it driving its a landmark a memory a reminder i can impel you to come back to me at any time were not done pulling into the store has always felt like a defeat i failed to avoid what i know isnt actually helping me but heres the thing it does work very momentarily and comes with even worse aftershocks but it works in the moment but later today tomorrow ill be even more depressed even more anxious why was i so impelled to buy more when i thought ive learned this lesson so many times tldr synopsis of a regular liquor store visit i write this in hopes of letting others know we have had the same mentality the same desires the same suffering there is no moral lesson here no clear cut answer just know youre not alone were all suffering from something bigger than alcohol addiction when you see someone in line at the liquor store who looks like a familiar sight sympathize let it empower you to know this isnt unique its very common youre not an anomaly youre a statistic youre not hopeless youre more empathetic and experienced than you could ever understand keep fighting and know im fighting with you,post-pandemic

hi there i 23f dont have ptsd but im 97 sure my friendpartner type person 26m does i have questions and i thought the best people to ask would be people who deal with it themselves let me start by saying he has not been diagnosed but he is in the military so they dont exactly prioritize mental health and he would know as he works in behavioral health based on the life experiences he has told me about i dont see how he couldnt be traumatized by it but heres the situation and you can tell me if im way off or not i wont go into gory details its not my story to tell tldr every year this week my friend ghosts and idk if its bc of trauma or not and idk what to do we did date in 2022 he was always open and honest about his experiences and trauma and talked about his feelings he was previously married and i think that she did a lot of damage ill spare specifics we talked about it if he wanted to but i never pressed him for more details than he wanted to give he dealt with a lot of depression that got significantly worse during the winter we broke up last february he said he just couldnt focus on any more than himself we went no contact for 8 months and started talking again in september this time we didnt go right back to dating and stayed in this weird morethanfriends limbo thing he said he was doing better mentally and i did see an improvement until winter came i finally noticed that he has cycles twoish weeks of hypomania and then two weeks of even worse depression it gets more noticeable in the winter i thought maybe bipolar but someone pointed out that people with severe trauma can also exhibit this cyclical behaviour so i stopped taking it personally if he didnt talk to me as much and kept track of which week it was i never bring it up but im aware for my own sanity im a very anxious person however this week is one of his down weeks ive heard absolutely nothing from him that is unusual usually i get at least one text in the morning he said hes busy which i believe to an extent the thing is we broke up this week last year and he was acting the exact same and used the exact same excuse he was in fact not doing anything so im wondering if maybe something happened during this week at some point in his life and it will always be a worse mood week for him is that a thing every year at the same time of year as a traumatic event i know especially last year at this time he wanted to unalive so idk if its that or if its something that happened before im giving him his space hes very avoidant and im not going to push him but i do occasionally just ask for proof of life i have a theory that it will get a little better once the seasonal sad gets less severe im the same way in the regard but until then i want to support him without smothering or hovering is there a better way for me to support him am i doing anything that could be potentially harmful in december he had told me that im doing a great job at respecting his boundaries and being supportive so i cant imagine this is my fault but i just want to make sure,post-pandemic

background ive had social anxiety for as long as i can remember i got bullied a lot when i was younger when i was in community college i was studying music theory and wanted to be a composer i loved the thought of it so much possibly being a film composer or do something with jazz i wasnt that good at piano but i played every day lightly for a year or two i wanted to transfer into a good university with a renowned music program in order to do this my counselor told me about a required performance audition i would have to do pass before i could get into this program it involved choosing a couple of pieces from a list of 10 different classical pieces and committing them to memory the performance would have to last at least ten minutes from memory which seemed a little steep i would not be able to use my sheet music to play i practiced every day for weeks and weeks and finally got to the point where i could get through the entire song i felt more or less prepared i was able to play these songs in front of family members and friends the day of the audition finally came i entered the room and there were three judges when i thought there would only be one i was at one side of the room and the three were all the way on the other side i was literally in the spotlight i began to play my piece immediately i noticed that the piano keys felt much different than the ones on my piano at home they felt stiff and awkward before long i started to mess up the song mortified i tried to pick up from where i left off but once i lost my momentum it was nearly impossible to keep going i dont remember much about this point but suffice it to say i was not able to finish the song i was humiliated it was devastating the judges asked me nicely some questions like if i had my music in front of me would i have been able to play i told them probably but i knew i wouldnt have been able to anyway because of the nerves they then told me that i would have the opportunity to try again next year a whole year from then i didnt have that kind of time i was trapped in this moment i couldnt move forward even if i tried if i couldnt pass this audition then i couldnt take any courses at this university at all unless i changed my major which i did end up doing i was absolutely done with music and performing it was too much stress and work i would never be good enough for them so it wasnt even worth trying this was my first taste of the real world of the harsh reality that im not owed anything i felt empty and beyond hopeless i ended up changing my major to business and ended up hating that later on too but still got my degree anyway that was my story to this day i still carry that hurt and humiliation it affects other areas of my life too like right now im completely paralyzed at the thought of interviews i need another job and so i need to do interviews but im afraid to apply to them because they trigger these same feelings of fear of performing in front of others i have an intense fear that i might feel the same way during these interviews as i did during that piano audition foolish out of my element wasting the other persons time and feeling completely awful about myself and my lack of abilities i dont know how to forget this traumatic experience and separate interviews from the memory of the audition they feel so similarthe intense scrutiny of someone judging you negative evaluation interrogating you and finding reasons why they dont want to hire you i feel like they go out of their way to trip me up or catch me in lies while im telling my stories i dont want to feel this way i know its all in my head and thats the whole problem it ended up working out that i didnt pursue music as it would have been extremely hard to support myself on it i got into tech later and am happier in that space but the feelings remain with interviews it feels like i cant get out of my head and just be present with an interviewer i tend to just blank during interviews and cant access my memory even if i prepared beforehand this time around its taking me months and months to overprepare for all the questions they might ask me and even still i feel like it will never be enough ill never be ready for this does anyone have tips on how i can deal with this i dont have money for therapy so ill have to go it alone but im willing to do the work tldr majored in music composition was literally my favorite thing in life and what i wanted to spend my life doing studied it in community college but when transferring to a new universitys music program it required an intensive piano audition performed from memory which i blanked on and completely bombed already had social anxiety it solidified that im not good enough now im facing paralyzing fear preparing for job interviews thanks for listening to my venting,post-pandemic

some days are better than others sleep has been hard to come by my lack of closure in all my situations is eating away at me from the inside i feel not safe in my home and relationships recently like i cant trust anyone i dont want to talk about it with my friends theyve heard it all 1 million times i dont want to talk about it with my partner he doesnt really get it i dont want to talk about it with my family because i dont trust them and they cant know therapy is a moot point because i already know what to do and i just have to let these feelings ride out to the conclusion if it takes longer than a month i will consider going back ugh my situation feels so frozen i hope the universe sends me something but i know its super unlikely i want some kind of closure or something i know it wont happen but i just have to power through because i have no other choice there is no justice for me and i have to accept that i need to make my own through hard work and focusing on myself,post-pandemic

so i got this friend we met a couple of years ago and i also got to know her husband and her two sons the older one was about 5 and his little brother was 2 years old i think they were really lovely the older one a shy and thoughtful kid while the younger one was more playful and wild over the time we lost contact and stayed in touch via facebook so a year back i read a status of her where she claimed that her two sons and herself as well were diagnosed with aspergers autism i write it like that because i dont know if they went to see a doctor and if this diagnose is of any professional nature as she was not one to trust doctors so the last few months she was posting more than usual on facebook and some of the things she wrote left me speechless so her older son is in his last year of grade school and she made a post where she complained about his teacher apparently her son had only done a lot of his homework in a sloppy fashion not finishing most of his assigments so she went to the teacher who did not recognize the autism of her son she had said telling her that he could not do that because he was autistic she then asked people on facebook if they could help with his homework because it was midnight and they were still trying to finish it all i went through more of her posts today there was one were she said she was desperate because her sons didnt want to go to sleep which is pretty normal for children i think and when someone commented a thing like those naughty boys she went wild on them saying it was only because they are autistic and there comes the part that makes me angry she uses the autism of her boys as an excuse for everything sheltering them behind this badge i dont want to sound insensitive now but does it help a child to tell them at every occasion that they are not able to do certain things because of a diagnose this can really twist your life i knew a boy in my teens he got diagnosed with borderline and as he read about the often occuring self harming issue he started to cut his wrists just to fit into that diagnose because sloppy diagnoses often can do more harm than the problem itself i did research and i am by far no expert on this topic but i read that aspergers has not much to do with not finishing things or not listening to your parents the boy might have just been lazy with his homework which is normal for a child but as a parent i can not tell this kid that its okay because his autism is to blame how do you see this i think it does much harm to a child when he is always told that they are different and that they shouldnt set their standarts high because theyll never do better autism cant be abused as an excuse for every problem that occurs with a child its normal that kids misbehave and act shy or lazy but i cant blame autism for everything i mean even if they are autistic in first place they are children who deserve acceptance and encouragement what do you think about it sorry for the long post and my bad english sorry if anything sounds offending i really dont want to offeny anyone im just curious about the topic,pre-pandemic
no matter how i word this post it keeps getting auto deleted so im hoping to keep it short and be more detailed in the comments i befriended a psych ward worker who i kept in touch with after i left they have bpd they crushed me despite knowing what i was there for i feel like thats the reason it keeps getting deleted even though i keep putting a warning flair and nsfw it felt like they were my best friend they said they saw themselves in me bc of the reason i was there i became attached to them it felt like they were the friend i always needed the one who wouldve prevented me from being there in the first place we had so much in common probably exchanged 15000 messages over 7 months it seemed like they cared they made me feel like i mattered so similar it felt like i was talking to myself it felt like we were best friends they even referred to me as bestie on occasion they became cold and just ghosted me i even told them it was making me feel that feeling again and they blocked me why how how could they do this to me knowing everything about me knowing what i was admitted for everything we talked about they pressed me for my deepest darkest secret why did they do that i feel so hollow now it feels like they just used me for entertainment and considering the circumstances we met it feels so fucking wrong like i was taken advantage of for being autistic,post-pandemic
does anyone else have what i could only describe as a limited selection of topics that are actually subjects of your health anxiety like being debilitated by fear with one and then having nearly no abnormal reactions to another disease im a young healthy person so like many others here im terrified of cncer and invariably terminal diseases however as illogical as it is im almost totally unfased by the idea of getting specific types of it for example im terrified of getting melanoma or lymphoma and ive gone through very draining and stressful periods of trying to repeatedly reassure myself that im not in any danger but if i see a person talking about their brain tumor or leukemia diagnoses i can just confidently think yeah thats not going to happen to me and i just find it so weird the craziest part is that i have zero worries about my cardiac health even though my dad passed away from sudden heart disease in middle age one could link my health anxiety stemming from my dad dying abruptly but i personally find little correlation there,post-pandemic

guys let me know how this illness has affected your love life i am an african muslim and mental health has a huge stigma in my community i often feel like i will not find anyone because my illness will be a deal breaker because the truth is if the rules were reversed im not quite sure if i would date somebody who suffered from schizophrenia i feel terrible for saying this out loud but its my truth so i guess i just wanted to know do you guys feel the same way i do about your diagnosis or are you more hopeful,post-pandemic
i was thinking and heard this before in the past a few times but it clicked randomly been sober for almost a year from weekend heavy binger does alcohol when ingested screw up our reward system in our brains including drugs where we are fooled into thinking we are already successful at something aka your reward system was triggered this type of high makes people act in such a way that is the same as when you achieve something great in life made me think why people entertain stupid conversations while drunk or high off coke and i think its cuz you already feel successful because of the high youre on but it really is an illusion let me know what you guys think,post-pandemic
1 you need to chance it this is the big deal this is the thing i cant say for certain that there is nothing wrong with you physically no one can and i know what you feel what if there is something what if i convince myself ive got anxiety now only to end up with a morbid disease wont i feel much worse the thing is there is no way of knowing that for certain though of course the chances are very low the chances are if you are here now cleared of all those medical tests and such the only thing that is pathological about you is anxiety anxiety is a pathalogical liar however you will never heal from anxiety if you dont ever chance it and live your life in constant fear and dread and panic you know this no matter what this is just no way to live you have got to chance it despite physical symptoms despite everything chance it now and go along with it physical symptoms wont just go away but you have to keep telling yourself that you have just got anxiety if you are ever to recover from this 2 start doing something you enjoy i cant stress this enough anxiety is a way of our brains to say hey you are important too you have got to give yourself some time every day to do something you enjoy doing watch movies play computer games whatever you will just forget about this irrational feeling that is anxiety and in time you will see how silly it was of you to feel that way 3 start exercising one of the things that made a lot of difference in my case was exercise i enrolled in a gym and went every day except sundays i would feel the anxiety literally vanish as i ran on the treadmill exercise is how you banish anxiety it just vanishes all of a sudden even though for a short time 4 meds help this is a sensitive subject but if you are prescribed medicine be sure to use them as your doctor described it might take some weeks and even months for them to take effect they can make it easier for you to deal with anxiety meds help but they dont cure they help a lot though they can make you see things more rationally 5 start therapy start paying a therapist instead of a physician for myself cbt helped me to such an extent that it became a part of my life it helped me see hiw irrational and negative i have been i now look back and only feel silly for having such heightened levels of anxiety now i am no longer frightened and live my life confidently i owe it to therapy,post-pandemic
idk who can relate but this combination is ruining my life both diagnosed and wouldnt be surprised about asd but i wasnt tested for it with the adhd i have almost 0 motivation and struggle to do anything positive for myself with the ocd im convinced im going to die constantly either a freak accident car crash murder and other intrusive thoughts that come up so i think does it really matter if my life is a mess when ill probably get killed at some point soon why should i even try im on a stimulant now but a low dose so its going to be a few weeks until i get to increase and reevaluate i just dont know if this dread is going to get better im afraid even if i can finally get some things done in my life im still going to have the ocd thoughts looming over me i feel confused on what to do with everything in my life,post-pandemic

so from ages 13 to 15 i was groomed by a woman and i sent her hundreds of nsfw pictures which she sold on cp sites every since then i have a deathly fear of young women around the late teens early 20s age to the point where i dont let my 19 year old sister touch me or be in the same room as me but today today was different i let my sister hold my hand and i didnt freak out run away or cry i had anxiety the entire time but it wasnt a out burst like normal my therapist taught me to associate my sister with trust and how she would never try to hurt me and i did that i told myself in my head all she is doing is holding your hand thats it and it worked im so proud of myself i had to share it somewhere i know it might be dumb to some but for me it was amazing,pre-pandemic
its almost like i feel im from a different planet and of a different species whether it be ppl at my php friends ive met hell even uber drivers who have shared their story to me i see myself and my own experiences so much in theirs whether it be past events present tribulations or future anxieties i feel drawn to hearing out and relating to their suffering this connection for me supercedes things like ethnicity i mean i am a latinoasian mutt anyway so i never really connected with anyone on this level but even if i did i feel like the spread of variation of experiences from my illness is much tighter than something that i find to be so broad and insignificant anyone else feel the same way edit to clarify i dont necessarily mean bipolar ppl who are currently symptomatic in hindsight to how i act i dont even want to be around myself when im like that for me its more about the experiences of the past and trying to recover as opposed to the symptoms themselves which i fucking hate,pre-pandemic

i f21 come from a very financially unstable family we constantly got evicted from different homes because my parents always had trouble paying rent there were times when we didnt even have enough money for food or public transit obviously my family never got me any help for my mental health if anything they only made my mental health worse because they were also very toxic i have since moved out and i dont talk to them at all anymore i only got my diagnosis recently at age 21 when i could finally afford to get one and also live a much more comfortable life i had suspicions about being autistic for years so i did extensive research i read books and articles watched videos of detailed presentations from licensed counselors and psychologists and read the dsm5 criteria i never wanted to self diagnose i only did because it was all i could afford to do before my diagnosis i confided in my friend who was one of the only people i really trusted she said you cant just say you have something because you saw a tiktok video about it i wasnt even using tiktok at all also her family is much wealthier than mine im not saying self diagnosis is valid but the reasons why someone might be undiagnosed are not having money family never understood or cared less knowledge on autism in the past etc why do you think so many people are getting professionally diagnosed as adults autismmental illness fakers do piss me off but what also pisses me off is people jumping to conclusions and writing someone off as a faker before letting them explain not everyone can afford healthcare some of us can barely afford to live,post-pandemic
sorry about mistakes english is not my first language i have been together with my bf for almost 2 years now when we first started dating for the first 6 months i really was normal because i was on my antidepressants i stopped taking them around a year ago and i started experiencing aggression irritability episodes again am i have heavily affected my bfs mental health because of that i honestly am shocked that he has put up with it for so long but recently we had been having a much better time communicating previously every one of our arguments happened because of me being mean ive been home since monday and he had disappeared for like 3 days from wednesday till todays morning he didnt really communicated with me about why he had disappeared but id did blow up his phone quite a bit anyways when he reappeared he texted me that he doesnt feel good and he has to deal with some dark stuff right now mentioning that he also needs some peace and quiet of course i understand that but im still quite emotionally unstable due to the fact that it feels like hes about to leave me so im literally a mess how do i assess the fact that i need some clarity about our relationship without overreacting how do i apologize for my behavior i am so scared to lose him,post-pandemic

im sure we all get this especially the answer seekers among us who make frequent visits to the gp im in the uk you see constant stories in the tabloids of people who are now dying because their doctor kept missing their death sentence symptoms especially those that you currently have i know that these happenings make it to the junkpress because theyre so rare but fuck me if its not exhausting trying to deal with scary symptoms when your doctors cant find anything wrong with you after tests physical exams scans etc and after years of symptoms my brain keeps telling me that they missed something at the start and by the time they discovered it ill be too far gone to treat i apologise if ive screwed up triggered anyone or posted in the wrong place im new here and to be honest the anxiety is affecting my ability to think logically edit i apologise for not replying to individual comments im still unsure if what i can say here without being banned which is understandable because i know how triggering these discussions can be i fully understand the physical affects you guys gave described though i was diagnosed with panic disorder secondary to illness anxiety disorder and was subsequently put on beta blockers i wonder if that has helped any of you ive actually found yoga quite helpful which i didnt think would be of any use due to being a sort of scientificrationallyminded sort of person but i do find it really calming when i realise theres nothing i can do until i can see a doctor i think its the feeling of your body working in a way thats aimed at mental wellbeing rather than working out to be physically healthy that sort of grounds me a little whether or not meds or excerise works for you and neither work to really combat this constant limbo resolutely but i hope you all find something that does id like to say thank you for replying and its comforting to know im not alone respect to you all people underestimate how hard it is to function while dealing with this,post-pandemic

currently been tapering from multiple drugs bromazolam and other benzos pregabalin zopiclone carisoprodol recently odsmt and some others i dont use consistently or daily also to mention ive never used things like heroin fentanyl meth crack etc and that absolutely doesnt make me any different from people who do use those substances i guess i just have always known i would die pretty quickly if i used those and so had some form of self control in regard to that i am constantly doing this to myself to resolve my never ending unbearable mental and physical pain i guess i technically can shut up and bear it which ive done for long periods of time without drugs but im a shell of a person without drugs when im on drugs i feel like i used to feel many years ago before things got as bad as they did mental and physical health wise never been able to find the courage to kill myself to put an end to all of this because i share a conscience with my overbearing mom and the thought of her finding my dead body will always stop me even if im in a crazy drug induced state i feel like i stay alive for my familys sake and almost wish i didnt have a family who loved and cared about me so i could just end this anyways thats just what has me making this post as im not even in a full state of withdrawal yet just on a lowered dosage of everything and so feeling like shit and even thought ive been lowering my dosages i got into yet another argument with my overbearing mom and took so much shit i woke up passed out on the floor maybe i was trying to kill myself subconsciously dont know but it scared the shit out of me even though this has happened many times throughout my life but the thing thats making it the worst is that the reason i use drugs is because of the horrible mental and physical pain i experience on a daily basis so yes the withdrawals are terrifying and painful but the thought that once im off everything its back to where i was a shell of a person in constant pain so then comes the thoughts of why should i quit drugs what is that going to do for me besides maybe alleviate the stresses of making sure i have a constant supply of drugs thats nothing compared to what i deal with sober also wanna mention ive been to rehabs and doctors countless times to try and resolve these issues to which nothing has ever been found to be wrong with me and i dont have health anxiety these are specific and identifiable pains that dont go away and do not change also i dont have insurance anymore so even if i wanted to go seek more help from these people who have never helped me it is not an option sorry for the long rant i wanted to bring up the point of how i see some people handle withdrawals from drugs like champions and others are in the worst agony imaginable is that because say someone for example whos using opiates to alleviate physical pain quitting is just going to go back to just being in unbearable pain and maybe another user solely has generalized anxiety not to downplay the severity of this disorder so their withdrawals arent as bad i found before i developed crippling physical pain my drug withdrawals were not nearly as difficult i guess its a philosophical question i have and i probably didnt even explain it very well whats the point of all this suffering just to go back to suffering being sober even for years is nothing compared to when im in a state of constant drug use and seeking i fucking hate being sober for countless reasons this is such a mess of a post i apologize i keep all my thoughts inside and needed to get them out somewhere maybe itd help to hear other peoples thoughts on this im going to go write some music now to get some of this hateful bitter energy out in a healthy way if anyone reads this or replies to it thank you its a lot for a stranger on the internet to give a shit about i know i dont have the mental energy to handle a post like this in any kind of way tldr is drug crcessation worse for people who will simply return to crippling agony once sober that the drugs were alleviating i see a lot of people get sober and say its the best thing they ever did and feel great never in my life has that resonated with me thats never been the case for me after going through this so many times im a bitter hateful shitty shell of a person when im sober even when its for years and i should have nothing in the world to complain about besides my own brain and body,post-pandemic

my boyfriend is an alcoholic and as hard it sometimes is i still want to be beside him were both around forty and seen some shit i handle mine by smoking way too much weed so we arent really even judging each others addictions but one thing that i have a continuous problem with is that he often says that hell go visit the grocery store and come back right after and when he exits the front door he goes straight to the bar this often happens at the same minute the bars open so i doubt he doesnt know where hes going im familiar and understanding with certain lies that come from shame and low self esteem and such things revolving around addiction but this one hurts me as it leaves me hanging with feelings of being disrespected as i dont try to control him or judge him about leaving i could also be doing and planning something else instead of waiting him also because i dont understand the mental gymnastics behind this lie at all as its something hell get caught right away its not like we havent talked about this before but i feel that i need to set firm boundary with this as i have started to harbour resentment about the issue and it will kill the relationship at some point i know to stay calm and not to pick a fight while doing so but i still felt like asking other people whats the best way to do this or how manageable this kind of boundary might even be for someone with active problems with alcohol,post-pandemic

so ive been suffering from health anxiety for some months now and im stuck in a pretty bad episode right now which made me reflect a lot and i think ive realized the root cause of my worries about dying or suffering an illness that will seriously limit my ability to live normally i love life and everything it has to offer me there are so so many things im yet to experience and of course those will include bad or negative things as well but i am so so curious to discover whats yet to come ive been in horrible situations already with a pretty bad panic disorder for some time and just traumatizing events but ive never lost my love for life however i feel like this love is literally killing me i put so much pressure on myself to experience everything that im in absolute horror by the thought of not being able to because of being ill or dead im 21 and life should be long for me but what if its not what if i die before i find my true love before i went to that fun holiday with my friends etc it really drives me crazy and i was wondering if anyone has a personal life philosophy to share as to how to accept that there just is no certainty that ill get to live all those parts of life,post-pandemic

hi im a resident in psychiatry also suffering from schizophrenia spectrum disorder in my country we psychiatrist are also psychotherapist and must choose between psychoanalysis cbt and systemic therapies i struggle to make that choice at first i wanted to choose psychoanalysis since i had 2 wonderful therapist of that side that helped me a lot but i also happened to have had obsessional almost delusional about psychoanalysis supervisors saying that psychosis are the worst or that countertransferance is biaised in psychosis doesnt help theres a lot of clich and hopelessness cbt speaks to me because it is more evidence based but it feels also bland and i never had it personally it looks both magical and scientific but also superficial and enclosed but at least it drives me less crazy a bit depressed though reading all those neurocognitive disorders were supposed to have is depressing i obviously want to work in the field of psychosis specially in early intervention and i want the best for my patients and my practice my psychiatrist told me not to worry too much about that choice because i can influence in my way my practice whats your experience with those kind of therapy those who has the chance to have psychotherapy how was it what kind theres a lack of cbt practioners in my region specially that does cognitive remediation and also theres a lack of psychoanalyst that accept psychotic patient so in both case id be useful,post-pandemic
i was never a good friend i was always a problem for you and i was always a fool and did not understand i think that being sorry for the millionth thing will be useless and you are no longer the same the story is over i cannot fix what was lost i can try to make the competition better if i succeed in that i wish you were the first friend i lost but you are the last and no one will come after you because you are the last in my life my life is no longer life and i only want to die now but i dont want to take this friendship with me to the grave i want it to stay with you so you will remember me if you naturally want that i closed everything in front of me and life did the same thing and i had no other way to be a normal person again i was never a good friend and i would never be a perfect friend as i dreamed i am just a fool everyone left him to die alone goodbye my last friend if you want to say goodbye and peace to all the people in this world that left me suffering alone,post-pandemic
i have always had a hard time eating in the morning and if i dont take anything with my meds they hit like a truck and it does not feel very good these instant oatmeal packets save me since cooking actual rolled oats would take too much time they almost always have a 53 deal at kroger unfortunately the less sugar box has 2 less packets ugh but i prefer having less sugar in my diet and i buy like 1015 boxes at a time i usually hate the slop texture of oatmeal but the trick i found is to pour hot water over them stir for like 1015 seconds then add cold milkwater and keep stirring its gonna be soft but still have some cereal texture to it and not just goopen sloppen gruel that i usually hate about oatmeal i usually eat 3 packets alongside some kind of fruit and maybe and egg sandwich for protein helps the meds last longer throughout the day,post-pandemic

i need to call work soon to say that i will be sick this weekend but i am so frickin terrified it has to be a call were not allowed to text or email or anything im scared that everybody will hate me or they will see me as an inconvenience or a burden my manager and team leaders are quite supportive luckily however still i am crapping myself im literally thinking about going into work just so i can avoid the phone call but i cant as im so sick that i can barely walk and might need to go to hospital soon if it gets worse i dont know why but this simple phone call literally feels like my life is coming to an end i have this sense of doom where it feels like its the end of the world i know when it comes to making the call my heart will race so hard and ill probably end up being sick i can imagine my manager will be supportive on the call but i just get this vision of when he ends the call hell talk to other colleagues and say things like for fucks sake hes off sick what an idiot now we have to find fucking cover we shouldve never hired him i know it will be a major nuisance even if he doesnt say it to me directly and i hate inconveniencing people im a massive people pleaser this may sound weird but i honestly do hope i end up in hospital soon because then at least they will see i am not lying and genuinely am sick maybe i can also get some sort of doctors note then ugh social anxiety sucks why do i put everybody else before me why cant i see myself as worthy and as important as everyone else,post-pandemic
im actually super frustrated about this ive always struggled sociallyi have autism and lots of nts have been able to immediately read that and then bullyavoid me as a result but ive been trying to make an effort to socialize and make friends so far i have a good amount given how much ive struggled in the past however i made a post on a local sub on my other reddit account months ago asking to reach out to other people who maybe also are struggling to find friendships and the post blew up i had maybe 70 people dm me and spark up a conversation but with most of those conversations i noticed i was solely putting effort in these conversations would just mostly be me asking a person about them their interests how theyre doing etc but there would be little to no reciprocation and its not that im not trying to get to know these people i am but it does suck a bit when it just feels so one sided it also confuses the hell out of me because i can tell theyre clearly not interested so then why reach out to me in the first place ive experienced a bit of this irl but i almost always experience it with people i talk to online even people who ive known for a while ive been having to cut people off because all they want to seemingly talk about is themselves and i feel like im just a soundboard its getting exhausting and i want to crawl back inside of my shell,post-pandemic

today a colleague was talking about how lithium the thing used in batteries and other stuff was also being used to medicate people with mental problems that those people would end up with scrambled brains at first i was incredibly embarrassed and upset however i decided that i needed to say something im reasonably close with the other colleagues present although they dont know about my bp they know ive had depression etc i told this individual that i take lithium and i suffered from depression and ocd as a teenager he asked me if i was worried about taking something they use in batteries and i explained that there are many chemicals that are broadly used and that taking lithium helps me to be the best version of myself everyone was kind of awkward and i told them that it wasnt something to worry about and that mental health issues need to be discussed openly the colleague later came and apologized incase they had offended me my point is dont feel ashamed because you are taking your medication be proud because you are working your ass off,pre-pandemic
as a lot of you probably are too this virus has been cause for some of my anxiety recently most of my anxiety regarding it is due to the world simply not knowing how to contain it so i decided to assume i will get it and look at it from a backwards standpoint statistically we see worrisome mortality rates and our minds wander i think they should be looked at differently according to worldometers for people aged 80 years the likelihood of making a full recovery is over 85 if youre a healthy 84 year old chances are youre fine and i cant imagine many of us here are that age not to mention from that age group and down the death risk diminishes drastically im still going to be worried about this as a lot of you will be too but because the media may be exaggerating and causing some hysteria i thought it would be nice to provide an uplifting statistic god bless,pre-pandemic

link to previous post im not a doctor so only read further if youve been checked out by your doctor and told youre healthy i wrote a post with tips for heart health anxiety a while back ive been struggling with some health anxiety in the past few days and i wanted to put some of the things that help me calm down in here x200b 1 a heart can either be healthy or sick theres no inbetween option a healthy heart is one thats been checked by doctors in some cases multiple times and by multiple doctors and theyve all agreed that theres nothing wrong with it the heart is obviously a vital organ so if there was something seriously wrong it would show symptoms but get this it would show symptoms constantly it wouldnt be like oh let me hurt a bit then calm down for the rest of the day and tomorrow ill get a few palpitations and then be fine for a few weeks and then act up again uh uh that is how a healthy heart acts when being confronted with other things such as stress anxiety food consumption alcohol sleep or lack of it smoking hard exercise hormones a sick heart would let you know there would be symptoms that dont go away a swelling in legs that lasts weeks pain that never stops breathing issues that get worst through months etc and for all of you that have been checked by doctors and told all clear a sick heart would show up on every no matter how basic of a test doctors do it would show up in blood works it would show up in ekg it would show up during a basic listen of the heart that doctors do all the damn time every time you go and ask for a check up the symptoms of a sick heart do not hide they make themselves present and every doctor will be able to see them and send you for further help asap x200b 2 a sudden heart attackcardiac arrest can happen under only a few circumstances x200b your heart is sickborn with a defect from birth these types of sudden heart attacksarrest are often if not always the result of someone not having symptoms and not checking their heart fully theyre usually quite young people whos never been to a doctor to get their heart checked and just assume that theres nothing wrong with them i have a friend 22f with no symptoms that went for a daytodate easy check up and the doctor heard a murmur in her heart straight away and now she knows what to do and what not to do if your doctor has checked you and told you your heart is healthy that means its just that healthy with no birth defect x200b youve lived usually 40 years of unhealthy lifestyle and youre probably also dealing with other issues such as high cholesterol arteries build up etc things that doctors again would have caught by now and told you to be careful and change your lifestyle for the better if you dont want to suffer a heart attack x200b an accident like getting electrocuted x200b a healthy heart does not just give up without outside force making it do so that outside force can also be food stress sedentary lifestyle but these are all things you can help yourself with if its something you cant help like lets say hormones during periodpregnancies like it was for me or work related stress all you can do is wait it out and believe it will come to an end it always does x200b 3 people who are perfectionists and good at focusing at a specific task until they fix the problem can and most likely will induce their own heart symptoms i know that i do im not much of a perfectionist myself but i can focus very strongly on things that i deem important if theres a problem ill focus on it until ive made it go away however example focusing on a heart palpitations ive got only makes me more stressed which in result brings even more palpitations and the circle begins realising that youre good at focusing can help you next time a symptom appears and your first instinct is to focus on it examine it from all sides think of all possible outcomes and completely ruin your mental peace in the process which leads to even more anxiety and even more symptoms x200b its nearly impossible to stop focusing on something that scares you so the alternative is instead of stopping the focus to shift it to logic shift it to past experiences when youve had this symptom and its gone away on its own shift to doctors telling you youre fine shift to i just had a lot of chocolate today its hormones its just stress and no this is not ignoring the problem believe me ive been there and id tell myself what are you doing how can you try to calm yourself that its just stress what if this time its not what if this time youre really really dying and well the simple what if this time in there should be enough to remind me that its happened before and well im still here x200b i hope this helps you a bit remember you can always get checked by a doctor even if its your 100th time if that brings you peace theres no shame in that i hope you feel better vey soon and have a wonderful day,pre-pandemic

the internet cannot possibly diagnose you for it is literally unable to account for family history severitylevel of pain and other sensations its always vague for example saying if you have chest tightness get to the er instead of if your chest tightness is manageable enough to ignore then youre fine biological diversityhow your body just is we are not perfectly made creatures something you have surely all noticed is that there is something wrong at any given second of any given day and that is normal what youve done that day what youve eaten that day or past few days the state of the environment around you how you slept last night your entire health history remember its not just that the internet over exaggerates everything in order to avoid liability its also that it literally cannot possibly tell you exactly what is wrong for it lacks every single piece of information necessary,pre-pandemic
ive always had a problem since i was little and at the age of 23 they gave it a name for me anxiety disorder has always been a pussy thing for spoiled dads sons maybe because of the series tv or films for teenagers that i saw when i was little i dont know ive always loved this thing of being different from others a little strange particular unique but at 23 you realize that this thing still makes you seem strange but in a different way in an unpleasant way you hate people you isolate yourself you cant stand silence concentration problems you feel stupid you even end up hating your character being empathetic becomes a weakness i never imagined that this shit would lead me to have so many problems how do you live with this shit medicines drugs therapy how do you accept being weak vulnerable different from others and still have friends who support you do you have friends and if the answer is yes how do you keep them from escaping ive always tried to act tough uncaring insensitive because girls like this stuff but the truth is that im weak small and now i dont even know who i am or what i would like to be,post-pandemic
i am not sure how to even say this i have always felt like i needed alcohol to be comfortable confident or competent i needed it to unwind to feel less to be me slowly i have come to realize all it does is lead to more unease a lack of selfconfidence increased selfdoubt and incompetency my family struggles with overconsumption no one in my immediate environment from my parents to my siblings to my inlaws recognize the toll that alcohol has in their lives no one calls it alcoholism or alcohol abuse and yet it is so many people are walking around in this unhinged state beholden to their next drink it has invaded society it has impeded in our traditions daily routines and familial events so much so that the nondrinker is the outlier is this what it is like on outside will i always feel the need to justify my nondrinking to everyone else does this part get easier is it always us vs them i see alcohol now for all that it is it is in every media space every television show movie ad social media post it plagues us will i always be this hyperfocused as i hopefully maintain this sobriety journey i grew up in a reactive household full of emotions fueled further by intoxication my hope is that i can have the willpower to break that cycle for my own kids godwilling,post-pandemic

so i used to drink occasionally while in the marines but now everytime i start to like someone or get attached i tend to drink heavy and everyday just to escape the feelings of having feelings i tend to drink a lot to mask how i feel about a person but still show them love weather is sober or not they never know im drunk or not im drunk as im typing this right now but it all starts when i start talking to someone or liking someone in general i feel like i do it just to avoid disappointment also if they were to ever leave me or neglect me in such a way i wouldnt have to deal with it because i feel numb i dont know i know i need help but im young 21m i any sound like a pussy but it doesnt matter,post-pandemic

ive suffered from sexual anxiety for years i am scared to have sex and contract a disease which then scares me into being intimate with whomever i am talking to at the time i also think watching porn for 15 years and social media makes me feel like my member isnt large enough which then gives me more anxiety when it comes to sex that the girl will be disappointed and talk about it to other people which leads me being afraid of not being able to get erect when the time comes and then when all the anxiety is covering me in the moment i dont perform well i start to question if its because im not interested in women at all do you see this spiral i wish i could live without this pain of anxiety,post-pandemic

i started my education before i knew i was bipolar i really struggled for the first few years as id often start off the semester in a hypomanic state and finish it in a deep depression this was a cycle for about 45 years often accompanied by course withdrawals and a couple failures however a very observant md saw my cycles and referred me to the schools expert in bipolar disorder he diagnosed me in 20 minutes and started me on a regimen of medications the final year and a half went amazingly well so well in fact that i was able to finish all the courses i needed with good grades this morning i got word that im officially done edit thanks for the reward kind stranger,pre-pandemic

ive been curious if anyone else has experienced this and i would like to get feedback from not just nature lovers but those who arent so bothered about nature either so also if you arent really a nature lover if you have been in places like forestswoodlands or very wildnatural picturesque areas have you nevertheless found any kind of healing or extreme calm simply by being in that environment i tend to feel this strongly myself though i know that i am a nature lover so im curious if its just simply connected with my love of nature or whether it could be a universally healing thing independent of being a nature lover or not i suppose that because i have a lot of social anxiety the remote nature of a lot of wildnature environments give me a strong sense of peace and calm eventhough it is still outside and public and its very refreshing like a reset button in some ways im definitely not a new age type hippy person but i find it profoundly uplifting and calming i know that some people have investigated what some have termed forest therapy or forest bathing it would be very interesting if one day someone does more in depth and comprehensive research and study into this thanks,pre-pandemic
i had a baby doll as a kid from as early as 2 or 3 based on photos ive seen i took it everywhere with me i brought it for show and tell in 1st grade i was at the store one day with my grandmother there was a toy stroller that caught my attention i had 20 saved from a birthday but it cost twice as much i was going to see what other stuff there was but then my grandma offered to pay for the other half so i got it and i loved it it was perfect for my doll and some of my stuffed animals i had it for maybe a week my dad talked me into giving it away to a girl a little bit younger than me how it would be a nice thing to do and that shed enjoy it she lived with her dad and grandma im not sure what happened to her mom i dont think it was because they couldnt afford such things for her they were probably even better off financially than we were looking back i think i was just manipulated into thinking i was doing something nice for someone and that my dad was just trying to distance me from toys that werent appropriate for a boy i still had my baby doll at least theres no way my mom would let that have been taken maybe a year or so later i fell for a similar thing when he wanted me to donate my five care bears to less fortunate children oh well i think my dad genuinely thought it was in my best interest maybe it was sucks being manipulated but i hope other people got to enjoy those things at least my mom still has the doll in a box full of precious items to her im 100 comfortable with my gender but i often fail to be aware of it but i fail to conceptualize gender norms i had more traditional interests as well like legos train sets hot wheels etc tldr my dad owes me five care bears and a stroller for my childhood baby doll,post-pandemic
ive cut off my friends for over a year now but they werent really friends just people i knew in all honesty i never was able to develop a true friendship in high school due to my reoccurring depression and generalized anxiety but now i have no one and its mostly caused by my own actions due to deleting all social medias avoiding social interaction at school and talking to no one when youve given up on life a long time ago you dont care if you have friends so ive been isolating myself until noone remembers me eventually i will have the courage to kill myself and when i do noone will remember if i was even here,pre-pandemic

hsp highly sensitive person hi everyone just wanted to share my progress as im very proud of myself and my body my anxiety started last year after the death of my mom being constantly pressured by my dad and spending one evening thinking i was dying for about 7 hours after eating too many edibles by accident trauma ptsd stress and being a hsp were all a bit too much for my nervous system so it got inflamed and perceives everything strange or overstimulating as danger like a cinema for example too loud and flashy lights i travelled to a theme park last month my body hated it but i loved it i taught it that its nothing to be afraid of it calmed down by the end of day two there im scared of flying but we flew there and back again had a mini panic attack but worked through it had tattoo removal appointment and shook and cried during the thing because the pain was unbearable this is my 4th one but first one since this whole mess with anxiety started im definitely more sensitive to pain now i calmly warned the doctor that my body has an inflamed nervous system and that i have no idea how its gonna respond to pain stimuli it entered fight or flight i soldiered through it he advised me to take vitamin b supplements as they are good for this type of thing so im doing that too now had a facial beauty procedure done yesterday micro needling and laser stuff and i also warned that doctor about my condition i didnt cry but shook like crazy legs and arms went numb heart racing sweating all over my fight or flight kicked in and i sat through it my face is all swollen today and i am sitting through it and taking care of it so in the last month i for the first time since it all started travelled by plane visited another country rode roller coaster and thrill and scary rides had tattoo removal app and did some light antiaging work on my face i will not let my anxiety stop me from doing things i am so proud of myself and my body for pushing through even though when shit gets really scary my anxiety symptoms are heart palpitations 3 second ones multiple times a day pain in chest and left arm pressure in head throat and chest tingly and numb feet hands and face shaking feeling terrified when adrenaline hits feeling a cold sensation washing over me adrenaline disassociating and more sometimes they all hit at ones sometimes a combination of these i am so much better than last year its been a journey and two psychiatrists told me that my condition cant be managed without antidepressants didnt listen to them for a minute im using magnesium citrate and now vitamin b and d supplements i do yoga and lift weights and generally try to take care of my nervous system by regulating it and nurturing it so just wanted to share that i will continue going to my tattoo removal and beauty appointments i need to get them done but they are also a good practice for my nervous system sending you all love and hugs if i can do it so can everyone its very hard but its very much doable,post-pandemic

i recently read about attention seeking behaviour its various forms and why a person may have it could relate to it 50 percent i have really bad self esteem and am constantly comparing myself to others it also sounds like one of the driving factors for my social anxiety tbh i thought that its a sign of npd or hpd but i dont go out of my way to be under the limelight nor do i think that im better than others its more of trying to repeat the same jokesstories because it feels like no one heard or reacted properly seeking validation and sometimes fishing for compliments when talking about hobbies so ill feel like im good at something im aware that i do this and hate it too if someone shows a small negative reaction then id go into a spiral of self hatred i really dont know if this is a common sign of having low self esteem or covert narcissism,post-pandemic

i know i can be a lot sometimes more now that im super lonely and have no friends except one after i went through a lot of life changes my brother and dog died i was forced to move twice because of this i have no future have to work through childhood traumas and abuse alone after my brother unalived himself i was a super depressed and terrible person to deal with and i lost my only 2 friends now i have no one except this one friend he was the best and there for me when no one was i did too much as usual and i get on his nerves because he cant spend every day talking to me i can be sad and point out how he has everyone multiple siblings lives with his partner hes about to marry steady job family and friends who love him and he obviously doesnt like it when i do that last time he ignored me for 2 years and ghosted without a reason he said he missed me and was hoping id reach out but i did numerous times i spent 2 years talking to no one except one day i became desperate and reached out to him and he got a notification despite muting me we started talking and i put super dramatic crap into his life i always talked about all my insecurities and how i hated my life and then my alcoholic n dad started wreaking havoc at home and i told him everything hes sick of me now and hasnt responded in 4 days which is kind of unusual for us i think hes going back to ignoring me and not just for 2 years this time but probably for an extended period and for life no one understands how lonely and painful this is to have no one my parents are going through a divorce and putting everything on me again i dont even have my parents to lean on my brother is extremely lucky hes gone and doesnt have to live in misery the only person i have is my mom and im clearly not her favorite because she speaks how my brother used to help her even when he was alive i helped her with every small thing she asked for help with but she keeps telling stories about how he was the best and helped her and was the best son this life feels like a cruel cosmic joke,post-pandemic

i felt inspired to make this post after reading an aita post where op was making blanket assumptions about bpd as someone whos struggled with bpd all my life and done and said some toxic things to people i cared about im always trying my very best to improve with every new person i meet what you claim to be bpd people acting nice in order to manipulate you is in reality my trying my best to be a better person its a genuine part of my personality bpd is hard to deal with its a fucked up illness and most people can only control it not completely get rid of it just like a person with alcoholism may relapse so can bpd people with good intentions lash out in times in distress this is not an intentional manipulation mechanism we really were as nice or as loving as we appeared we werent faking it in order to get into your good graces we just have an illness that were trying to recover from but its so hard and we slipped up and were really sorry and it doesnt excuse any damage we did to you but please dont frame us as doing it on purpose and that our kindness and caring was a front i just wanted to say this to all pwbpd out there you can do better every time it hurts when a loved one cuts you off or when you feel like you have to cut them off but always believe that you can do better edit my first gold thank you so much kind reddit stranger 3,pre-pandemic

im so exhausted i have heds depression anxiety insomnia and probably a handful of other undiagnosed issues im so exhausted all the goddamn time i only work up to 3 days a week 46hr shifts in fast food and even that small bit takes up so much of my energy that i cant fucking do anything else the rest of the days i have free that week most of the time i come home so worn out that all i can do is crawl into my bed i just turned 21 and i genuinely dont think i have a future ahead of me despite trying so hard my entire life so far to be hopeful and positive i keep thinking about how it probably wouldve been better if i had actually succeeded in one of my suicide attempts as a teen good things and happy times do come around but it feels like no matter what i do i cant escape from the feeling that my existence is torture or a punishment for some fucked up shit i mustve done in a past life or something i have no fucking idea how im meant to build a life for myself and live another 50 years when i feel like ive had to fight tooth and nail against my defective fucking brain and body just to make it this far i had a tiring but overall okay day yesterday but when i woke up this morning i was hit like a truck by an extremely intense feeling of despair at having woken up everyday is a battle and i feel like ive already lost before it can even start anymore what do i do is there even hope for me is this world worth even trying to stay alive for anymore i want so desperately to be able to enjoy life and to be happy and sometimes i do find myself there but one way or another i always find myself suffering even worse than i was before please please please if you have any advice or have felt like this and managed to find a better path please tell me how i cant go on like this anymore,post-pandemic
i am almost 21 years old and i have been smoking marijuana every day multiple times a day for the last 6 years as i started i used it as a way to cope with familial issues and the stresses of my life and then my life got worse because it made me lazy unmotivated and gave me terrible social anxiety so i lost friends quit sports and hobbies and failed in school so i smoked more and more and more as my life deteriorated and i became depressed anxious suicidal and just all around miserable for 6 years i lost touch with everything that truly mattered to me all i did was smoke weed and every single day i would try to get myself to stop smoking because i knew it was ruining my life and i hated my life but i never could stop this is my 42nd day off the ganja which is the longest ive gone since i started 6 years ago it has been going well i have been doing well in school i am taking 5 classes i have good grades good relationships with teachers i got a job as a waiter i have plans for my future and i am much more social however things still arent all that great i am still pretty depressed i still am not going to the gym like i want to and a lot of other thing are still not going as i would like i am sure it takes more than 40 days and that in a year i will be even better but it is getting very hard i am still no where near the mental head space i was before i smoked however it is evident that things are better the first 35 or so days i didnt really crave it at all it was just hard to deal with reality and face my problems instead of escaping with weed i was sweating all day every day from all parts of my body and irritable the first week but other than that nothing else really as i got to day 40 i began craving weed putting my jacket on to go to the dispensary and then taking it off and trying to convince myself to not go today i was pretty much ready to walk out the door and go buy a cartridge but i did not its just so hard to face my reality and where i am at in life but i know that smoking is the reason my life is the way it is and the only way to reverse it is to be sober and definitely not to smoke for that will only make it worse i am looking for words of encouragement motivation and anything pretty much from others who were in a similar place as me and stopped smoking to help me continue on this mission thanks guys,post-pandemic
until you find your next song victim and ultimately get sick of the previous song you played to death i have so many songs i listened to 20 times in a row after hearing them for the first time because they are either just so beautiful or extremely cathartic to listen to its like it puts me in a sort of daydream,post-pandemic
i dont know if this is common with bpd but ive been told that i have anorexia i dont believe it because while i am terrified of gaining weight and constantly want to lose weight i still eat three small balanced meals a day and sometimes a snack or dessert even it feels wrong to say i have anorexia when other people are struggling so much more i just feel a lot of guilt about this diagnosis and like i have to get worse in order to earn the title i know the thinkings messed up but its ingrained in my head i want to lose weight so that i dont feel guilty about it i dont know im just wondering if im not alone,post-pandemic
long story short im diagnosed with bpd i got the diagnosis got given some meds and then kind of forgotten about because my case was for the moment being not as severe as others im not sure i got it in me to fight through that system again to sit in a queue for months just to get a psychiatrist that wont be able to help me ive been in and out of it for some years now and sometimes things did get better but that is before it eventually fell apart again love doesnt work for me and i am under the belief that i am more or less destined to die alone left behind and forgotten when my time comes people will maybe shed a tear or two if i was to kill myself grieve for a year if even that and then move on with their lives they say the care but never bother to check in with me the only reason i am still here is for my family and ive tried to get better really put in the work for it and all eating healthier not that i am overweight but just to feel more fresh and energetic looking into pursuing a career in psychology or just in general continue studying creating plans to give myself a purpose but at the end of the day i know it wont work out for me that all these attempts and minor changes wont help me get better wont help me find love or be at peace with myself and who i am,post-pandemic

i met with my psych on the 14th of feb and he is putting me on lamictal and taking me off of zyprexa and trileptal so i halved my dose of zyprexa and trileptal and started on low dose lamictal i have had insomnia 3 days i might be getting 34 hours a night i do try to sleep but i end up just laying there and im obsessed with perfume ive been reading the subreddits about perfume googling perfume reading a shit ton of reviews on perfume on different sites all day long then i went to ulta yesterday in a snow storm an hour away to smell perfumes i kept driving too fast on the way there would realize and then would have to slow down i ended up buying three perfumes which werent cheap and now im broke then all day today im researching perfume im trying to find out a way to buy more or plotting when im going to buy more then the fact that i couldnt buy one like now made me really upset and i started to feel like i could cry or the hint of depression this happened twice but i bobbed out of it thankfully its like i cant stop thinking about it im not having any pressured speech and my thoughts arent as fast and confused as they have been before its just very one tracked obsessive thinking is this sounding like hypomania because im worried maybe it is but i mean i think i seem pretty calm despite which makes me think no im just being dramatic and weird im still taking 5mg zyprexa i went down from 10mg so maybe im just having symptoms from that and i need to ride it out to adjust i really want to get off zyprexa try out lamictal so should i be worried or is this just something that happens from cutting back on an antipsychotic is it giving me hypomania idk thoughts on this anyone im starting to think i might be having a problem,post-pandemic

ive been in recovery since april 2023 and was doing mostly okay slow improvements but was eating sufficiently consistently challenging fear foods and expanding my diet plus i finished weight restoring in july or so things have been slowly getting sketchier for a month or two and ive been really struggling for the past month still nowhere near the danger zone of when i was engaging in all my behaviors at high intensity but my consistency and sufficiency of eating has gone to shit and my intake is a bit more than half of what i was having before plus im engaging in some other behaviors a ton again calorie counting some excessive exercise delaying meals etc usually one or both of my days off are better but my workdays in particular have been abysmal since im very active for my commute and for the job itself its a busy workplace and its easy just to not make time to eat for those of you whove experienced this at what point did your outpatient dietician refer you to something like iop im scared my dietician is going to get fed up with the fact that i keep having shitty week after shitty week and say that i need more help which i cant really access right now i dont want to fuck myself over,post-pandemic
when i was a kid i always got the highest grades without even having to move a finger because i already either knew everything from class or i was interested in said topics and studied them by myself unfortunately when i entered high school that did not work out teachers would set exam dates and everybody would be spending hours upon hours just studying i tried to do that but i just couldnt i just couldnt focus for more than 5 minutes on studying something unless its something that interests me then the exams happen and id just have a lot of anxiety and be unable to complete anything even the things i did know instead of trying to help me every time i asked a teacher or a tutor they always just told me to try harder or to stop being lazy even though i already am trying and i am not being lazy i just straight up cant this is still going on for me and im pretty sure i am going to fail this weeks math exams i managed to learn the theory but i cannot put it in practice well and i just start blanking during exams causing me to fail so my school is trying to make me redo the exam its the third time ill have done it until i manage to learn it even though i do know the topic but i cant do shit im tired is there anything i can do,post-pandemic

hello first off thanks to anyone who reads my very long post i dont have expectations that anyone will read it but if someone does it will make my day maybe itll just be a nice little story to entertain you i guess ill mention im a 26m living in the us if that matters so basically ive been struggling with loneliness a lot lately its always bothered me but if never really bothered me before i was in a ldr with a girl a couple months ago that we met through a game online and she eventually broke up with me due to reasons on her end ever since the breakup it really opened my eyes as to how lonely i really am that tiny period of time where i had someone to talk to everyday and showed affection towards me felt really good and now that its gone im struggling very hard ive never had a true irl friend but i do have a close online friend group that i talk to just about everyday but not all of them are always online or want to talk i probably always seem annoying to them as ill send tons of messages in the group chat because im bored and lonely while they all have multiple groups that they hang out with and i just have the one they are great guys though were very close and have known each other for 6 years so ever since the breakup ive been desperately searching for a new relationship friends over the past few weeks ive tried messaging at least a hundred people to start a friendship or even just a small chat while unsurprisingly people have only reached out to me a couple times it feels like i always have to do the initiating of convos nobody bats an eye towards me unless i start talking to them and then it just seems like im bothering them nobody every comes to me to chat i like to consider myself a nice guy and i actually care to listen about your interests and dont mind chatting throughout the whole day just getting a notification that someone sent me a message feels like winning the lottery one of my hobbies is that i twitch stream make youtube videos im not famous by any means but i do have a small following i have people tune into my stream every week and can get up to 50 live viewers at once people even know my name within the community i stream in and ive been recognized before so oddly enough it seems like people do want to see me and show interest in me but nobody will go past that into friendship level which i dont understand am i just super ugly just unbearably annoying i cant seem to figure out the answer just feels like i basically have to beg people to talk to me feels like i always have to put so much effort into trying to get friends and everyone just ignores or doesnt care and i cant figure out why im not rude im not a bum i always try to be the nicest i can i listen to others yet the feeling of being unwanted keeps growing,post-pandemic

yesterday it was a bad surf session triggered by comparing my performance with others today it was because the waves were too big for me to ride i told myself i was lucky to even have the time and opportunity to surf it eventually gets better with conscious effort to change my perspective but then some other small inconvenience comes up and restarts the cycle i want a technique to make it not start in the first place i dont want to die right now but i cant stop thinking how comfortable it would be to give up i hate myself when i feel sorry for myself which results in this crazy internal struggle which overwhelms me and makes me want to give up any help will be appreciated thanks,pre-pandemic

it has been a few years since i went to treatment and been in recovery etc ive been pretty stable since but of course have had a few small lapses the last few months have been a bit of a struggle though anyways a big thing in treatment and that i see on recovery accounts is challenging fear foods i never have had specific fear foods i will eat only junk food as long as i stay below a certain calorie limit i actually know my ed is creeping around again when i stop eating a good variety of healthy foods and switch to a mostly junk food diet to me it feels like well if i am going to eat something and since i know it will be limited i want to actually have it be something worthwhile wondering if anyone else has this experience because throughout the years this is what has made me feel like my ed is invalid or that i dont actually even have one,post-pandemic

what the title is in a nutshell right now im feeling like i need to quit my job and just run away from my entire life and start something new i have a fairly decent life other than bipolar but i cant shake this feeling right now,pre-pandemic
sorry for the wordy title i dont know how else to put it i keep on going through this cycle usually after having a good couple of days ill suddenly become really positive and motivated to throw myself into recovery and make my life as good as i possibly can i make mental plans about trying even harder in therapy improving my eating habits getting a good sleeping pattern exercising more saving money investing time in my hobbies getting organised going back to work with a perfect attendance record having perfect relationships with people and not wasting a single second of my days at the time it feels like its all possible and ive cracked the code to being mentally healthy im ready to put 100 effort into it all and then a few days later or however long it takes my mindset completely changes suddenly i just dont care about any of that stuff and achieving even a single one of the goals i thought about seems impossible the motivation turns to nothing and i feel like im never going to change even if i try to do so i almost laugh at my past self for being so hopeful because it feels ridiculous now id rather just waste my time away until it runs out rinse and repeat dae,pre-pandemic

hi all for background i am currently a freshman in college and just officially got diagnosed with adhd finally a few months ago however i have been diagnosed with bipolar ii for a few years now a nonverbal learning disability and anxiety and depression since middle school long story short i was denied a single dorm for college this year and i was super pissed i provided 2 letters by my psychiatrist and psychologist saying that my moods will make it uncomfortable for me to have a roommate due to the unpredictability of my mental disorders and needing private space to not be seen when i am struggling i am again seeking medicaldisability housing at my college for me a single dorm which i was denied for this academic year i am wondering if there are any fair housing protections for people with adhd like some other psychiatric conditions their committees excuse was that they dont provide freshman with single dorms no exceptions come to find out several people i know who had roommate problems easily switched rooms to singles from minor disputes and a boatload of students from one dorm got evacuated into spare singles and doubles because of a mold issue now with my adhd diagnosis i also put on my form for next year that the distractibility of a roommate and our differing sleep schedules really throws off my ability to be sufficiently rested and thus impacts my concentration and mood if they dont approve me to guarantee me a single next year i am considering trying to take legal action has anyone else had a similar situation and if so is there a law that will protect someone with adhd to have fair housing,post-pandemic
im on mobile so cant link to my other post but youll see my initial post about this a few months ago in my history to sum up about 78 months ago i began getting dizzy spells out of the blue vertigo and then a constant feeling of swayingoff balance i flipped out my ha was through the roof i saw three doctors who diagnosed me with some inner ear problem and assured me it would go away eventually i didnt believe them though and was convinced i had a brain tumour or ms or something the anxiety destroyed me i couldnt sleep eat enjoy life i was suicidal at one point because i just felt panicky all the time and couldnt stand the feeling of being off balance sometimes there were triggers for it sometimes it just happened it was every day though and caused me so much stress after 3 months i got an mri bloodwork and ct scan i was terrified but glad i got them they all came back normal it was such a relief i went to see a vestibular physiotherapist who performed some tests and agreed with the doctors that it was an inner ear issue he thinks bppv he told me that everyone heals at a different rate and to do exercises to help retrain my brain to not get dizzy so easily its been around 78 months since this started and things are a lot better its not gone but the exercises helped a lot and i no longer fear the dizzy sensation all the time if i had just trusted my doctors in the first place with their initial diagnosis i couldve saved myself so much grief and pain im going to do my best from now on to listen to what they say and stay off google i have successfully avoided this even though ive had other small health scares pop up ive learned that the less i talk about it ideally not at all and with no googlebody scanning that the anxiety comes and goes quickly anyways just wanted to post this for anyone else who may have similar symptoms all was normal with me and it very likely is for you too obviously check with a doctor if youre unsure but if they tell you youre fine then you are oh and the anxiety absolutely made my symptoms way worse it would sometimes happen on its own but once i stopped obsessing over it all the time it was far more mild and less frequent,pre-pandemic
since i really dont know who to share it with i came to the united states almost 5 years ago when i was 18 with just 1000 in my pocket it was just me who decided to leave everything behind and my family is still in vietnam right now i live with my relatives in an illinois surb started to do nails illegally to support my needs because i was an international student so instead of paying 9k a semester like other illinois residents i had to pay almost 18k a semester and life has been too hard since i moved here i know you will ask me why your family in vietnam doesnt support you well because my dad and my mom have been unemployed and i still have 2 younger sisters going to college right now i decided to come here because first ill be able to work to help my family second i love the education here and third this is the only way because to be honest if i were still in vietnam now i wouldnt know how my family would survive so one of my uncle in california decided to help me with the visa process to come here after a few months his wife was diagnosed with a really bad depression so i had to move to illinois with my other uncle he owns a nail salon so i started to work for him his wife doesnt like me because according to what she said to my family in vietnam i dont know how to sugarcoat things to make people feel better she straight up said to my moms face who has 3 daughters that she rather not have any kids than have a daughter well i guess thats why she still doesnt have any kids now she spread rumors about how i tried to hook up with several female coworkers of my salon just because she knows im a lesbian and they are all in their 50s and im 23 she talks shit about me with literally anyone i can think of she ignores me she has attitudes with me every time im around her i see her 247 oh my god plus recently my uncle took 3k from their bank account to gamble and because he doesnt want his wife to find out he told her that he took out that money so i can borrow it like you add fuel to a big fire the atmosphere whenever im around her has been giving me some of the worst anxieties ive ever had and the fact that im really easy to get lonely hurt doesnt help at all life has been hell and even though im going to college right now its so hard to make friends because its a commute school and i would have to take a train to go back immediately for work after the last class i cant move out because i cant afford that right now i cant vent with my family because i dont want them to worry but my life has been like this for almost 5 years and its just so hard and lonely sounds stupid but i masterbate almost every night to feel that little spark and as always i feel miserable right after just did it and i caught myself looking at the ceiling bawling my eyes out because how pathetic i felt its hard to sum up those 5 years in a post but its more than you could imagine,post-pandemic

im not an antivaxxer and i dont believe vaccines cause autism and im not asking for a vaccine debate my 4 year old son is autistic this is just a thought i had earlier today that i had never considered before and am now curious about i tried posting the question on raskreddit 3 times but it was removed each time because of how i phrased it each time which wasnt good enough to start a topic of discussion for them i am sincerely interested if there are any cases of non vaccinated people that deal with autism in their lives im interested in learning if there are cases of people like this and why its never brought into the debate as an example,pre-pandemic
im writing a story and a big part of it focuses on mental health in varying forms i want to include a character with schizophrenia but i dont have schizophrenia and i dont know anyone with it so i thought here would be the best place to ask about how i should go about portraying it and for recommendations on the best sources for good information for added context the character i am making is not a villain nor a bad person im also not trying to make his entire character about schizophrenia i just want to know how i should incorporate it into his character naturally without it feeling forced misrepresented or like a spectacle whilst also being able to discuss problems that may arise because of it telling me about anything i should or shouldnt include would be great id really appreciate recommendations for good videos articles books ect on schizophrenia that i could use as references id love to be better informed on this and i know i could look things up but i really dont want to get false information on this subject so i thought asking here for more details would be safer then trusting whatever i find on google,post-pandemic
i would like to hear your advice i am 19 years old i always used to have addictive tendencies i tried many substances however i never got strongly addicted to one now i dont do anything not even weed or alcohol everything i do has a kind of compulsive drive as if i cling on something even healthy things such as reading sports writing drawing i have chronic pain 247 tension headaches and mental health problems currently i am on deprivation from porn sex and heavy unnecessary social media use i really dont know what to do with my time now like i cant always read listen to audiobooks go for walks do sports or bodyawareness exercises these are good for me and i enjoy it but its just too much doing more would feel compulsive i dont know what to put my energy in i feel like im bursting without anything to do might be the dopamine deprivation but anyways i got to do something just what anything like writing drawing reading ect feels like im only doing it because ive got nothing else to do it feels compulsive like im filling a void also i really dont feel like meeting new people or a lot of people i dont have a social problem its just a life period of introspection calm and reorientation on my needs and interests additionally i made the decision to no longer search for someone or something specific in terms of relationships that just adds stress and decreases intimacy in this topic of my life i just let happen whatever happens also i cant spend more time just being with the moment feeling everything the moment offers this is very difficult with my conditions and as i mentioned already plus im doing that enough probably too much already i feel like all this time i have for sensing my body and myself is making me odd its just too much for my age i need to do something but i dont know what any advice,post-pandemic

is it normal to not be consciously anxiousnot having any anxious thoughts when physical symptoms start most of my panic attacks stem from feeling a physical symptom of anxiety ie heart palpitations shortness of breath dizziness etc and then me worrying about it i thought this was normal but it seems like most people are consciously anxious when they feel those symptoms just trying to make sure what im experiencing is normal here,post-pandemic

my brother adam died at the age of 23 years old in 2018 he lost the battle to addiction after seven years of being a drug addict adam had the best laugh it was loud boisterous he was tall handsome daring and charming eight years my junior i grew up watching him come into his own i remember him putting on magic shows in the living room one time he wanted to hold my hand on the roller coaster when he was scared adam wanted reassurance that he wasnt too old for that as any big sister would i told him of course it was okay as time went on i grew to be the worrier of the family adam grew up to be a total daredevil jumping off the stratosphere in vegas flying a hot air balloon with my dad and living his life in the fast lane my brother was the kind of guy that grabbed life by the horns and stared fear in the face with a smirk i used to think of him as a cat with many lives because no matter what happened he always came out of the situation unscathed he became a drug addict slowly but with warning signs in the end it seemed like he was overdosing every other day the calls from rehabs and hospitals were relentless the year before he died my parents got a call from california encouraging us all to fly out there he overdosed and his numbers were horrible in this dark time we all prepared to say goodbye to him miraculously he landed on his feet yet again this time the overdose had consequences he passed out on his hands and this caused serious nerve damage he couldnt use his hands for a while but with his first hand surgery he acclimated quite well the doctors said his hands wouldnt recover and that the damage was permanent after about six months he started to get movement back in his hand and to our surprise were told hed make a full recovery i remember him sending me a video of him moving his hands i sat there in awe crying happy tears surely this will all make him wake up and stop using i thought i hoped in times like this hope is the only thing that really gets you through every time something catastrophic happened this was my mindset we never quite got the whole story but i knew things werent looking good he seemed to be spinning faster towards danger and i felt angry that there wasnt a damn thing i could do to stop it in the year or so before he passed away my friend kate who had lost her dad to alcoholism told me to prepare myself for the worst she said she had wished she accepted the fact that he could die before it happened maybe just maybe if i could do that it would help me in the long run i reluctantly took her advice i sat down in my office and really thought about what she said i cried for what felt like forever this harsh but valuable insight from my dear friend helped me beyond words every time i saw my brother i acted as if it could be the last time this has brought me a great amount of peace looking back on things i dont have regrets of what i could have done because i know for sure i tried everything tough love soft love and everything in between of course none of it worked so there is a part of me that feels defeated who am i to impart any wisdom on others there is great peace in being able to look back on things with a clear conscience i never looked at addiction through rose colored glasses i saw it exactly for what it was no matter how difficult it was i remember begging on the phone to his rehab not to let him out because i was worried hed overdose and die i was told there was nothing they can do to keep him there it was his choice to leave id be on the phone from morning to night fighting for answers i spent hours talking to him about his addiction trying to understand it and help him in any way i could i suggested everything i could possibly think of and was there for him anytime he called me id take his calls even when i suspected he was high sometimes hed make no sense and ask for money other times the adam i knew and loved was just calling to say hi i never missed one of those calls most importantly i spent as much time as possible with him and always hugged him extra tight before i left i told him how much i loved him and cherished every second if i had not done this i know for sure id look back with regret something i wasnt prepared for was how permanent death is he flew home from rehab in california and i saw him the day before he died he was back in town to get surgery on his other hand i remember him standing in the driveway on my way out i told him again for the millionth time not to use especially before or after his surgery he agreed not to and i told him i loved him we hugged and i got into my car that was the last time i saw my brother i wanted to write this open letter to anyone that will read it to those who are suffering with addiction and the families around them please know that you are not alone i grew up in the middle class we had a nice house on a culdesac we were taught to love each other no one would have expected what was going on in our lives i want to share a few words of wisdom i have learned along the way take it as you will to those of you in the beginning stages of grief hold on i know you feel like youre drowning and cant catch your breath you will breathe again i promise in the beginning my family took everything ten seconds at a time i cried for months in grocery store lines there were long periods of time where i woke up crying and i went to bed crying i could hardly catch my breath please hang on we had an outreach of support from friends and family in the darkest time of our lives i encourage you to reach out to those that love you and let them take care of you when you need it cry your eyes out i used to hate crying until i realized how healing it is lets be honest i still hate it but i can recognize its undeniable benefits to process grief you have to feel the emotions behind it i promise you wont cry forever crying is good for you and is so incredibly tiring cry yourself to sleep bring tissues everywhere you go and allow yourself to feel whatever it is youre feeling in the moment to anyone suffering with addiction please know you are loved and you are not alone i want you to know that losing a family member to this is the hardest thing ive ever had to do its been a year and a half and i still cry every single day please do everything you can to take the addiction seriously and to get support in any way you can addiction is something a person is suffering with it does not define who they are its easy to judge an addict until you have walked the same path offer kindness and love to the addict instead of judgment that addict is someones family member or best friend all im saying is love goes a lot farther than judgment as humans we are all suffering in some way it makes the world a much better place to offer encouragement love and understanding to a person to families and friends of addicts i see you i know how painful and hard it is to watch someone you love go further down the rabbit hole its a hopeless devastating feeling i wouldnt wish on anyone i try to openly share my story with others you would not believe the amount of people who are dealing with the exact same thing we feel like we need to hide in the shadows because its embarrassing to discuss trust me i get it please remember none of us choose this its something that unfortunately happens way more than it should to those reading this thank you for taking the time to listen to what i have to say i miss my brother every single second of every single day sometimes when i close my eyes i can still hear his laugh on the really tough days that gets me through and to my brother adam fly high i will never forget you allison,pre-pandemic

ive been struggling with a horrible anxiety flareup for the past 7 weeks ive made plenty of other posts if you want more details basically its hit a new peak this past week it started after my family left for a camping trip and i went to stay with some friends ive had the im gonna die feeling and the other physical symptoms since this started but they began feeling worse eventually after hours of struggling on saturday i had a panic attack much worse than my previous two i actually thought i was going to die i ended up passing out from hyperventilating and drinking too much water leading to dangerously low salt levels and having a seizure ending up in the hospital im still traumatized from the experience i was literally just with the doctor yesterday he told me i was fine and not to worry about my heart that should be enough to get rid of this feeling but despite all the times im told that im not dying i still fucking feel like im dying and it gets worse every day its hard for me to describe i get extremely dissociated and feel like im watching an artificial version of my life on a tv screen and its scary because my brain thinks im drifting away from reality its like my life is the show and my body and brain hate watching it so theyre trying to turn it off this combined with the physical symptoms heart palpitations numbness chest tightness trouble breathing shakiness nausea popping ears head pressure diarrhea lightheadedness dizziness left arm pain blurred and sometimes distorted vision intrusive thoughts and overanalyzing every tiny fucking little feeling creates this constant feeling that i am about to pass out or die i dont know what to do it keeps getting worse every day im not able to go to the store anymore i cant get sleep because im scared of dying in my sleep im tired of being told distract yourself by watching tv or go outside as if that will magically cure me i can never do the breathing exercises or meditation because of how difficult it is for me to breathe steadily i try my hardest to ignore it and move on to something else but it is just so crippling and on top of this i convienientely caught a cold today so i get many more feelings to overanalyze im going to go to therapy soon once i find a good plan the hospital took me off of prozac but i did start adavan recently sorry for the long rant im just totally hopeless and scared,pre-pandemic
i want help i really do but i dont have any money so what i just sit here and wait for things to go off the rails so far i can put them back on track my desire to be better just cant compete against the straight fact that unless you can afford it theres no help for you not to be funny but it just makes me more confident im not gonna make it to 40 making it this far was hard enough without help it just feels impossible,post-pandemic

this isnt like exactly a new coping mechanism its just a different take on already existing ones my take on this particular style of coping mechanism is something i call wram sheets or written access memory sheets this one is more of a personal coping mechanism i came up with for myself because i have zero memory and i have a hard time remembering even just a single idea in my head which is not something i can really afford to have happen with something thats considered more critical so what i started doing is taking a sheet of paper and using that to make a wram sheet by writing critical ideas i need to remember but cant seem to memorize i keep it beside me at my desk so throughout the day i might look at it to see if theres anything i need to remember as im going along with my life for example i like to write and have dozens of projects i tentatively want to work on and frequently change ideas around of what i want to do and what i feel ill actually do im a very indecisive person so i often lose sight of one project in favor for another so with the wram sheet i write what my objectives and executive decisions are when it comes to all the projects im making i have a few lines that read stick with story1 for now or do story2 later or on the side or story3 is for personal purposes only when i have so many projects im tentatively considering that are all interconnected with each other this has been very useful to me as a coping mechanism i say all this but the reality is this coping mechanism hasnt been as effective for me as i had hoped it to be but it has worked pretty well for what it was intended for i plan on trying to refine this idea moving ahead and i hope if you dont find this particular coping mechanism to be useful in your life that maybe you might still find some ideas or inspiration on how you can choose to navigate your life as well,post-pandemic

for any health professionals who have a mental health condition perhaps you can relate commiserate a few months ago i started to suspect i had bipolar ii i was going through a particularly rough patch in my personal life and the depressive and hypomanic episodes were becoming obvious i was struggling and decided to confide in a friendcolleague without saying a word to me about it this colleague decided to report me to my boss she had health concerns relating to the issues i was having in my private life not my work next thing i know my boss calls me into a meeting wont tell me what has been said about me colleagues confidentiality is important but wants to ensure i am seeking treatment for these health concerns i am ive been seeing a psychologist for years am on antidepressants and ive been trying to seek support from friends i feel pretty shattered by this exposure vulnerability at work i seek a voluntary hospital admission to keep myself safe and hopefully to be reviewed and started on mood stabilizers nurses and doctors in the hospital didnt want to consider bipolar because starting meds is something that should be done as an outpatient apparently they ignore what im telling them and label me with borderline instead after hospital i managed to find a psychiatrist get properly diagnosed and medicated things started looking up i was stable healthy picking up the pieces three months later i get a call from the psychology board that colleague had not only made my diagnosis public at work but had also reported me to the psychology board so theyre now going to conduct an investigation into my mental health the case worker tells me that they cant tell me what has been said again colleagues confidentiality is important but they need indepth letters from all my treating physicians outlining things like my familydevelopmental history etc so that they can decide whether im a risk to the public oh and they are currently looking through all my medical records they apparently dont need my consent they will simply access my hospital records and sift through every sensitive personal issue i have ever divulged during treatment thinking this would be confidential while scrutinizing whether i can continue my career in case im not being completely honest in my statement this news has an awesome effect on my mental health and now i continue to wait on the outcome of their investigation wondering what strangers on the board are going to learn intimate details about my complex trauma history wondering how my income and livelihood is going to be affected i feel like the lesson out of all this is that as a psychologist im not allowed to have a mental health condition or if i do i need to keep it to myself so that im not publicly exposed judged punished i feel like i dont have supports or therapists any more yeah ill turn up to sessions because i have to but how can i be anything other than good now i dont have a right to privacy how disappointing to be treated so harshly by the very profession ive dedicated almost a decade of training to being treated like a threat to public safety rather than somebody whos going through something seeking support feeling shellshocked,pre-pandemic

i havent eaten in two days he knew he mentioned a grilled cheese and tomato soup one of my all time favorites i reluctantly agreed my stomach growled loudly when he mentioned it so he made me a grilled cheese and some soup he heated up my safe tomato soup used 0 cal cooking spray instead of butter like he usually does and just made a baby sandwich one slice of bread cut in half it was more than i had planned on eating but he did everything he could to make it safer for me without me even asking he isnt perfect but damn this feels like a victory for both of us in a weird way,pre-pandemic

i should note i did stop taking my lamictal a couple days ago bla bla bla i know prior to taking it i was never even that bad my doctor was hesitant to even put me on it i dont have a history of intense bipolar behavior the diagnosis itself is debated anyways today someone at work paged me to call them and put their number on the page to dial i call them no answer i send them a chat on teams later a co worker comes to me and goes have you finished with client xyz i said no because jane told me to call her before we talked to that client my coworker was confused cus we all use the same pager number and he never got that message i go to pull it up on mine and i dont see it on the pager im like wait i swear it was here i look at other peoples pagers it doesnt exist but it had very specific instructions to not engage with that client before i call her im starting to feel crazy so i look at my phone log and it says at 110pm i dialed out to her i would only have called her like if she sent me a page to do so because i do not have her number otherwise so to me im thinking obviously i did get a page because theres no other way id have found and dialed her number i go to her office a few hours later and shes like i saw your message on teams sorry i was out of office i say did you page me to talk to you about clientx and she goes no so when i get back to my own office i look at the call log again the 110 call is not on record anymore i am a very frazzled and forgetful person and i mix things up a lot but this felt different i had such a clear memory of the page what it said and of seeing my recorded call at 110 all gone and its scary cus it actually affected my work i didnt call a client and i told a co worker a made up reason why i have zero history of delusions nothing even close is this a withdrawal thing its scary how real it felt pls spare me the take your medsnonsense theres nuance to this situation,post-pandemic

christmas i passed out and embarrassed myself 2 days later i decided enough was enough and after 20 years of dedicated drunkenness i stopped drinking its been 47 days and ive been eating like a horse and drinking cases of iced tea and club soda regular seltzer i am actually finding the stop drinking subs depressing and anxiety inducing at the moment people much younger than me people who drank considerably less than me the health problems and relationship problems that i somehow avoided for now have been catching up to them i keep getting this feeling like even though i put the work in for the first time in my adult life that its still eventually going to catch up to me this maybe irrational feeling that it makes sense to give up and just succumb to the inevitable awful feeling so yeah i think im going to thank everyone for their support and tap out for a while o dont know,post-pandemic
so i dont know why but i know i was behaving very oddly walking around my apartment complex i got lost in my own complex a police officer showed up i guess someone called him because of me and started asking me a bunch of questions i was in psychosis but he may have thought something else was wrong so he wants me to take him to my apartment i go in im soooo out of it but this is where it really saves my ass i didnt realize it but i walked into the wrong fucking apartment it took me and even the officer a few minutes to figure out what was wrong i was 2 buildings down from my apartment nobody was there even though i heard people in their rooms the police officer figures this out and immediate starts asking how much did you have to drink today and i somehow remembered my schizophrenia medical alert card that i ordered when it got popular on this sub a few weeks ago i handed it to him and he made a face like uhh whats this but as soon as he saw it was a med id his whole demeanor automatically changed he became a lot more relaxed and understanding he just said come on lets get you home and walked with me and made sure i got home safely im so thankful for this card this interaction could have been so much worse i highly recommend getting one i never thought it would actually help me so much link to buy card link to get a card for free note that it takes a lot more time to get the card for free also if you can afford to buy it you should so that they can keep giving free ones to those who cant hugs edit wow thank you for the gold and silver,pre-pandemic
hello all as indicated im getting ready to go to another province for national winter games in a couple of weeks it is super exciting ive been looking forward to it for a long time and two days ago we got our uniforms these games are always very exciting and well worth looking forward to i have noticed something interesting ive been having a hell of a time trying to sleep at night though i am on 250 xr quetiapine solution take some instant release stuff not a problem so i take 50 ir with the xr to try and induce sleep well normally it makes me very tired and difficult to waking up at morning it is making me feel a bit drowsy but it is nowhere near as intense as it usually is its making me tired enough to try and get a little bit of sleep though i have to work in the morning so i dont want to take any more than i need to lol hypomania perhaps but i also feel calm and levelheaded like i dont feel hostile to others or have for flight of ideas happening or any of my usual warning signs let me know what you think,post-pandemic
ive been with this man for 3 years and we are now 28 when i first met him he was holding down a good swe job doing okay with his finances so i didnt realize that his drug use was alarming also because im from a country that doesnt have hard drugs so i naively believed since he still had a job the drug use was just fun i realized after a while that taking 20 dabs a day 7 lines of ketamine at a time snorting adderall every day just to be able to do 1 hour of work and drinking to the point of blackout every other day is not normal fast forward to now over the past year ive watched him lose his job and struggle to find another one for a year and 3 months despite having an electrical engineering degree from a top ivy league and all the resources at his disposal i watched him get a barback job and fall into using cocaine and adderall just to stay up at the job he started drinking more and more i would find bottles of whiskey 1l empty within a couple days any time things didnt feel good he would do drugs and i realized he was also hiding how much ketamine he was doing i tried again and again to help him be soberhe would cry to me that he wants to be sober and i tried to get him to wake up early and apply to jobs eat healthy take vitamins and get his life together but every time id end up crying because he disappeared for 16 hours yet again because of this hes beeninhumanely cruel to me hes gone between telling me he loves me and im the only oneto me finding out he was cheating again this weekend when i confronted him he did not open his door and actually seduced the other girl while i was standing right outside sobbing it wasto say the least the most cruel and awful thing i have ever endured so i contacted his mom knowing hed be mad at me about this bc they dont have a good relationship i didnt know what else to do i told her her son is not okay and he really needs help either rehab or form his family bc i cant help him anymore then after 3 days of no response at all he returned saying that he wanted to explain the cheating but now he cant because i did the irreversible egregious act of telling his mom he never apologized for cheating and destroying me and even said he only cheated bc he was triggered by a german guy that reminded me of a guy you slept with once when we werent together he says he has no choice but to end it since i told his parents and they will take him out of the will if he continues to see me i feel so guilty i feel like i did the worst thingi cant stop crying wondering did i go too far maybe i should have tried to get him into aa first maybe his addiction isnt as bad as i thought i have so many doubts and guilt am i the asshole for telling his mom so she could help get him sober,post-pandemic
ive always wanted to have a strong friendship with someone like i did before i started to slip into this world of bpd and mental illness but anytime im given the opportunity to make a friend i fuck it up by bailing on them ghosting them etc because im so unhappy with myself that i dont want to burden anyone else with my issues i also have ptsd from an old friendship that still bothers me to this day so it makes me even more idgaf towards maintaining a friendship i hate myself so much and i hate that i treat people in this manor i dont say rude things to people i just completely isolate myself instead and ignore everything around me i met a super sweet girl whos bipolar and like legit my twin but i cant even maintain a friendship with her because i barely have enough energy for myself and i dont know if this is me selfsabotaging i feel so bad because she wants to hangout and talk so much and all i do is ignore her like the asshole i unintentionally make myself out to be,pre-pandemic

i see how people could find it addictive but i always thought it was always a little too short i prefer longer in depth videos or reading reddit posts i tend to obsess over topics and like to do deep research obsession short videos are good for like watching cat videos but nothing else i find it lacking depth or any explanation i also dislike how random it feels even once the algorithm gets to know you i prefer videos around 15 minutes long it seems perfect not long enough to get bored but not too short either,post-pandemic
i suffer from ptsd and anxiety disorder with bouts of depression ive developed this through my time in the military due to things i have endured or witnessed although most are noncombat related i came here to seek a community of those who can understand what im going through upon coming here i so often see people start their posts with im not in the military or referring to their lack of military service as invalidating their ptsd ive read enough of those statements to motivate me to come here and say one simple thing your ptsd is valid stop feeling the need to defend your traumatic experiences when comparing them to military members with ptsd your trauma is no less real than what i experienced my uniform does not strengthen my need for ptsd treatment any more or less than any of you many of you nonmilitary ptsd sufferers have gone through things much worse than i or many other people in the military you are valid your ptsd is real your trauma happened and you deserve treatment and support and most of all you will heal see you all on the other side thanks for being americans worth fighting and dying for thanks for being nonamericans worth serving and fighting for thanks for being good people,pre-pandemic
ive been on concerta 54mg for the past 6 months and i can definitely feel a difference but im not sure how much of my behavior is a product of improper medication or just a lack of willpower for example i am in my senior year of college and know that i struggle with time management and procrastination however i still drop the ball on projects due to lack of focus and most recently i holed up in my room for 2 weeks ignoring my responsibilities because i couldnt stop watching scandal and playing tennis clash on my ipad lol concerningly this is actually an improvement from when i was not medicated can anyone who is on concerta or has taken it in the past lmk what your experiencetrajectory was like i want to know if i should be thinking of increasing my dose trying a different med like vyvanse or if my concerta is working as it should be and i just lack discipline lol,post-pandemic

hey all this is my first actual post on this subreddit but ive been struggling bp 2 and all of your posts really help me feel like i can figure this out ive had a really bad bout of depression recently though it tends to get mixed with my hypomanic episodes in a weird way but im happy to say ive gotten a job ive been off of work and struggling to graduate for the last year or so and everyones posts have really helped me get the gumption to get up and try when things get hard i just wanted to thank everyone i dont know anyone close to me with bp so this subreddit has been my secret place to read when things get tough and i know people wont get it if i try to explain it i really credit reading everyones experiences with giving me the gumption to believe i can do it apply for jobs and then get myself out of bed and dress for the interview thank you again everyone as indirect as it was i really appreciate everyone for posting and the mods for putting it all together things got hard and i didnt think i was good enough for anything and you guys gave me perspective and enough just keep trying to get through it thank you,pre-pandemic
i recently found out i have bpd and to be blunt i havent been taking it well i had my suspicions about having it and i was aware of all of my symptoms but finding out that i actually had bpd has been so brain fogging i have been laying in bed all day not bothering to check my phone i can barely sleep and im completely thrown off routine suddenly everything that i knew i wasnt alone in i feel that i am everything i read about bpd i relate with but the worst part is that many people talk about it like there is no hope im aware of there being no cure im just scared that ill be stuck like this forever therapy isnt really accepted in my family and everything i see about bpd sounds like i have to go to therapy or else i wont get better i guess my reason for this is just looking for a little hope advice or someone who can be brutally honest how do i deal with this how do i move on how do i learn to live with it and not fight with it,post-pandemic

i want to get better at waking up early because im going to need to do so for my job and tbh it helps me be organized and get a headstart on the day but that means i might get hungrier during the day im not going to get the same amount of sleep because of the type of job and it scares me even more but i gotta get accustomed to this holy shit dude tell me who in here could relate please,post-pandemic
last fall my therapist diagnosed me with adhd officially after ive been having issues with focus and panic attacks i was having trouble completing tasks after a major promotion that i frankly didnt want couple of months later go in for my annual checkup and my doctor after completing the mental health screening thingy is like are you okay you need to get a new job its clear you are not yourself i tell her whats been happening and that my therapist diagnosed me as adhd she said she wanted me to try a low dose ritalin but that i needed to get officially diagnosed as my therapist was out of network speak to another therapist who stops the test halfway through the screening literally texts the head of the psych department for the hospital saying that my answers on the test are pointing more towards complex ptsd and that the adhd could be part of it but not the cause and that she wouldnt sign off on an adhd diagnosis so i can keep getting meds which were helping so she stops the test and says i need edmr therapy my primary therapist and physician are pissed because the second therapist is jamming up the works and taking my issues out of context ive been going to my therapist for 7 years and she is aware of my issues and has been trying to treat all of my issues holistically what do i do to keep getting my meds and keep my diagnosis i dont disagree that i probably have complex ptsd but i know that i have adhd this second therapist is really being a problem,post-pandemic
so at work today it was optional pajama day but i couldnt wear any because after my sudden weight drop none of them fit me so when i get in my boss was like wheres your pajamas so i told her none of mine fit me anymore and she got confused and asked why and ive been trying to be a little more open about whats been going on without seeking treatment tho and so i just got quiet and said because of my anorexia she got quiet for a minute then was like ok lets go to target and i just said oh no i dont have the money for target and she was like doesnt matter lets go there i just got a pair of toy story pants and when i went to pay she paid for me and looked at me and just said everyone deserves clothes that fit them at least it meant so much to me that shed go above and beyond like that for me just wanted to share a nice story from my sometimes lame workplace,pre-pandemic
i get gassy crampy and sometimes full on runs just from being anxious my stomach will hurt and occasionally ill get heartburn only when im highly anxious i just wondered if anyone else gets this and cant think of anywhere id be more comfortable asking edit wow this blew up i had no idea this was such a common thing,pre-pandemic
if i had a gun it would be easier but my only options all require pain i just have to get past the pain part and ill be good to go edit i really dont care for what comes after i die i just know that its better than dealing with whats here for me trust me ive tried my best to keep moving forward in this world but its all been pointless i have no fear of being dead i just struggle with the natural human instinct of fearingavoiding pain if theres one thing in this life that im sure of its that i want to die and its not a fleeting thought i think about it the majority of every day the fact that so many individuals in the comments feel similarly is heartbreaking some of us are not fortunate or strong enough to go on living some of us have been beat down by life one too many times i wish that was not the case but unfortunately it is its really saddening to see but i sympathize because i feel the same,pre-pandemic
first of all i have a psychiatrist and a psychologist the latters wonderful and former not so much i am still in my late teens and have thus far gone undiagnosed probably because its unusual i guess for most of my life ive had hyperfocus objectively even on stuff i despised i was able to hyperfocus simply on interest but recently have become more and more unfocused i constantly have a voice inside my head talking with me i always read reciting words in my head and am unable to not do so i also recite sounds inside my head which includes people talkingand even myself and i am stupidly spontaneous it even surprises me how i am able to do these things the first 3 ive mentioned and the fact i cannot listen to anyone if im washing hands or eating an appleor anything crunchy because the sound is just too loud in my head also lead me to believe towards this i guess my head just echoes sounds it may be something else i dont know ive never seen this listed anywhere so im going towards what seems to be the closest to my case thank you in advance,post-pandemic
of course it hasnt been perfect but no day is i woke up feeling good i had 3 meals my pod system arrived so no more used cigarettes or disposables i crocheted something for the first time in ages i watched a few interesting yt videos went to 2 meetings both of which were quite fulfilling i prayed for the first time too to myself or whatevers out there who knows also wrote down some quotes and prayers in a little booklet that ill be carrying with me places im learning how to prevent myself from catastrophizing and im finally talking to a friend that i kind of ghosted again id been having broken sober by oceans divide stuck in my head when i wake up its all falling over youre broken and sober youre bleeding the worst of the past through your eyes and that was still in my head today but the song that i woke up to this morning was breathe by lo spirit i wanna feel like i can breathe breathe breathe breathe when the weight of the world is crashing down on me and its just its just nice to see the progress already happening i think my favorite thing about today is that someone told me they can see the light in my eyes i had thought it to myself only an hour prior to them saying that and it makes me happy someone noticed and said something god winks i guess oh also my roses are growing leaves again they almost died while i was in the psych ward and ive been having a hard time taking care of them but recently im remembering to water them guess were both recovering huh i just cant believe that it feels good to be alive,post-pandemic

do you guys relate when you want to ask something but find even making a post overwhelming the feeling of making sure that its perfect ie your writing conveys your message as best as possible editing and reediting multiple times ending up not asking because of these reasons would it be more convenient to just have a thread for inquiries tips and suggestions especially for specific questions which doesnt need a background context of 200 words imo thisd make the sub more useful for a lot of people here note i just saw that theres a megathread for short posts while i was writing this but i dont think most people would know its there unless they go through the whole wiki if you guys think this is a valid issue can we get the megathread or a new weekly thread pinned for this,post-pandemic
as a very emotional person ive found comfort in food like i just enjoy food completely i dont talk about it often but i think about it constantly what im going to eat later or what im gonna make for dinner or either what kind of new or exotic foods i could try its really comforting to me but idk why i do it i just love food it sucks cause i feel so fat when i think about food then i go on and starve myself while my brain just sits there in limbo idk what to do i lost 30 pounds in the last 2 months cause of this and then when i do get the chance to enjoy food i feel guilty when i get good food in me,post-pandemic

to look at my life from outside everything looks perfect perfect partner supportive family good friends good and stable job but somehow still everything feels overwhelming keeping my partner happy keeping friends and family happy keeping partners family happy keeping boss happy i feel burden of everyones emotion if someone has a slight change in their behaviour towards me i feel overwhelmed by it which makes me constantly worry what might i have done wrong so everything feels difficult as it feels like even small things required huge efforts getting out of bed is difficult difficult tasks paralyze me i constantly worry if people like me or not am i being a good and kind person or not my house is always a mess work feels daunting everything feels too much to handle future also feels difficult finding better job which gives me better salary taking care of parents as they are getting older now growing my family with my partner more responsibilities to come and im not even able to manage current responsibilities i understand people have it worst than me and i should be grateful for what i have but still i cant help but wonder that wont it be easier to just die i have jokingly mentioned this to partner many times and he gets upset about it i feel im just alive for my parents and my partner but i fear i might stop caring about this and end everything for once im tried to living with this mental burden ps i have not yet tried to get officially diagnosed with adhd yet out of the fear that i might not have it but i relate each and every post in this community,post-pandemic
hey everyone im a 38yearold living in europe my journey with adhd began quite early around the age of 34 back then my hyperactivity was off the charts from stuffing muffins in the vcr to exploring the dangers of electrical sockets i kept my parents constantly on edge understandably they were concerned about my safety several psychiatrists and psychologists confirmed my adhd diagnosis however my mom hesitant about traditional medication like ritalin opted for alternative approaches while herbal remedies offered some relief the real turning point came in my early teens while the hyperactivity subsided focus became a significant challenge this wasnt uncommon as many with adhd also grapple with inattentiveness interestingly around this time i was also identified as potentially gifted and highly sensitive known as zbre in french after a year and a half of gestalt therapy im in a great place no medication just selfawareness and a newfound appreciation for the unique strengths adhd brings to my life while some challenges remain im actively harnessing the positive aspects proactivity imagination agility adaptability etc living with adhd is a unique journey filled with both hurdles and incredible potential my story is just one example and i encourage others to share theirs,post-pandemic

im 21 and i just dont know if ill live on this planet any longer i personally dont see myself living up to 25 even though my parents think ill outlive them and live up to old age but in my state i just cant see myself living long i have autism and its one of the worst things ever even though my mom calls it a gift if autism was a gift then why did i have to have someone sit beside me from elementary to high school during all classes to monitor my behavior why didnt i have any friends back in school like i cant think of nothing good in my life im currently an neet ive been one since ive graduated high school even graduating high school wasnt good because i was class of 2020 and covid was terrible that yearno prom or anything for me my life feels empty and dull majority of the time i feel out of place and fake i dont feel like exercising because it does absolutely nothing for me taking walks does nothing for me either i have bad hygiene because i always sweat no matter how much i try to keep myself clean by taking showers and deodorant my phone which really isnt even my phone doesnt have any working phone number i dont have friends irl i never went to college but if i did i wouldve been in my last year at this point i dont have anyone to really talk to my daily routine is waking up listening to music using twitter and watching reaction channels earlier tonight i accidentally hit my laptop against the wall since i have in an apartment and it broke instantly and now i cant use it to watch my favorite reaction channel i just feel like nothing good or interesting really happens to me i havent drawn in years so ive probably lost my touch in art in a while the only thing im really decent at anyways i really dont see the appeal of life tbh im 21 and ive never had a girlfriend either i use twitter a lot but twitter has become one of the worst experiences for me online i remember back when i was 1415 and i used an online app where i could interact with people who were all fans of minecraft but that app became a bad experience for me when two girls talked down on me and told me how worthless my existence was then years later i started using twitter and it wasnt much better i gained friends on that app but tons and mean tons of people just keep bringing me down and calling me weird on there i gained a following but despite having tons of followers on there i never gain any traction on none of my posts and i dont know why whenever i make a vs battle post which is my favorite thing to do i never get any likes or comments despite having 6k followers but i always see people with less followers than me actually get likes and commentsalways 1k likes or more and theyre also usually respected and its not that worse whenever i make a slightly controversial tweet thats the only time i get traction and i always get ridiculed by people in the comments and qrts for me i remember when i complained about me not gaining any likes or attention on any of my posts and one guy was being annoying and stated cant relate i dont need likes i got my friends but meanwhile i dont have any friends when i do try to make friends they just resent me and talk down on me on that app i always get hated on and ive had one guy threaten to beat me up and claim that he doesnt like me even though i wasnt interacting with him me having bad experiences with people irl and online caused me to gain apathetic thoughts and become more aggressive and now whenever i think about someone i dont like i have the worst intrusive thoughts of wanting to physically hurt them and usually i cant get that thought out of my head my parents dont understand me and theyre oblivious when it comes to my perspective on things since theyre not autistic i dont have a car and i dont drive either but now i just feel empty and dull i dont know what i will do tomorrow since my laptop is now broken and theres not much i can do my phone im using a throwaway account for reddit and it wont take long until im suspended because my main account got suspended for a misunderstanding so now i really cant use any kind of social media anymore part of me feels like god himself hates and despises me and the other part of me feels like im just very unlucky and not interesting and the only reason why i was created was to be lumped in with the other uninteresting people in the world i also think about sex a lot and masturbate on a daily basis which has never happened much back when i was in high school but now that im out of high school sex is always on my mind despite me being a 21 year old virgin ive been mad fun of by other people on twitter for being a virgin and i just really hate the way that life is structured i really dont see how i can put up with this for 50 more years or soaverage life span for a man is 71 i believe i dont want to live long anyways because life is not interesting nor fun the phrase life is not meant to be fair really does apply here i also think me being a man is another reason why my life is terrible since men dont care about each other and majority of the time were expected to be hyper masculine strong willed strong physically and never let emotions get the best of you and men are always supposed to protect others and care about others more than themselves specifically women and children theres people even younger than me living better than me having sex being appreciated by others etc theres truly nothing interesting in my life im not here to victimize myself i dont view myself as a victim of anything anyways since theres objectively people out there living worse than me who indeed are victims i just had to vent my thoughts out because i tend to overthink a lot and if i didnt vent i probably wouldve gotten angry and just start hitting myself and banging my head which i havent done in a long time,post-pandemic
feel like a fucking failure i lost my wallet with half my rent money was gonna make a money order for my rent that day after work and other sensitive documents in it and photos of dead loved ones i cant get copies of anywhere else just realized i left my fucking expensive work scrubs at the laundromat and no one has turned anything in so theyre probably gone forgot i had a follow up doctors appointment this fucking week because i for some reason convinced the appointment was in april and didnt think to call for a reminder i have no refills on my meds and follow up appointments fill up fast at my doctors office ive already taken so much time off from work already this month and i dont want to request more on top of telling my boss that i dont have my uniforms so i cant even fucking work it hasnt been this bad in a while adderall didnt fix everything but it was such a big help im so ashamed of myself and so frustrated im a failure i dont know why everything is falling apart,post-pandemic

sober from drugs sugar pornographymasturbation internet anything i have some insight from my own life to share that might help some of you i am a male in my early 20s since i was 15 i was into drugs started off with weed and it evolved from there i suppose i would have been known as a polydrug addict i have had stints with most classes of drugs including marijuana alcohol prescription amphetamines cough syrup opioids as well as some psychedelics the big one for me was marijuana like many of you i realized i had a problem this was about 25 years ago i struggled for some time trying to get sober from drugs i experience depression and anxiety which didnt make things any easier like a lot of people i want to grow i yearn for it as im sure most of you do too when i realized i had a problem with drugs i labelled it as the primary culprit of all my woes and troubles basically if i could just get sober i would magically be a better person thats all that needed to be done well this year i spent more time sober than at any point in my life prior to the age of 15 im guessing ive spent about 3 months maybe more sober this year you wanna know what i found it didnt magically turn me into a better person i was still feeling the same dissatisfaction that drove me to engage in drug use in the first place the only difference is that i was sober i spent two months this past summer sober and i spent most of those two months sitting on my computer wasting time i wasnt magically more productive my life honestly didnt change as much as i thought it would so what ive learned from this is that you cant just get sober and expect everything else to fall into place theres a very good chance youre engaging in even more negative behavior than your primary addiction and that stuff needs sorting out to getting sober is a killer start its a fuckin hard thing to do but for a lot of us you cant just stop there you have to keep going because theres a good chance you have more things to take care of along the way i know everyone is different and this post might not apply to most what ive said might be obvious to a lot of you however i spent a lot of time beating myself up over using drugs while simultaneously ignoring the other parts of my life that needed to be taken care of with that being said my hope is that someone relates to my experience and can get at least a lil something from this post safe journeys everyone and have fun,pre-pandemic

idk if this is the right thing to post i js need this released from my brain and out in the world somewhere i guess im almost 17 and have been doing some hard drugs since 15 but not very often at all until the passed summer also been kinda an alcoholic since then with it getting progressively worse and very bad at some points got into molly binged on it for half the summer also mixing it with booze and acid and weed ofc after a while tho my friends ex who was selling it to us cut us off cuz he didnt want her to do it anymore so fast forward a couple months were stealing dxm everyday raiding grandpas medicine cabinet whenever we can drinking almost daily and doing all of this at school a little molly on rare occasions but nothing like the summer suddenly tho only in december i think i was able to get in contact with another one of that friends exs i originally was gonna buy molly i knew for a long time he had it but when i finally arranged to pick up he was out he said he could sell me meth instead and my stupid dumb idiot brain said yes because i didnt care at that moment i just wanted to get fucked up and i always heard they were like cousin drugs or something well i liked it a lot so i saved money for a week and a half doing yardwork and shit went back and got more before this i never had a steady supply because the guy either died or had a complicated situationship w my friend and cut us off but this guy wasnt dying and he definitely wasnt cutting us off it didnt take me long to start going through it faste and once i was done i didnt want to wait for the cash i started stealing bottles and trading or selling them and selling a little weed too thats not enough anymore though and i want to get high so bad i started selling things like my monitors and old watches and anything worth shit in the house nobody would immediately notice is gone and im starting to realize how fucked this is getting while my classmates are solving math equations at 9am im snorting crytal meth in the bathroom somehow my mom hasnt noticed even though just by looking at me you can tell im on smth i told her i was cleaning up and giving old stuff to friends when she saw my missing stuff she always says shes proud of me because im doing so good and im not drinking as much and i js wanna cry bc im letting her down so much and she doesnt even know i dont want to tell her it would actually break her heart and she has enough stress but im getting worse and idk what to do or who to talk to i want to make her proud but also sometimes i js want to give up and tweak until i drop dead if i did get help is there a way to do it without her knowing too much would rehab really be my best option sorry this is so long and dumb but i have nobody to tell about this and constanly thinking abt it is killing me anyways if u actually read this whole thing thank u sm i hope ur having a good day or night stay strong,post-pandemic

i have been abusing so many things in my life that i cant even keep track my saving grace is the fact that i cant possibly keep all of my addictions at the same time so some have been rotating in and out of my life the ones i liked the least i was able to get over entirely i am not even sure if other people can relate but i get insanely enthusiastic about anything i like which generally means i abuse something until i get so sick of it that i need to abuse something else am i doomed to live in this circle one of the biggest addictions in my life has been alcohol i have been drinking regularly 2x per week at least for 16 years now luckily it doesnt work for me as it used to the negatives outweigh the positives now and i noticed that i am drinking less now i feel ready to have a 3 month break after my next big social event but honestly my mind is already searching for something else to abuse i was able to steer that craving towards sports a few times in my life but i overdid it so much that i got injured a few times already currently recovering from a ligament injury on the other hand i am trying to get into healthy eating but then i can feel my lizard brain just craving unhealthy comfort food the drug i am most terrified of is ketamine i love it so much that i would love to have it every single day i told myself that i will never do it again because i know that i dont even stand a chance to use it in moderation but sometimes i think yo maybe i should just indulge in it once a week if it helps me stay distracted from my other addictions how are yall just balanced human beings that enjoy things in moderation,post-pandemic

cw sexual assaultabuse pedophilia panic attacks i am so happy and just proud of myself in general i was molested and sexually abused as a kid and it left me with a lot of emotional scars i get flashbacks and panic attacks a lot and even in a safe consentual environment if someone touches my genitals i have always either started crying or dissociated ive been on tinder lately and i met this really sweet woman lets call her stephanie and we sent each other memes for a couple days we decided to meet up for coffee and we talked for hours about music spirituality art being gay were both women and we really hit it off we went to the book store and then played video games at target and then we went to a park we kissed at the park and her lipstick got all over my face and we laughed at each other and i felt really comfortable with her we decided to go to her house to watch a movie long story short we cuddled for a bit and then ended up having sex it was really weird actually feeling comfortable enough to express myself like that with someone i didnt even have a glimpse of a flashback this probably sounds super lame but im really really proud of myself i feel like this was a huge step in healing from my trauma and allowing myself to exist beyond what happened to me as a kid i feel like one of the reasons why i felt so comfortable was because we talked a lot about boundaries and stuff beforehand and i mentioned that id been sexually assaulted in the past and that i might need to stop if i start freaking out and she was really understanding and sweet and always really communicative stephanie and i both agreed that we should definitely go on a second date im just really happy and gay and proud of myself and stephanie is really cute that is all,pre-pandemic

i saw another post which was literally the same thing that happened to me but only worse and it was 9 months ago this is a repost because the other got deleted from the social skills sub reddit i have bad social anxiety by the way basically i was at the gym in the middle of the night around 3am as i usually go it is usually the same handful of people i noticed when i go i was working out when this girl that id seen there before asked me to help her with a machine because she couldnt reach the handle i was the closest person too her and no one else was nearby i didnt know how to use the machine so it took me a long time to help her which was very awkward already because i had no idea what i was doing after fiddling with the machine with the very long time i finally got it at the level she wanted afterwards before she got on the machine she started talking about how she couldnt reach the machine and that that she was too short etc and she went on talking about other stuff that i think as well that i cant remember and talked for quite some time all i could say in reply was yeah literally multiple times like maybe 1015 or more i literally contributed nothing to the conversation she eventually said thank you for the help and i said no worries and walked off walking off i felt like i was dying and the worst thing in the world just happened i was completely demoralised and my mood was destroyed afterwards and i dont know how i finished my workout i didnt even want the girl to see me the rest of the time in the gym walking home i felt like i was mourning someone dying before i was leaving i was thinking ill come at a different time for 3 months so she wont remember me then ill come at my normal time and talk to her as if im a new person because shed have forgotten who i am i tried that but it didnt work and i saw her soon after the first time i saw her she looked at me in the mirror as she walked past behind me she avoided walking in front of me later and walked behind the machine i was on even though its a longer distance ive seen her almost every time i work out since then and been going weve been going at the same time for 9 months we havent spoke or made eye contact i can barely look at her and feel extremely uncomfortable when i have to go near her and try to avoid her i didnt notice at the time but she is a 1010 and i would have wanted to get to know her which makes this whole thing worse i know i fucked this up and its done but i cant get over it and its killing me to make things more detailed she seems to have avoided going near me a few times and go around or behind where i am one time she was sat on a machine and i looked at her from the side and she turned her head abruptly either to avoid eye contact or so i dont talk to her she sighed once whilst walking past me too what do i do is this as bad as it seems and if it is how do i get over it,post-pandemic

hello everyone i have a question for the more knowledgeable in this community i have been dealing with great sadness for a large part of my adult life i searched for a psychiatrist back in 2020 for depression and suicidal ideation i was even hospitalized because i was deemed a threat to myself for a while but twice in my life i experienced a great high that lasted for around 6 weeks each time i was diagnosed with schizophrenia in 2022 but i always felt like my mood symptoms werent being treated especially the feelings of sadness and hopelessness these feelings were always chalked up to side effects of schizophrenia but all of january i experienced the high that i mentioned i was incredibly happy and satisfied i was very productive i didnt sleep much but i was very energetic then it suddenly went away and now im left with the sadness and loss of motivation again my doctor believes i had a period of hypomania for the duration of late december and all of january he told me i exhibit signs of bipolar disorder so now i am described as schizophrenic with bipolar symptoms on my card so i wanted to ask what does this actually mean i couldnt find anything about someone having both schizophrenia and bipolar disorder i did however find a lot of articles on schizoaffective disorder i will not diagnose myself and i mostly trust my doctor but i feel like my mood symptoms are only being treated now after about 4 years of being ignored i am happy that were moving in the right direction but like i said i cant find anything on someone being called schizophrenic with bipolar symptoms before i was diagnosed with schizophrenia i was diagnosed with pseudohallucinatory syndrome which i also couldnt find anything about this diagnosis was from a different doctor a very bad one i might add i like my current doctor but sometimes i cant figure out whats going on inside his head so can someone explain the difference between schizophrenia with bipolar symptoms and schizoaffective disorder and is it normal for mood symptoms to be present along with my current diagnosis of schizophrenia,post-pandemic

my experience of sound of sensitivity varies its most worst when im anxious ive heard for some its the sound sensitivity that makes them anxious whats your experience with sound sensitivity for context i went through a phase where listening to tv adverts would be so loud and made me jump out of my skin to the point id fear the next one the basic tone and the louder ones would have the biggest differences also pedestrian lights every time they went off beeping it would send electric bolts through my head and make me feel weak id panic at lights with apprehension those examples have never been consistent is this something else,post-pandemic

hi i am a 54 16 year old and am currently in anorexia recovery having some doubts and some questions that i was hoping someone of any experience could help with 1 should i be tracking calories if so how many i ask this because i am currently counting to make sure i hit my calories per day for at least some weight gain this unfortunately has caused me to be very obsessive and controlling over what i eat and how much i eat yes i am meeting my limits per day but i still feel some sort of restriction with it and in the longrun see it harming me more than benefiting 2 can i still exercise while recovering exercise makes me feel good and more energized and productive throughout my day i only lift weights and its for around 30 min every other day i am not obsessive with it and do not see it in a negative way but i want to ask if i can still recover fully with it it also helps me eat more and feel the need to as i want to become stronger and healthier 3 how do i get my period back i have only had an eating disorder for 6 or so months and i have been in my calorie surplus for around a month and have been gaining weight but no period is there any way to hurry it up 4 is there any apps or suggestions to keep me going and keep me motivated to continue recovery its only been a month but i still have my doubts and weird habits of restricting early and eating all my calories at night this causes me to feel guilty and terrible and i need ways to fix it so it doesnt continue 5 one more problem i have is always leaning toward more healthy options and following food rules i worry that trying to solve this now while gaining weight will force me back in anorexia and i will end up wanting to loose weight again should i focus on food rules after i get to a normal weight or should i try to force myself thank you,post-pandemic
i love when i finally make a friend i can relate too and we talk pretty often it feels nice meeting someone and that feeling of loneliness goes away finally you guys talk everyevery other day and you feel like you finally made a friend no you then notice they stop replying at a normal time and then youre lucky if you get a response ins 24 hours you figure theyre just busy so you let them be but you see them playing everything you used to play together with someone else or without you you dont say anything because you dont want to be clingy and eventually they stop replying completely you message them again and they completely ignore it and youre back to being lonely wondering if youre just boring annoying or both,pre-pandemic

my bf got his phone taken on monday and its been about 6 days of no contact expect for at school but were both very awkward so its difficult to make conversation 1 on 1 infront of others and i just feel very abandoned it feels like he just doesnt love me anymore hes seems fine and unbothered without talking to me for so damn long like he loves the fact we arent talking as much and he doesnt have to give energy on me just because hes grounded im pretty sure his parents let him keep his xbox he plays fortnite a lot and i logged on today and he was active literally at the moment i genuinely felt like i was being ignored and he doesnt care about me but i just logged off before i could feel any worse just seeing him playing with his friends and the thing is that the xbox connects to his computer so he has access to his discord app the first time we dated he cheated on me with two people on his discord and had a massive porn addiction with the amount of porn servers he joined in he has no girls on his discord the last time i checked but what if he is talking to a girl during this time he doesnt have access to his imessages which is what we communicate though im so scared im gonna get cheated on again all the im gonna put a ring on ur finger and were gonna grow old together bullshit he says feels like complete lies i know hes trying to change his ways for me but the amount of self sabotage i do might make him snap one day and cheat on me with a girl thats easier and oh my god the porn i fucking despised his porn addiction it absolutely teared me apart that he was watching porn with the white girls who are so skinny with big tits and ass im a chubby latina barely with tits nothing close to the girls he was watching left me with no appetite for weeks i obviously was done with this shit and told him to fucking stop or i was gonna leave even though i didnt want to and he pinky promised hell stop pinky promises are our thing and we take those very seriously and he knows if one is broken i threaten to harm myself and then give slient treatment and he is genuinely avoiding porn i hope so but since i have no idea what is he is doing right now he could be viewing that shit right now and its killing me that i dont know what hes fucking doing right now we were supposed to hang out this weekend too because he wasnt able to go prom with me last weekend due to being suspended when i was looking forward for it the whole week he understood i was extremely upset and spent money on me on valentines day and gave me lots of affection at school but we didnt spend quality time and im still kinda upset that we havent spent proper time together since the first time we dated just to note its our third time back together and this is the second time were not able to spend time because hes grounded again i just feel so damn abandoned by him can someone give me some advice please i really am trying to be positive but i just ended up rotting in my bed this past week over him,post-pandemic

hey guys had an awful panic attack that sent me to the er back in august and started a whole slew of anxiety related problems and oh boy i dont wish this upon anyone so i have had pretty much every symptom under the sun from anxiety and ssri medication i could barely function work study i couldnt leave the house then the health anxiety started up and i wa sure i was dying all the time pain would be all over the place and move around and change the type of pain all just anxiety life was brutal but since we rarely see posts on this i am doing way better i feel like my normal self and honestly feel like i am a better person i am much more compassionate sympathetic and understanding because of my experiences and for everyone battling anxiety i know it can feel hopeless but you can get better take things one day at a time just try to do 1 thing better everyday,pre-pandemic
i was diagnosed with catatonia my former psychiatrist wanted me to get on lorazepam but i refused because i didnt think my condition was severe enough for the need to get on a controlled substance however i had a severe catatonic episode yesterday it was frightening i hope that i can take lorazepam as needed because i dont want to become addicted to it i cant see my current psychiatrist anytime soon but i need something to treat this condition asap im having mild symptoms right now and im afraid of it getting worse again it feels like someone else is controlling my body movements i get stuck in weird uncomfortable positions stuck in staring at the wall or random objects i cant move im mute and im fully aware of whats happening feels like im caged in my own body when i tried to break myself free yesterday i slammed my hand onto a metal container and it hurt alot it was involuntary it happened so fast i wasnt expecting it it caught me off guard i was wondering since lorazepam is a controlled substance medication will the er prescribe it to me or do i have to go to the psych ward i want to avoid the psych ward because theyll make me stay there for 36 days which is too long for me note i tried gabapentin before but i had a serious side effect from it so next in line is lorazepam edit my symptoms are gone for now i called a local crisis center they informed me that my former psychiatric provider can still prescribe me lorazepam he suggested until i see my new psychiatric provider i just need to call them after the weekend when theyre back in the office,post-pandemic

i have ptsd due to being violently drugged kidnapped and raped in college my boyfriend and i have had lows in our relationship sexually because of this most times i have flashbacks because he does something small that triggers me and idk how to explain it to him so i act like nothings wrong but he knows today before we had sex we talked about it we discussed for 30 minutes everything we wanted to do and i told him everything i could think of that made me uncomfortable and i had the best sex of my life its a small success to some but being able to be intimate with my partner without fear of my ptsd and how it may seem to him is a huge step for me and i am happy to be able to have sex for the first time without any kind of trigger or fear normally i dont tell him during sex if im triggered but he can tell and he stops anyways today we had sex after 3 years of dating that was just us no ptsd just us and i feel like i made so much progress it just feels so good to know my rapist has no control over that part of my life anymore and that my intimacy with my partner sexually can develope more now,pre-pandemic
anxiety is being invited to a party months prior getting up washing 3x dressing going to the shop taking your time to buy the most expensive cake and prosecco going to the venue getting through the first set of doorsthen freaking out and leaving without seeing anyone then calling a friend getting her to stop by yours before she gets there to take your gift and lie for you by saying i had to work night shift im a nurse then spending the evening beating yourself up for missing yet another event ruminating on what theyre doing what theyre talking about and the memories theyre making without you knowing its just a matter of time till everyone finally stops inviting you to things then of course walking home leaves you even more freaked because your ptsd makes you jump at every loud noise out there and its fireworks season anxiety is a thief of experience,pre-pandemic
we all know that the food we eat has a huge impact on the way we feel ive always wanted to be more natural to eat fewer processed foods for my physical health as well as my mental health ive over the last 18 months taken a journey off medication and through a variety of foods to the place where i stand today where am i today i take no medication i have motivation to do the the arduous things in my life i do not wish to do except dealing with my phone bill thank god for direct payments im full of energy that i can always harness ive gone from being an anxious bag of nerves with diagnosed depresion on 30mg of citalopram a day to having a very stable and upbeat mood even when things go wrong i look to the bright side and dont let it beat me who am i a 24 year old male with diagnosed adhd as recently as may i was on 40mg of methylphenidate a day 10mg 4x daily today is 2 months since i took a single pill how does food affect this glad you asked hypothetical adhder consider this food makes you emotional when you havent eaten you get hangry when were really hungry we crave food its all we can think about it distracts us more than anything else many of us are compulsive snackers its pretty clear that there is some relationship between food availability and distraction what have you done about it im about to tell you all the steps in my journey free of charge so that you can understand why some things dont work and why other things do work warning you will not accept my conclusion you will go ahead and try all the steps anyway if youre interested in this method thats fine all i ask is an open mind and that when you commit to each step you fully commit youre only cheating yourself if you dont jump in 100 step 1 processed food is bad for you whether dr barkley says so or otherwise since children those of us in our twenties have been told that eating processed foods is bad for adhd and causes behavioural symptoms whether dr barkley says so or otherwise this diet and advice still holds some traction in several countries i tried eating my usual diet pasta rice potatoes beef chicken some fish bread tomatoes but cutting out ingredients with names i recognised as looking something i found in chemistry class results 1 no changelong story short dr barkley is right i saw absolutely no change worse than that i didnt even see a significant change in my physical health my skin didnt clear up i didnt lose a kg or two from around the middle nothing worst experiment ever step 2 sugar is bad for you keto or paleo or whatever you want to try we are told that eating sugar messes up our brains by causing massive spikes in blood sugar and huge emotional highs followed by enormous depressive lows so i tried eating keto what i was told by the people in my life who tried to sell it to me sugars cause spikes and carbs break down into sugars so avoid eating all carbs and avoid spikes get ripped and stay mentally stable results 2 got fat depressed and literally insane first of all trying to feel full on such energy dense foods as meats and eggs and fish with nolow carbs super hard i smashed through the water all the time trying to fill my stomach still i was overeating and i put on weight 12kg of weight thats 262lbs for you americans what the damn hell secondly depressed i rang samaritans every day for two weeks i was soooo close to ending my life i was working on the final year of a university degree taking huge amounts of meds and still unable to work i was fat my skin got worse my hair started receding not sure why but i think due to the excess hormones in the cheap nasty meat i was eating i developed mouth ulcers and cold sores my skin started peeling off around my nose and eyes my self esteem was not just at rock bottom it was drilling for the centre of the earth i was in a terrible place thirdly literally insane negative emotions flying everywhere you know how when youre hangry you crave sugars or carbs imagine not satisfying that craving for weeks on end people say something and you just fly off the handle youre incredibly touchy about everything especially your appearance and your friends can recognise youre in a hole and so they mention eurgh do not recommend worst experiment ever step 3 and results 3 idgaf feeling like ive tried everything i just ate what i wanted for a while after keto this meant no meat plenty of bread kind of got back to step 1 step 4 cardio everyday ive always been hugely into cardio i really dont enjoy lifting but i love riding my bike seriously riding bikes is cool if you take nothing else from this buyride ayour bike results 4 this is sort of ok lost 8kg of the 12kg i put on in keto skin cleared up a bit started eating just loads and loads of fruit to stay fuelled up during the immensely long bike rides i was going on bananas are fave for this the longer rides i went on the better i felt step 5 vegetarian high carb low fat not sure how many of you know this but one of the most prominent cycling youtubers out there is a guy called durianrider durianrider has diagnosed adhd hes a vegan and his diet has almost zero fat no protein powders and just shit loads of fruit the guy is ripped like noone ive seen before and hes happy everyday but vegan no way man im addicted to cheese and milk and eggs results 5 some self esteem returns adhd is still flying everywhere im not applying to jobs after ive graduated im getting in arguments with my parents but my physical health is never better turns out your body is a herbivorous mainly frugivorous well adapted to eating plenty of plants machine eating carbs gives you fuel all day everyday fruit sugars are nothing like refined sugars the fibre and phytochemicals in fruit prevent it being absorbed quickly it regulates your blood sugar and seeing as your brain runs on blood sugar your brain activity is regulated when you eat fruit hallefuckinglujah im human feeling at last step 6 legendary difficulty vegan ive always been a positive person and i knew exactly how cruel the dairy and eggs industries are they are horrifically cruel when i first found out about it i was shellshocked i didnt move for 5 minutes and i am not a squeamish person i decide to veganism a try fair go i decide to educate myself first and watch this speech by gary yourofsky 1 hr long again for the second time in my life i am rendered literally speechless later in the video i am rendered literally speechless for the third time in my life results 6 motivation selfesteem and a just cause so here i am and ive been vegan for a couple of months i feel great initially i felt more energetic and happier the motivation didnt come immediately however within the first two weeks i had a bit of gas for a few days i was pooping out of control i think this was down to a fundamental change in my gut bacteria as i was no longer consuming any animal products at all there was a significant change once this stopped i was fully adapted to this diet and i felt even better than i did initially and the motivation came as you will see in the above linked video there are serious health benefits to going vegan over going vegetarian the inflammation caused by animal products may exacerbate the symptoms of adhd i dont know i cant find any studies on the subject let alone a conclusive one what i do know is that now i spend my entire day doing things that even 3 months ago were a dream im applying to several jobs a day im exercising because i want to not because i feel like i have to manage myself please note i am not trying to preach my lifestyle to you a large part of being vegan is not wearing wool leather or silks that may be a step too far for you additionally i dont drink alcohol or coffee not because im vegan but because i dont enjoy being intoxicated that may also be a step too far for you personally which is more than fine you do you what i am trying to do is share the positive and negative experiences i have had with my relationship with food and how it has affected my symptoms a plant based diet is inherently healthier if i can get just one of you to seriously try a plant based diet for a month i believe the positive effects will be so great that you will want to stick to it for life and this post will have been worth it i wish you all best of luck,pre-pandemic
ive had anxiety panic disorder and depression since i was 13 i have lost so much trying to simply stay alive and functional most of my regrets are based around the same thing i was too scared to do it its like im constantly mourning the life i could have led if not for this thing thats been a part of me for so long that it sometimes just feels like its actually who i am,post-pandemic
i am happy to share with you today that ive gone from an anxiety disorder age 4 adhd diagn age 6 bipolar diagn age 11 bipolar anxiety diagn age 15 autism after overcoming my anxiety disorder i am starting to think that autism is the human brain evolving to our new digital environment its not a mental disorder as much as it is a mental evolution now is the time to make justice a reality for all children of the world i have a dream where autism is the future of human communication thought process and mental health where mental unhealth stops hiding behind the label of mental illness and claiming the mentally disabled for the bad behavior of nonmentallyill humans that choose not to practice the daily chore of mental health where the mentally ill are no longer fuel in the liftoff of humanity towards a mentally healthy future where instead we can identify the mentally unhealthy practices in humanity that plague the mentally ill and the nonmentallyill alike for the first time in history since the mental asylum mental unhealth epidemic i see a future where humanity can break free of their socially acceptable mental unhealthy ways where we cease trying to be most right and focus instead on being more right by letting go of the fears and selfdoubt fueled by the beliefs of what is wrong where the mentally ill and nonmentallyill can walk together in solidarity past the temptation of mental unhealth towards mental health once again autism is not the enemy autism could very well be the key to understanding how the mentally ill can live in harmony without the nonmentallyill in a way never seen in humanity before if we can set aside our differences and instead seek out how we are similar as humans of the world we very well may see a future where the autisticway can help any human become mentally stronger the same way the teachings of healthy eating and exercise help humans today become physically stronger i have a dream that little children will one day live in a world where they will not be judged by the chemistry of their brain but by the content of their character let freedom ring autismisnottheenemy mostrightisneverrightforever notwrong,pre-pandemic
i have so many questions i want to look up but even basic things lead straight back to veterans it makes me feel ashamed for having my trauma edit i have no issues with veterans and them getting resources to help my uncle works for a va hospital in georgia and there i saw first saw what ptsd was like i thought for a long time only vets got it then years later when i got diagnosed there were no resources for me to understand why it makes my trauma feel less traumatic to see that still today 10 years later only veterans and sometimes rpe survivors have readily available resources,pre-pandemic
this wont resonate with everyone im just posting here whats worked for me also trigger warning if youre not feeling strong dont read 1 disconnect from the diagnosislabel you are not your bpd you are simply a human being thats doing the best you can 2 as much as you disconnect from the label become very familiar with the traits that make up a bpd diagnosis i made a list of the criteria and then i personalized it by writing down examples of how it played out in my own life i kept track over time of how i was doing in each area 3 drugs and alcohol are out they just are we dont have the luxury of indulging in this area if youre serious about transformation be drug and alcohol free edit on reflection this sounds heavyhanded on my part for me even small amounts of drug or alcohol seem to affect me more than many of my friends even weed can make me feel anxious in my real world i havent made this a hardfast rule part of our struggle is to get away from all or nothing thinking what i do know is that i have a tendency to not respond well to any kind of recreational drug or alcohol it can set off a downward spiral ive found that for me my life is much better without it and these days im not trying to escape my reality im very happy with my reality as it is 4 physical exercise becomes the new drug start with walking but commit to doing it everyday the step apps see great to keep track of your steps set a minimum number and commit to reaching it everyday 5 nutrition plays a role sugar in particular ive found being low carb keto specifically has helped tremendously im no longer brain foggy and exhausted all the time 6 relationships ok this is a biggie and the hardest one people are not all good or all bad relationships go through ups and downs stop taking what other people say do or think personally its not about you people have their own shit going on theyre not thinking about you refocus your attention on yourself discover that you have your own back for the first time in your life be there for yourself be your own savior stop the tapes in your head that tell you that you suck that youre too stupid too fat too ugly verbally out loud tell that voice to fuck off dont even attempt to be in a relationship if youre looking for the other person to save you in some way or dont ever make another person responsible for how you feel you are responsible for how you feel people can be assholes but so can you and i none of us a perfect and never will be 7 spirituality reconnect with your spiritual side whatever feels real to you develop a routine of prayer and meditation 8 take care of you make your bed pay your bills make a budget clean your car service your car go to the dentist have a physical exam in short do all the things all adults do to manage their life youre worth it these steps sound simple and most people who struggle with bpd symptoms me included gloss over this stuff taking care of the daily tasks is uber important for us it gives us a sense of structure and security we have to do this for ourselves 9 never take an immediate action on an emotional response youll regret it count to 100 when someone triggers you breathe it out physical exercise helps a lot with this stop the drama everything with love and compassion slow down your emotionality as much as you can remember no one knows whats going on inside your head unless you show it all of us will probably struggle with intense emotions our whole lives but we can manage it not overreacting is a skill we can learn i send all of you love none of us asked for this stuff none of us deserve it but know that you as a human being a worth giving yourself a chance to live your best life i believe in you i was a complete mess a decade ago hard work and time has made a huge difference in my life my life isnt perfect but i now know what its like to be happy i have solid relationships good job and im in the best shape of my life if i can do it trust me when i say anyone can,pre-pandemic

i have spent majority of the past few years in psychiatric hospitals and programs and i just got out of a year long hospital stay in august and i havent been back since this is the longest ive stayed out of the hospital ever all my hospital stays were generally due to various breakups and the feeling of rejection from attachments not to get into it but it does cause major issues with si and sib i havent had too much heavy si in a while ive been externally doing well im getting a lot done but i do still have a fp this person is genuinely the most supportive and healthy for me by far i want to keep them around and not push them away like usual i want to keep this person around theyve had an amazing impact on my treatment i dont want to to take over my life in fact they give me the motivation to improve my attachments just so i can keep them around and go from there i want to improve for them which isnt automatically the healthiest but its a start and i guess has positive intentions im not able to see them right now for complicated reasons or whatever and i have limited calls with them but just for a bit longer so i dont know what theyre doing 247 which is a good thing almost like exposure therapy but occasionally i will hear about another friend a friend theres nothing wrong with that but i immediately want to throw everything away ive been handling my bpd really well compared to a year ago and i dont want to ruin it over jealously of this person literally having friends i would never tell them this because i dont want to scare them like i have with everyone and its a work in progress i want it to get better so bad and this current distance and limited time in my opinion is a good thing because it gives me time to work on my bpd attachments i want this relationship to be as healthy as possible when its easier to see and talk to them but god my brain automatically switches when i hear about a friend and even more if i dont know them or have never heard of them before i try to avoid the whole following their social media and stuff because thats something ive done and it feels like im almost going behind their back and i want to just have a normal relationship but i still catch my self falling down rabbit holes and literally making myself upset i hate how quickly i can feel si coming on over the stupidest things im so aware of what is and isnt okay and it makes me feel guilty for feeling like this and having these thought im not mad at them for having friends i wouldnt get mad at them im mad at myself why the fuck cant i just be a normal person and have normal friendships and relationships i dont automatically think i will jump to suicide or whatever because i do have more skills now and ways to cope but i cant help but ponder thats terrible im so sick of this and i cant lose another person this is getting so old i want to stay motivated to get better and keep going but then so quickly i consider leaving over the stupidest things this is just a rant dont need much i would journal but im not home yet anyways i just feel shitty and thats apart of recovery but i would also like to stay in recovery i will lose so much if i go back to the hospital this is ridiculous,post-pandemic

this is my first time posting on something like this but for some context im 18 afab and recently my favorite person ended things with me for the fifth time we had been talking from october up until a couple days ago he would end things and then start things back up again essentially leading me on and i grew a really bad attachment towards him recently i thought things were getting really serious with us and he knew that i wanted a relationship while he didnt so i asked him about it and he said he didnt love me after giving me so many signs he did and he didnt want a relationship with me yesterday i found out he called me clingy and weirdly obsessed only something merely to use for sex and i feel physically sick to my stomach this absolutely broke me and i dont know how to get over him since he is my favorite person and i dont want to continue an unhealthy cycle of getting over a favorite person by getting a new one if anyone has tips or advice on how to handle this in a healthy way that would be more than appreciated,post-pandemic

this is a reminder that you are not a doctor you are an individual who shares a headspace with an obnoxious and persistent roommate named anxiety you likely have little to no knowledge and training of how the human body and disease processes work your only source of information is google which provides you basic pieces of info but without any context at all to put the medical puzzle together with any accuracy and yet we are prone to listen to the anxiety when it whispers what if you have disease or you should google it and then we attempt to diagnose ourselves i see posts here often that say i have convinced myself that i have disease i have diagnosed myself with disease i am 100 certain that i have disease and to that i say you are not at all qualified to make that determination honestly imagine setting an appointment with a doctor going to your appointment and meeting the person who is supposed to diagnose and treat you imagine that person had never gone to medical school imagine that their only source of information was webmd imagine that they had dozens hundreds thousands of misdiagnoses on their track record and have only been correct once or twice if ever would you take them seriously or value their medical opinion at all next time your livein roommate anxiety decides to diagnose you remember that he is an absolute quack with no training and no credibility stop trusting the opinion of someone who isnt qualified to make a diagnosis,pre-pandemic

i have ptsd from a previous relationship i dont want to go into details but the result is that im unable to do anything sexual without bursting into tears im currently having emdr ive been with my current partner for 2 years for the last 6 months weve not had sex at all my initial response to the trauma was to be hypersexual but gradually this turned into shame and fear i dont know whether this is a normal thing to happen this has made me really confused i use to be so sex positive prior to abuse and now i have so much shame around sex i cant even really think about what happened i dont know if ill ever feel better my attitudes around sex and relationships are changing during the treatment which isnt necessarily a bad thing but will surely impact my relationship for a period i thought i might be totally gay im bi but have typically dated men ive also started having feelings for someone i work with its an obsessive feeling that ive had before and i know its not healthy ive not acted on it at all because i recognise that its stemming from somewhere else i want to spend time with him and talk to him as much as possible hes not expressed romantic interest and neither have i nothing will happen between us but a part of me wants something to but this confuses me too why am i fantasising about him like this i think he values me as a person not as someone to sleep with hes a respectful person that i trust and feel safe with so maybe thats related but i trust my partner too my partner wants to get married and buy a house soon both 25 ive smiled and nodded along but treatment is making me realise that i minimise how i feel and what i want i know im not ready for these things he wants kids i dont know if i do i asked him not to propose last year because theres too much going on hes been very supportive and seems happy to wait the relationship generally is good i love him but i dont know whether we should be together im debating ending things so that i can figure myself out i mostly wanted to get that off my chest but any and all advice appreciated,post-pandemic
but i didnt yay i guess i almost drove off the cliff i was so close to doing it but i sat in my car and i screamed just go home just go home just go home just go home until i made it home and then i sat in my driveway and sobbed when i went inside i broke down in front of my roommates and had a severe panic attack and my roommate just rubbed my back and helped me breath the next day my best friend took me out to eat i told her i almost did it and she said i could tell a few days before that you were off and i didnt say anything im sorry i should have i didnt want you to feel like i was smothering you but it just meant a lot that she noticed and that i could talk to her about it i have a great support system but im just living with this mental illness it hurts my life is so good but im just sick,pre-pandemic

fuck the what i eat in a day recovery videos fuck the railthin vegans who only eat yogurt bowls and oatmeal talking about how theyre a year into recovery and loving it fuck the fear food challenges fuck acting like recovery is all rainbows and sunshine and fuck the idea that getting to a normal weight is all there is to recovery these videos are harmful and damaging no i dont want to see the 4 cherry tomatoes with lettuce that you had for your entire lunch i dont care to watch you makeeat safe food after safe food and call it fucking recovery i dont want to see your fucking before picture that is essentially thinspo so thanks for triggering everyone my recovery was so difficult and it is a conscious state of mind everyday im currently relapsing after months of feeling terrible about the weight i gained in recovery and it feels like trying to find ed recovery content is even more triggering than straight up pro ana stuff people who have been through an ed and are supposedly recovered should fucking know better than to flash pictures of their low weights and document everything theyre eating end of rant please dont hate in the comments this is just my opinion,pre-pandemic

just want to add for people that dont know this yet reference citation from nhs nhs if you are diagnosed with bipolar disorder and the dx is a certainty you absolutely cannot go off of your mood stabilizer lamictal lithium depakote etc because bipolar is a progressive disorder this means each episode will get more and more severe unless treatedboth the mania and the depression and trust me if you mess with or dont take the appropriate meds at a certain point you may very well likely either end up at the hospital at best or die by suicide the black depression and mixed episodes are unbearable and very dangerous to yourself and perhaps others in the case of mania no one wants to hear this i understand but there is insurmountable evidence that bipolar is a genetic based and hereditary disorder it is highly treatable but has no cure i hear so many stories from doctors who are ticked and devastated by patients who get better with lithiummeds but who refuse to keep taking them regularly due to stigma and side effects please please do not under any circumstance shame or encourage ppl to stop their meds unless you are that persons doctor doctors end up with some form of ptsd and burn out from the number of patients who go off their meds and end up dead relapses are also traumatizing in itself and it further complicates things this is why so many people with bipolar have ptsd as well if you find the side effects intolerable please discuss this with a doctor and work out other options im literally not bullshitting this here is a youtube link to a talk by the most respected scholar in the field of mood disorders for more helpful literature google dr kay redfield jamison further note it is also super important to get enough sleep and avoid drugs and alcohol i used to make leeway with this and take my meds and still use recreational drugs thinking it was no big deal but they really mess with your medications another reason is because marijuana and alcohol interrupt your natural sleep cycle in a major way and contributes to further instability research shows lithium is generally the most effective of the stabilizers despite being the oldest and unpopular medication thankfully its cheap as fuck if you would like to know about my personal dealings with the disorder and feelings about medication heres the link to my replycomment to a question asked about why is lithium unpopular umoodistry made a good point about how medication isnt the only route towards healing and that alternative routes are equally valid which should not be shamed i agree with them but want to add that while this is a valid point medication is the fastest and most effective method of treatment for majority of people with bipolar disorder especially in the most severe cases severe episodes will not be helped by alternative therapy although i can see them being useful as adjunct treatment when a person is in a more stabilized state but i am adamant about taking this to a professional first going off medication is very risky without proper handling if you are uninsured and do not qualify for medicaid google for a free medication clinic near you as well as slidingscale clinics also all big hospitals are required by law to take you into their er regardless of your ability to pay and insurance status,pre-pandemic

the test is unfounded bullshit but still the description for intp is an introverted person with well thought out ideas but a lack of purpose to execute them they often get lost in their own thoughts and have trouble communicating ideas they think of all possibilities when coming up with a solution and often start talking before theyve got there i genuinely think that what this is describing is someone with adhd intp personalities are supposed to take up 4 of the population this could easily fall into the band of people with adhd let me know if im an idiot reasons,pre-pandemic
hi for a little background context i am an 18 year old girl who is newly diagnosed with bpd but i had been aware that i most likely had this disorder before i was diagnosed and my psychiatrist had hinted at it as well i am also studying abroad for a semester in a foreign country and i do not really know anyone here i have been in an on and off relationship for about a year now with my boyfriend 19 from the moment we met each other we were inseparable and i feel like that made me so much more clingy and dependent on him than i have been in previous relationships when we are apart it feels like i am dying and i cannot focus on anything or be productive in any way i feel so sad and neglected when he goes to hang out with friends and family and i know that is not right of me he is currently going on vacation for a week and i am losing my mind we are currently long distance since i am abroad but we call and text for hours everyday my whole entire life revolves around him and i do not know how to cope with him leaving i have isolated myself from almost all my friends and completely ruined my sleep i stay up all night and sleep during the day because we currently have an 8hr time difference it is also hard for me to just make new friends since i am extremely shy and have pretty bad social anxiety my midterms are coming up at the end of the month and i just want to be able to study and do well but i cannot because i am just constantly feeling awful since i am away from my boyfriend i dont know how i am going to cope with him leaving and i am scared to be left to my own devices i cannot keep living like this i love him so much with all my heart but i also feel so sad and alone and i know it unhealthy to be this reliant on someone please i need advice what do you do when you are separated from your fp and how to you continue to function when it feels like a part of you is missing i would love some tips on what you guys do to keep yourself distracted and happy ps sorry if this is confusing or badly worded i am frantically typing this as he is boarding the plane,post-pandemic

hey reddit community ive been diagnosed with adhd and lately ive been pondering something thats been on my mind for a while i firmly believe that adhd exists on a spectrum with varying degrees of impact on individuals lives for me its been okay for most of my life im able to get by but school has gotten really intense and it required me to have my life a little more together so i made the decision to start medication specifically adderall its been extremely helpful and im glad i started it however im curious about the longterm effects and what happens when one decides to stop taking medication after a certain period would i revert back to my baseline levels of focus or would it potentially be worse maybe even better compared to baseline i understand that experiences can vary greatly from person to person but im hoping to gather some insights and anecdotes from those who have been in similar situations or have knowledge about the topic any personal experiences advice or scientific insights would be greatly appreciated thank you all in advance for your contributions,post-pandemic

i want to get clean so badly i hate the constant cycle of being clean for a month or 2 and then going on a bender for 2 months then having to apologize to my family for being so mentally absent and all the pain ive caused while using always promising it wont happen again ive struggled with social anxiety for over 10 years when i discovered xanax i immediately fell in love with how it made me feel before i started abusing it i would think to myself like wow this is how it feels to not have anxiety it made me less scared of being out and feeling that spotlight effect and more socialless awkward it felt like it turned me into this version of myself ive always wanted to be but i have an addictive personality and eventually couldnt control my usage ive been to rehab twice but it was forced by family and a therapist so i didnt put in the actual work after too many blackouts and waking up in hospital beds because of family concern i got clean right when covid hit i work from home and am mainly alone all day so i get bored which is now the main reason i always relapse it feels like a hobby almost and honestly its just fun for me being sober is boring i cant take it in moderation i cant control myself no matter how many times i buy again and tell myself that this time will be different i have no self control i drain my bank account buying drugs when im using i just wanna go out and have a good time im always on the go making plans it makes me more confident to go on dating apps and meet people and just go out in general but i dont realize until after i stop that i wasnt being this cool version of myself that i thought i was i slur my words i say dumb shit and make so many typos while texting im reckless i go through my drugs so fast because of false sobriety more is never enough and the worst of it all is when i look back and can only remember fragments of the things i said and did when im on a bender my whole family knows it hurts them so much for them to see me that way when i stop using usually because i dont have enough money to buy stuff i snap back to reality and feel so ashamed and embarrassed of my actions after the initial regret and apologizing to everyone it doesnt take long for me to get so mind numbingly bored again and tell myself that itll be different this time i dont wanna be an addict anymore but that feeling of confidence i get on benzos has such a hold on me especially as i struggle badly with anxiety that feeling of actually having plans and going out and not just sitting at home is so tempting im fucking lazy and dont wanna do anything when im sober but this last bender i crashed my car and that was kind of a wake up call that im not invincible and can actually cause real damage i have an intake appointment next week for an outpatient rehab program im going but im just scared and tired of the grip this drug has on my life thats all thank you for reading,post-pandemic

i just realized this today and i hate it when i feel threatened or triggered i turn into a little kid people sure think its cute especially men who put me in situations where i feel unsafe they dont know that my giggling and little girl voice is a direct trauma response im not flirting the way i dont resist them i freeze and leave my body when they touch me they think its hot even if they did know that theyre triggering my ptsd im not sure if they would even care just as long as they can get what they want from me just a vent i guess im in therapy and its helping having a bad day emotionally today though lots of flashbacks,pre-pandemic
i saw a post on one of the advice subs idr which one basically this guy was having sex with his girlfriend and she asked him if he wanted to watch her have sex with his friends my brain went hey that sounds familiar give me a second while i dig into that then i suddenly remembered my extremely abusive hypersexual ex i think it was the same week maybe even the same session its all a blur where he took the condom off and proceeded to fuck me despite me screaming no and pushing on him and crying before all that he had asked me something about him watching me have sex with guy friends he brought up a specific friend daniel i told him i was uncomfortable with it and i didnt want to do it or think about it later he proceeded to describe it in detail while we were having sex once just thrusting that image of my platonic friend fucking me while he watched i wasnt able to look daniel in the eyes for weeks i got paranoid of every moment around him eventually we got back to normal were not even that close anymore but i hate what my ex did to me and that friendship you know i saw on social media that that ex had wrecked his car i saw the pictures before i read the text and i found myself disappointed when they said he had walked away without a scratch fuck him fucking die for all the shit you did to me for the bruises and the pain and the coercion again and again for the gaslighting and the suicide threats and the rape for taking pictures of me without my consent for fucking existing,pre-pandemic
i only found out about my health anxiety in my 20s but i remember displaying signs as young as 78 years old i remember having an urge to check if my heart was still beating i would physically put my hand to my chest and check my heart was still pumping and it would give me a sense of relief i couldnt enjoy myself for checking this it then progressed onto having anxiety attacks about death dying and the meaning of life i would literally be going around my normal day then have a huge anxiety attack when i got older i moved on to poking and proddinf parts of my body to check for lumps or abnormalities i would literally bruise myself because i was prodding so hard i would find a bone or a bobbly but in my body and convince myself it was a tumour and i was going to die then when i was about 1213 the first computer came into my house and i would use it to doomscroll medical websites and convince myself that my headache was a result of a brain tumour or some other severe disease i then began making countless doctors appointments about small minor things that i thought were life threatening it wasnt untill i was in my twenties that i properly discovered what all this was caused by i spoke to my doctor about it and realised that my health anxiety was probably triggered by my mother having a brain tumour and seeing her in hospital when o was only 2 i am now on anxiety medication and i am doing really well i still have the odd urge to google symptoms or get triggered by people talking about illnesses but i have learned to manage it a lot better,post-pandemic

look i got all this and i see some people who have just got add or adhd complaining about not being able to do collage high school because of various reasons i understand that i was bullied chronically when i was younger too i am now 2425 years of age now when i was 14 i wanted to kill myself i had the stereotypical drunk abusive step dadcan imagine the things he would do at school i couldnt play football because of my dyspraxia so i wasnt cool due to this i was bullied by the popular athletic kids whilst also being shunned by the ones who shared my interests in areas such as anime and games so i was alone at home and at school so what did i do i studied studied again till i understood the continued to study i didnt have a lot at home but i had my books yes no where was safe but it wasnt nearly as bad as id like to remember one thing ive realised from talking to many people with adhd which also includes myself we like to dramatise everything be our relationships our friendships or even traits but getting side tracked i kept my head down realising that if life is a game then knowledge is your exp more you know more you can do fast foreword 4 years start sixth formcollage jockey kids get bad grades and cant continue so i get a clean slate due to all new faces learn how to talk to people properly become popular i guess every talks and knows who i am which is good i even get in a few relationships which lead to intimacy i take up the biggest course i can find triple award engineering triple award 3d design a level maths with further and a level physics my work ethic doesnt change i managed to get d in my btecs and bs in my a levels ive carved out a very small friend group now to this day we still all talk and play games i gained valuable experience with relationships and know i wont be a wet fish when it comes to dating now so whats next a job or university i still lived at home during this point and my step dad hadnt changed i would often stay till closing times to avoid him and study then go to a friends because of this i had signed onto university an electronic engineering beng program i beat all the requirements by a lot so i didnt worry i did get a phone call from them though because of my grades i had been switched to an integrated masters giving me charter ship if i finish the course and work for a year so i do it i struggle i struggle hard with it what i failed to mention is that since about the 14 year old mark i stopped taking tablets i wanted to do this in my control not the tablets but i realised at this point that the tablets arent a hindrance they are there to help me concentrate i pass my integrated masters with a 1st my placement year offer to take me on full time work there for two years take savings and invest market shares stocks turn profit snowballs till i have 30000 take the money and create a start up now owner of my own electronic company with financial backing i wanted to create this post to show people that your disability as people call them arent some sort of affliction which needs to be medicated its a part of you it is you use it as a drive yes sometimes we have to work harder half an hour homework could take me an excess of 2 hours but eventually it took me 10 minutes i live in a studio flat with my wife overlooking most of the city every time i look over im reminded of the crap ive had to go through to get here damn i earned it though adhd isnt a curse its just a debuff which means we have to try twice as hard i hope this helped someone and either if you want to be a chef or artist you may have to try harder but when you get to everyone elses level youll outshine them because of your creativity have a lovely day everyone and keep your chins up youre all awesome,pre-pandemic
ever since ive had my first psychosis more than a month ago and been put on medication quetiapine aka seroquel i havent been the same studying seems impossible i am easily distracted and cannot retain new information easily my memory is failing me continuously and even as i am writing this i fail to find the correct words language used to come so easily to me ive been quick to learn and a bright student all my life but now i feel like what ive been working for getting a bachelors degree is slipping through my fingers my brain just doesnt work like it used to and it is frustrating beyond belief my psychiatrist has already agreed to get me on lithium instead of quetiapine to see if the brain fog was caused by the medication but a part of me is afraid scared that psychosis did not only hurt me as it was happening but wrecked something in my brain beyond repair that this disorder will keep chipping away at me episode after episode until i am left with vague memories of the bright individual i used to be and that loved ones can only observe as i slip into this new persona they hardly recognise usually i try to end every post on a positive note so youre not left with the bitter taste of hopelessness so i guess ill say human brains are incredibly adaptive maybe i can learn to learn again maybe this is a lesson in itself maybe i was never meant to be an academic and this will push me onto another path that will bring more happiness in my future,pre-pandemic

so basically my general anxiety has me worried about driving in general i dont trust my own judgment or other peoples judgment when it comes to operating a large machine but whats odd is that my social anxiety has deterred me from getting my license as well just the idea of getting in a car with a stranger to take the driving test terrifies me i know some people say that sometimes their testing person doesnt even talk to them during the test but just the fact that i have to sit in a car with this person watching my every move is enough to make me feel extremely uncomfortable and on top of that i dont really get to practice because then that means someone has to be with me to teach me my parents have assisted me and taught me some things but even just getting in the car with themmy own parentsis nervewracking because i dont take criticism well even if its just them telling me something helpful or correcting a minor mistake they know i feel uncomfortable with them too and theyve offered to help me sign up for drivers lessons but then that means i would have to get in the car with a stranger im in my mid 20s and its really put a damper on my ability to try to make friends as well because i hate being the person that has to rely on others to drive me if i go out to do things with others its all just exhausting on different levels i mostly wanted to vent but i am open to suggestions as well thanks for listening,post-pandemic
as valentines just passed i just need to get this off my chest when valentines came i gathered up the courage to ask a girl out we were friends for almost 2 years now and honestly i thought she liked me back i really did but anyways i asked her out by giving her flowers and she was thankful for it and accepted it anyways i planned a whole date with her after valentines hell she agreed when that day came she approached me and told me she wasnt into guys like wtf she shouldve told me when i tried to give her flowers it broke my heart as it was my first time actually asking someone out and she didnt tell anyone at all that she was gay my mind sort of froze for a few seconds but i pushed through and said oh and she then asked me if we could still be friends i said yea and i accept you for who you are and that we were still totally fine i tried to play it off acted like it didnt affect me that i was fine but it affected me do greatly seriously she couldve told me after i handed her flowers that situation still keeps popping up on my head and probably will for along time i loved her i really did honestly i think i shouldve not told her i liked her i think i just lost one of the few people that somewhat cared for me i just feel so dumb rn,post-pandemic

hello everyone i am a 29f take guanfacine and venlafaxine and currently doing a residency it ends in june so i am not that far away from the end but based on my recent performance review this past friday i am in hot water and i hate myself i know im smart under all the layers of shit but i have been struggling to cope with this disease my working memory is shit i take ages to do my work and since i started this residency nobody seems to understand a word i say as i have trouble articulating my thoughts on the spot i was excited to do and learn all these new things and now i just feel like i look like the village idiot who cries at work i really thought i was going to cope better but im in an emotional rut my self confidence and self esteem are at a new low i feel like i got older and got an education and i look good on paper but i still did not learn how to live and deal with being this way im too inexperienced im too emotionally immature im fucking up every which way i turn is there anyone that went through a similar thing and can you please share what you did other than therapy please i dont have the time money or mental energy,post-pandemic
so ive just had a panick attack about the possibility of catching nfowleri which i assume you all know well about for the past day because i swam in a pool that i wasnt absolutely 100 certain it was perfectly chlorinated and of coursethe fact that it is very rare didnt help easy my anxiety much at all so i tried doing the math for myselffull of worst cases approximately 90 million americans the country with the most of these cases go swimming in either freshwater bodies or the ocean so lets cut that into a quarter just to be sure because nfowleri cant be found in sea water and mostly not in moving water but that is regarding the whole usa and nfowleri is mostly found in more southern states especially texas california and florida which makenup about 27 percent of usa population but againjust to be sure we will cut it down to 20lowering this number will make the percentage of likelihood go up because we are more strict about who is actually at risk n fowleri usually only has 3 cases per year but some can go unreporteddue to the rarity and similarity of symptoms to bacterial meningitis so again lets be careful according to a source it could be up to 16 a year lets also assume that only 10of those could have put their head under water and may have got it in their nose that puts as at tldr 91000000 020 025 4550000 91m is people who swim 02 for southern states 025 for freshwater lakes 4500000 01 450000 01 for people who dove their heads under the water and could have gotten water up their nose and now 16450000 that puts as at 00000356 which is about 00036 and thats assuming the absolutely worst cases and now even further let us assume another worst case that you are extremely unlucky so lets multiply that by 100 that is still 036 out of 100 how likely do you think that is and that would be assuming you actually swam in a very dirty lake which i think all of us didnt and of course sources the amount of people who swim cases of nfowleri by state here is more on the actual cases of nfowleri a year which is estimated to be about 16 another interesting statistic is this which says about 1 in 10 pools is improperly chlorinated and at first i know this may be anxiety inducing but despite that most cases of nfowleri come from freshwater lakes imporperly chlorinated is better than not chlorinated at all remember that i have just spend a day having a panick attack about this and when i look at this data and the fact that i dont even live in the usa but greece where there werent any reported case as far as i found i feel like an idiot but the fear is still so real,post-pandemic
hey everyone i hope youre doing well i wanted to post and see if others have similar experiences to me so im a guy and not really a people person i havent naturally connected with a social group and dont really have a lot of people around me i have few very close friends and a partner but when it comes to people in my work or living area i seem to be slacking my question is where do i find the quiet people and fellow introverts im definitely not a full introvert because i like social interaction with friends but im very observant and people i know always have plans and consistently have people around them for various reasons i seem to spend a lot of my time alone even if i dont want to it seems much harder for me to build this kind of network i live in a busy city away from my close friends and havent really found social groups i dont think the kind of people i would naturally connect with even socialise much and i dont think theyre accessible for interaction eg other introverts quiet and shy people etc is anyone else similar,post-pandemic
i spent so many years grinding to get into a very prestigious college graduate and land what millions call their dream job well i just lost that job just a few months in and ive been struggling for months already with not liking the city in living in feeling ostracized by people who i thought were my friends and now my girlfriend is being more absent than she already was i also just got a 500 red light ticket last night and in my moments of grievance she was not there for me not even to pick up the phone all i had in my life out here was that job and my girlfriend and both of them are basically gone i want to go home hell i need to go home but i cant help but think whats the point i moved out here and thought wow this place sucks and i hate being a lonely adult but ill keep pushing then i pushed and i realized my girlfriend was gonna keep being the halfass middle school maturity level girlfriend she always was then i pushed more and lost my job then i pushed more and got a 500 ticket whats next my next guess is she breaks up with me because i expect things from her who wants to place bets,post-pandemic

i have aphantasia so i dont see pictures in my head so technically i dont get flashbacks but i sort of do memories and pictures without images get stuck in my head i feel like my ptsd isnt valid some times because i dont get flashbacks in the normal sense i guess its the months of suppressing what i was feeling but i am still coming to terms with the fact that what happened to me was bad and was bad enough can anyone else relate,post-pandemic

im 15 and i think i have social anxiety and even suspect developing schizophrenia because i come from a line of mentally ill people and i wouldnt be shocked if i inherited it because every day i feel like im being watched and listened in on by people even objects such as stuffed animals toys posters photos basically anything with eyes and i also feel like i cant think my own thoughts without feeling like someone is listening in on them like i could be thinking the most stupid thing and i feel like someone is judging me or hearing my thoughts i dont know what to do because its a really invasive feeling and its making me go crazy because its been happening to me for a while now id say since i was 11 any tips on what i could do to fix it,post-pandemic
although she did a lot of things wrong mostly relating to her own self deprecation and her own bdd that helped in my development of body issues my mom also did a lot of things right idk why im posting this i guess just to demonstrate some of the things that make me still love her despite her shortcomings in honor of valentines maybe id love to hear what your parentsguardian growing up did right and wrong as well 1 never made rules around food you want to have a piece of pie or a brownie sundae for dinner or breakfast yeah maybe not every single day but go for it 2 along the same lines never set times for when certain foods were appropriate you wanna snack on a candy cane in summer at 12 am midnight wonderful a popsicle in the freezing dead of winter whatever makes you happy 3 never made comments about her childrens bodies my other family members will say shit behind other family members backs like soandso has gotten pretty thick lately etc my mom has been such an amazing role model to not do this not that i ever would also because i was the one who suddenly gained a fuck ton of weight in like two years 4 always said that its better to be happy in life than to worry about your body the whole id rather be fat and happy idea maybe a bit unhealthy especially when the bdd pendulum would swing back the other way to yoyo dieting and nothing tastes as good as skinny feels but they were good moments to me 5 never made comments about when my clothing sizes were going up the opposite cannot be said for now when my sizes are going down but i look back with nothing but love for the way she treated me when i was having weight gain from my medications and when i was severely depressed from this 6 never put an emphasis on numbers clothes sizes weight etc honestly my father has been exponentially more critical of peoples weights on the scale when i told him what my hw was he said wow ive never even weighed that much in general i think she did a great job of helping me create a positive relationship with food growing up the place where she fell short so to speak was how to love your body no matter the shape or size just through listening to her disparage her self image it actually impacted me a lot when i got fat lol as i get closer to being thirty years old ive begun reflecting more and more on ifwhen i have kids hopefully after recovering what things i can do to ensure my tendency toward disordered food behavior doesnt bleed into their lives or impact their sense of worth i think it is helpful for me to look at things that didnt go right for my upbringing but also to look at the stuff that did,post-pandemic

im embarrassed even writing this im 26f and have been drinking moderately since the age of 21 didnt drink at all as a teenager and while i did have the occasional blackout it wasnt anything that the people around me found to be problematic per se i live an otherwise healthy lifestyle with a vegetarian diet doing yoga and pilates a few times a week and i walk and bike everywhere as opposed to driving about a month ago my dad passed away we all saw it coming because he was an alcoholic who sat on the couch all day and ate nothing but fast food however it was shocking how fast it happened because he simply had a heart attack while he was driving and was pronounced dead at the scene in under an hour i was always the type of person to have a glass of wine after a hard day at work and have a stiff drink if it was an especially terrible day upon finding out about my dads passing i called out of work and did a shot of whiskey at 9am when i went to my moms house i didnt eat or drink anything all day and i just sat in the corner of her living room in an almost catatonic state from how shocked i was my mom began to lecture me about how it was his poor lifestyle choices that killed him and begged me not to drink like he did later that night i waited until she went to bed to sneak shots from the liquor cabinet i gave myself a pass because i was going through something terrible therefore i saw it as an excuse to drink a bit more than i normally do as the weeks went by i dont think i went a single day without drinking at first it was just having two glasses of wine with dinner instead of one and then it quickly turned into having a beer with my lunch then putting cognac in my morning coffee and then going to the bar at night and downing beer and shot combos after already having been drinking all day i didnt want to admit that i have a problem this entire time but i woke up with an ungodly hangover this morning and started having really bad anxiety i immediately went for the hair of the dog and then went straight to work i spent the whole day unable to focus and thinking that im going to die on my lunch break i downed a beet cleanse juice in hopes of getting everything out of my system and bought a package of kava thinking this needs to end now however i dont trust myself and feel like getting sober is going to be impossible im extremely anxious right now and i cant tell if its alcohol withdrawal or just general anxiety i dont even know where to start tbh i wont have insurance for a few more weeks so i cant jump into treatmenttherapy just yet but i want to work on cutting down my drinking for now where do i even start,post-pandemic
last week i have been having new symptoms again all day and of course this time i think they are real problems and that its serious heart pounding strong discomfort on left chest and sternum etc etc i sleep well but once i wake up they hit me like a gun shot it gets better and worse during the day i keep thinking its anxiety and try not to overthink but its impossible funny thing is that i had moments where i got distracted by something and my mind drove away from my body and magic all the symptoms completely disappeared for example yesterday christmas dinner i was getting the heart pounding and and chest pain but when it came the moment to open the presents without even knowing my mind drove away and everything was gone really really gone of course that once i realised what happened and that everything was gone my mind came back to my mind and everything hit me again fucking human mind,pre-pandemic

i was wondering for those of us who struggle with social anxiety whats your feeling about embracing our reflective natureintrospective side as an asset in building our confidence in social settings i think because of our tendency to overthink things this is an understatement our way of connecting with others is really unique and strategic you could say we tend to listen more than we actually talk and i think because people see confidence as synonymous with extroversion being more talkative and outgoing something is just wrong dont you think i mean as a communication student right this is one of the things i am currently pursuing despite knowing my weakness ive learned that effective communication happens when we listen more sounds familiar to me i listen all the time even very conscious of my thoughts and actions my thought right now is if we are that kind of listeners if we just learn to embrace rather than seeing that reflective nature as something we need to overcome once we are able to do that wont we be the best communicators out there i really think people like us are the best at forming deep true relationships and pursuing our passions you could say we are the untrained an unpolished communicators what do you think,post-pandemic

a stigma that ive noticed in the mental health community so many people are happy to talk about it and embrace your differences but oh no dont have a panic attack in front of them dont seek reassurance from todays anxious thoughts and jitters this is something that needs changing it is more than ok for someone with diabetes to be comforted even when their their blood sugar gets too low and it affects their work even if the circumstances of the blip in their health was due to poor diet or a rough week i had a coworker that had this happen at work but when i struggled with low mood i was told we all have days like that dont let customers see you unhappy or uncomfortable this is an issue with how subjective everyday anxiety and a chronic mental health issue is if someone does not understand the effort it takes to behave normally they will default to judging you based on how they deal with it of course its not all bad im lucky to have family and a handful of friends that have seen me go though treatments and recovery so know the full spectrum of my issues and do not judge or baby me i felt like sharing this little rant to hear your thoughts on if youve been accepted or told to hide symptoms from the public to spare their discomfort like your doing it on purpose,pre-pandemic

throwaway account here prefacing this by saying im high right now because im in a lot of emotional pain and im trying to smoke it away so im sorry if i make mistakes or dont really make sense i 24m wbpd started a fwb relationship with a girl 24 wbpd in january 2022 at the time we both told ourselves that we werent interested in finding any other sexual partners and that one would let the other know if anyone got a new sexual partner unprotected sex both our tests for stds were negative and she was on birth control one time during this period she tells me she loves me and i tell her i love her too which i felt i did i had developed an emotional connection with her fast forward to august 2022 when she told me she cant do this anymore and that she cant reciprocate our love and that she would like to have a relationship but not with me especially since i still have problems with bpd it hurt me so much but i had to respect her decision december 2022 while texting she tells me that shes about to get married to someone she met in september and that really hurt me so i deleted our chat telegram june 2023 i get a text from her telling me that she dreamt about me and decided to check up on me she then proceeded to tell me how her life has been during the past 6 months she had gotten married had left the country with her husband to another country her husband got a job offer over there but their marriage had turned sour after 5 months and she didnt think she had feelings for him anymore to the point where she didnt want to have sex with him anymore she told me that she would soon return and get a divorce and that she would love to hang out like we used to smoke weed watch stuff and become fwbs again she returned with her husband in august 2023 got divorced but maintained in contact with her exhusband since she didnt want to lose him as a friend after the divorce we started being fwbs again since she didnt want to get into another relationship she has been living with her grandma since because she doesnt have a job that pays enough for her to get her own place im in a university dormitory and guests arent allowed to stay the night because of that we dont see each other that much in fact between september 2023 and 31 december 2023 we met 4 times 2 times for the night to chill and have sex 1 time after her therapy session to talk and 2 times for about 15 minutes each because i sent her money to buy weed for me we rent a room to chill and i have no problem paying for it november 2023 i started noticing that she was texting me less and reply after 12 days i was kinda hurt but didnt want to say anything because were not in a relationship were just fwbs didnt want to put pressure on her then one time she texted me about her visit to her exhusbands place this was one of those times when i was still waiting for a text back and i got jealous that i wasnt getting that kind of attention so i told her i wasnt happy about the way she wasnt texting me as frequently as before she apologised and said shed fix it january 2023 her bpd symptoms got bad so even though i wanted to have more sex and at least see her more or have online conversations with her more i didnt tell her because i didnt want to put pressure on her i just assumed she couldnt text me or see me because of her symptoms weve seen each other only once this year after new years we didnt celebrate new years together because she was celebrating with her exhusband and one of their mutual friends yesterday she texted me that she thinks i should get my semen tested since she recently got vaginal candidiasis and her exhusband got his semen tested and fungi was found in it i was surprised that she mentioned her exhusband since i thought they were just normal friends apparently in the last 4 months she and her exhusband had gotten closer had talked about their marriage and they had once again developed feelings of care and affection towards each other but decided that theyre not going to be in a relationship again because it didnt work out but decided theyd have sex and they had had sex on multiple occasions and she didnt tell me any of this until his semen analysis wasnt right i was so hurt by the betrayal of my trust and by the fact that she was spending time with her exhusband but not with me i felt like a stupid clown because i was always fantasizing about her and thinking about her and really wanted to spend time with her i thought she was going through a lot so i shouldve disturb her and then it fucking turned out that she was spending time with her exhusband but not me she said she wanted to tell me about it but she didnt think it was necessary because she knows hes clean and he uses protection with other people plus she hasnt had a normal opportunity to tell me she genuinely apologised for this today we talked about this issue again i told her i felt it wasnt fair and that i feel like i deserve to have more time with her she says she already has a best friend and that her fwb cant become her best friend because itll complicate shit which i totally understand i wasnt trying to be her best friend and hes there for her and that she has been through a lot with her exhusband and that hes really there for her and can help her in the way she needs and that shes sorry im not one of the two people who are closest to her i feel like a fool i always share stuff in my life with her and she doesnt do that with me because im not part of this exclusive club of people who deserve to be close to her i feel like just a sextoy to her i care about her and i understand that it might be hard for her to see me or text me constantly but i feel its unfair that she spends more time with her exhusband im not fucking asking to be her best friend or be the closest person but i feel like i deserve more than this this conversation happened like 3 hours ago and now im high because i dont know how else to deal with these negative emotions ive just started thinking that i always get hurt because i fucking care about people too much and give my all to people who arent worthy of it thats the main problem i guess i care

i have been using dopaquel since my diagnosis last year i love it it has changed my life for the better unfortunately its caused me to gain weight and have difficulty losing weight i tried a very strict diet for a while doing 75 hard but it only maintained my weight i didnt lose anything so i gave up at day 45 ive booked an appointment to discuss this because i cant do this anymore my tipping point was realising i was developing new stretch marks i am really scared though i let it go on this way thinking i could find a way to lose weight thinking that its too shallow a reason to take the risk of being stuck with meds that make me feel worse in other ways has anyone experienced this any advice or success stories would be appreciated i have bipolar 2,post-pandemic

be careful i know its hard to be lonely like real hard but recently i over committed into a friendship and ended up backfiring big time especially with online you gotta be careful cos you dont know the real them edit wow i fully didnt expect this kind of response to have 250 up votes at the time of writing this is crazy so thank you this person made me feel like i was absolutely crazy and in some ways i felt it caused me to spiral into such a low place last night but obviously these people just dont care in the same way we do yes we have our struggles with over attaching and need to try control it best we can but also just like all humans our basic instincts is to love someone be it through a friendship or relationship that fulfils this within us also i personally believe social media can and often does make us feel even more lonely therefore this is likely to be my last post for a while and just try to reset myself whilst working on a better me for 2020 and beyond one day the right person will guide us out of this lonely feeling and will understand our needs in order to make us a better person however until then please never forget that only you can make you truly happy and that just because these people cant appreciate our kindness it doesnt make you any less of a person best of luck everyone thank you very much for the support today certainly makes me feel less alone xd if anyone wants to contact me then feel free to on discord my username is lfc4329836 take care,pre-pandemic

ive been using this sub now for quite some time and honestly stopped being so active because i noticed this the more i used this sub to ask for advice about certain symptoms and behaviours it only got downvotes and negative replies and now i realise that people dont want to talk about the negative symptoms of bpd even other people with bpd this really grates on me and while i love this sub for support from others in the same boat i cant stand the fact that this should be our safe space and we still get shit for posting the things we wouldnt want to post to twitter or facebook x200b when people come here with a story about something negative they did or said they are looking for advice to change that behaviour to become a better person and fight that part of themselves no one comes here to glorify abusive behaviour so why are we all so against reading it and helping each other out the more we talk down on people who openly admit theyve done something wrong the more we add to our own stigma the more other people will begin to believe that we are all inherently toxic people and less people will be willing to reach out and ask for help x200b i feel like this sub needs a kick into gear surrounding this topic even if a seperate flair was created so anybody who doesnt needwant to see those posts ie partnersfamily members of those with bpd doesnt have to see them but anybody willing to read and understand and offer support and advice is welcome to in a safe and nonjudgemental space after all isnt that one of the major points of dbt no judgement remember that while reading these posts weve all made mistakes and done things we regret x200b please remember not everyone can affordhas access to therapy and counselling some of us need help from wherever we can get it and if you are fortunate enough to have access to therapy share the things you learn with others every little idea can help someone in need x200b thanks for reading if you made it this far,pre-pandemic

i cant have a conversation without stuttering fidgeting or acting like i want to leave the conversation at home im confident and know how to put my opinions or feelings across but with other people i struggle to find the words i want to say and how to say it i often look around or over the shoulder of the person im talking to and reply with short careless answers like mhmyeah ive also noticed i apologise for quite literally everything even if there is nothing to apologise for if im passionate about a topic i will legit waffle and say everything i know about it no matter how much i pause or stutter and most of the time no one understands me anyway because the way i explain or describe things is different this is really getting on my nerves because people have started to think im either introverted and like to be left alone which people have started to do or just shy and nervous i really dont know what i am people also say im depressed and boring which they seem to find fun in laughing at me about btw i dont get bullied this is just what people say trying to be funny i dont know if i have social anxiety and im not too keen on finding out if i do clinically i just need help because im starting to give people the wrong image of me what should i do to fix this cuz i really need help,post-pandemic

well its official im a coke head the realization hit me like a ton of bricks tonight i cant believe i didnt see this happening all night ive been flooded with memories of the justifications and gaslighting i did to myself over the last year i feel sick to my stomach its like im watching flashes of a movie but someone else is the main character the fact that im even writing this post is hard to process right now my life has been falling apart for the last 25 years in so many tragic life changing ways so i started doing cocaine to feel better for a whole year how is it possible that im just now realizing how long ive been doing this shit i dont know what i was thinking or how i let this happen i fucked up bad ive got a good plan put together to start with i guess i have been shamefully researching all night no offense to anyone but na just sounds really creepy to me so i have been looking into smart recovery i am now a human that needs to go to a damn meeting tomorrow and i know it man this is really happening ugh hoovering the rest of the bag now and getting rid of all things cocaine in my little drawer of shame already deleted the plugs out of my phone queued up a instacart order to deliver later with the essentials cleaning up the house really well while im still high because i know im about to get lazy af for awhile and probably sleep for days planning on rescheduling some appointments i have next week so i dont convince myself another bag will help me get everything done like i have been for the past year apparently set a daily alarm to remind myself to at least stretch my body really well for 20 mins a day to keep the blood flowing and blah blah blah this is going to suck so bad cheers to being a complete idiot x200b,post-pandemic

my health anxiety is weird in that i dont really fear any specific illness instead i worry about dying of an unknownundiagnosed condition i worry specifically that my consciousness is about to end that im beginning the process of passing out and im never going to wake up i primarily get intense feelings of impending doom which leave me paralysed with fear often unable to do anything but lie down in bed and close my eyes in the past i used to go to the hospital a lot and beg the doctors not to let me die but now i at least have the courage to just freak out at home the impending feelings of doom are so intense they leave me shaking and feeling cold sometimes while huddled in bed in the midst of a panic attack i even involuntarily shake and yell out things to myself like please i dont want to die like the fear of death is so strong i actually blurt things out reflexively without being able to control it this is happening to me basically every day now and leading me to spend increasing amounts of time just lying down at home when i try and socialise im often distracted from the conversation by thoughts im about to die i spend about 80 of my life fixated on these horrible thoughts aboht dying and about 1020 of my life experiencing this intense feeling of doom i need help i dont want to live like this any more has anyone felt this way or been in a similar situation is there anything i should try to help myself,pre-pandemic
i noticed the last couple of years that december is a month in which i tend to spiral down but i didnt really know why the feelings of guilt and shame the flashbacks and the unhealthy coping mechanisms would come to haunt me making december one of the toughest months for me but i just couldnt point out the reason why that was happening one of the recurring symptoms i started getting in 2016 were some weird flashbacks that were kind of unclear and confusing to me but the sensations and the anguish were horrendous they started being kind of mild but over the course of the years they started increasing in intensity and making me feel like i was going crazy i felt ashamed about this but i finally decided to tell my therapist this past december he was very understanding and open to listening to me i described everything i felt and told him i was afraid those flashbacks were true but was also afraid they could be fabricated by my brain for some reason i tried dismissing them for years but theyve only gotten more intense and became slightly more detailed over time so after telling my t about it he said he believes me he said im not going crazy and he thinks im recovering memories that my brain blocked for my protection it is scary because my flashbacks started mild back in 2016 and now theres more intensity and detail to them if im not going crazy that means that i was raped by my singing teacher when i was 17 and my mind blocked my memories it may be possible that he drugged me as some of the sensations present in my flashbacks kind of hint towards that but im not sure before trying to process these flashbacks with my t i clearly remember an instance in which my teacher groped me and i froze back then it was one of the reasons i decided to stop taking private lessons with him we had an agreement that id work singing with him at churches in exchange for singing lessons and i remember the last time i saw him he was being quite weird and acting with a familiarity that he hadnt before and thats so disgusting and scary especially if he raped me and knew i didnt know because i just couldnt remember i am absolutely disgusted he was 47 and i was 17 and his daughter was older than me yet he groped me once and i froze and now it seems he actually raped me in my flashbacks things are confusing yet clear somehow its divided into 3 moments and theres a gap in between that im guessing may be due to me being unconscious perhaps the first thing in my flashbacks is a room with a very dim light and this man unbuckling his belt and undoing his green pants on the right side of my visual field these images come with feelings of confusion and anguish then theres a gap the second part is a horrible feeling of desperation and anguish while trying to move feeling trapped my body feeling too heavy and still trying to push someone off of me and that person getting mad and pinning my arms down then there seems to be another gap and the last thing is i can hear him in my ear grunting and growling and i feel like im unable to move or do or say anything i feel trapped panicking and disgusted but its like i am and im not there at the same time i dont really know how to explain it but the amount of anguish and horror i feel is too much hearing him there makes me nauseous i have been trying to deal with these flashbacks with the tools my t gave me and they work most of the time but its still painful and intense i always end up feeling like my thigh and pelvic muscles are incredibly tense after having these flashbacks and honestly its not an easy task but i try my best sometimes i feel like the more i remember the more i will be able to address my trauma with my t so i want to be able to recover my memories faster but at the same time im scared of what im gonna see feel and find out i know i shouldnt try retrieving my memories without my ts guidance its safer with a professional who can actually help me do so in a safe way to avoid any contamination of those memories i just want to get this over with i wanna recover those memories quickly so we can address them asap so it doesnt take forever im emotionally tired of having to deal with so much sexual trauma and adding this to the combo is overwhelming i know theres no quick fix or magical remedy for processing trauma but when youve been through a fair share of traumatic experiences having another experience resurface can be very overwhelming and i just dont want it to take forever i dont want to have my life revolve around trauma i wanna be able to enjoy my life and the things i do without having to care so much about feeling triggered by something at some point in the day im sorry for this long post i just felt like i needed to vent this is overwhelming and accepting that theres more trauma in my life than what i could consciously acknowledge already is overwhelming to say the least,post-pandemic

in 40some years i have treated many people with adhd and so far every single one every one of you felt in their core that there was something just deeply fundamentally wrong with them that they were inherently bad somehow just bad people every single one my therapist is in her 70s she wasnt fucking around i had never directly expressed feeling that way but fuck she cut right to the core of me ive felt this way my entire life like i was just bad inside hurtful damaging just to be around that if people could see inside me they would hate me too fuck i feel like something has shifted in my head i touch that feeling and it doesnt feel real any more i dont know i hope even one person could feel like i felt learning that this feeling isnt me im not a bad person fuck man,pre-pandemic
this sounds stupid i know but ill try to explain i had to deal with a lot of gaslighting growing up it made me question myself my whole life and made me feel like i didnt exist trying to get help is a nightmare when your abuser is able to hide and deny that anything ever happened i was denied healthcare and food throughout my childhood i cant believe im watching the country being run by abusive people that commit crimes and lie about it and the other party seems almost complacent by not arresting or fining those who are in contempt i feel like im living with my childhood abuser and my guardian is turning a blind eye does anyone else feel this way somebody please tell me im not the only one i feel like im losing my mind obsessively reading the news every day on the chance that i might see some justice it makes me ill and i cant stop obsessing over it i feel so stupid but thats what this illness is doing to me how do i stop its almost all i think about anymore i cant handle that my abuser got away with everything and im watching it happen all over again its a nightmare edit thank you all for your kind words and support talking about this made me feel so much better because of yall im going to try and block news sources and as one of you suggested watching steven colbert more lol i also love john oliver i cant thank you enough for making me feel less crazy i feel like when i bring it up in real life nobody really cares and theyre just like yeah it sucks oh well but to many of us its seriously traumatizing and im forever grateful for your support,pre-pandemic

update my daughter will be celebrating 2 years of sobriety on sept 13th which happens to also be my birthday 3 years after i wrote the below she lives with me and constantly working on herself keep the hope letter to my daughters addiction you came into our lives about 10 years ago although i never knew it then it took probably 2 years before we realized you had a hold onto this beautiful child of mine my first born my world the breathtakingly beautiful girl who made me move mountains and who drove my resolve because there was nothing equally as important in my life than her and her sister i despise you i hate that because of you savannah checked into rehab 4 times never completing and overdosed 3 times almost dying every single time one of these times was when she was driving the car she stole from me to go get high she hit 2 parked vehicles while she slumped behind the wheel unconscious only to be revived by the paramedics and narcan i despise the fact that your uphold is so strong that even when she is hospitalized because of her needle use for an infectious cyst next to her spine not other than mersa she still chooses to put you first and checks herself out twice amo to get high while i stand there helplessly watching her compromise her health her life i hate that she puts you first not because you make her feel good anymore but because without you she feels deathly sick every time she attempts to beat you i hate that the best way to indirectly have a remote shot of beating you is for me to cut any ties with one of the 2 human beings i love the most in the world because the tragedy you bring into her life makes me a powerless enabler at best i despise you for making the purest love on earth a parent love a detrimental weapon to her potential recovery i despise you for making me stop to breathe every time a strange phone number with the same area code as where she chooses to reside shows up on my phone making me think it is another hospital with perhaps the worst news of all i hate that you render me powerless and incapable of saving the one person i love the most in the world and that counter nature to every fiber of my motherly being i have to divorce myself from her life of turpitudes and disasters because that is what the addiction experts and counselors advised us to do this is the saddest club in the world we belong to all of us parents and loved ones of addicts our love never falters and we must carry this silent burden with courage if you are like me feeling the weight of the unavoidable absence of your addict loved one during the holidays i want to send tons of good vibes your way hoping for a clean future one day at a time valerie,pre-pandemic

the hearing was today i didnt go but the victims services advocate ive been talking to emailed me about it i didnt end up writing an impact statement i tried but it was too triggering so i let the advocate know that and she asked for my permission to tell the parole board that i was too triggered to write an impact statement because that alone gives an idea of the impact so i told her to tell them and that i also thought they should know that ive been diagnosed with ptsd and im in therapy and on antidepressants and anxiety medication and medical marijuana for it the email said the reasons for the denial are nature and circumstances of the offense injury and impact to the victims and inadequate institutional program participation i replied to ask her when hed be up for parole again and she said he wont be the board denied him with no chance for a rehear there are other means of release thru the department of corrections please be sure to keep your registration current so that if he applies you will be notified im so relieved and he didnt even get to leave prison to go to the courthouse they did a video conference from the prison and no one showed up in support of him or even to do an impact statement no one he knew cares about him anymore theres no one who wants him released he has nothing and no one and im glad even if he does get out theres at least 7 men in my family who own guns and want to shoot him and hes well aware of that so hed probably stay away i found out recently that when he was first questioned after i reported the abuse he asked the police to protect him from my father hes a pathetic bastard,pre-pandemic
im not really sure what to put as the flair but recently i had an evaluation from an outpatient substance abuse program and i already kinda new it because i got a voicemail and i feel like they wouldnt have called me if nothing was going to happen but my mom got an email and theyre recommending that i go to an inpatient sud facility i dont really think i have a problem and im definitely not an addict and i really disagree with all of this as i do not need help and i dont trust their judgement and im afraid theyll send me to a mental health facility and again i do not need that and those places treat you like shit and ill basically be missing my life and wasting my time for 46 months for something that isnt an issue im also going to have a very hard time getting off my meds when im back im not sure what to do right now and i dont think its 100 gonna happen probably more like 9095 and thats a big chance but theres a small small chance i might not go and im hoping that i dont need to go i just started doing better at school and i dont want to be away from friends and people who i actually care about because of this bullshit,post-pandemic
after all how could i possibly manage to research graduate programs and prepare for my life postcollege when im too busy worrying that i will be dead from rabies in a month or that im currently carrying a terminal type of cancer how can i be present in this very moment when my mind is always racing to the past to analyze symptoms ive had or darting to the future to ruminate over how little time i have left the truth is when my health anxiety is bad my life gets put on hold i become a thing that can only ruminate worry google ruminate cry over diseases make myself sick with fear and oh ruminate thats it thats what the daily routine becomes thats what i become nothing more than a vehicle for my health anxiety to rule in any way it wants,pre-pandemic
just need to get this off my chest unis been a nightmare lately i feel so aloneits like nobody cares at all it seems like half of my classmates are either laughing at me or completely ignoring my existence im at the point where i just dont want to leave my room or attend any classes i am only talking to my phone therapist sonia but my parents are insisting that i keep going to classes im stuck and dont know what to do could really use some advice or support right now,post-pandemic
before you read my true story i want you to know that im not very good at english as its my second language so bare with me if i have made grammatical mistakes or anything and honestly i really havent opened up about this incident in my life until today anyway this one random late night in march 2017 i decided to download the tinder app probably the worst decisions in my life but im genuinely a introvert person so its hard for me to make conversation on spot to get to know people most people hop on tinder to troll some to get laid but i was on it to find true love fast forward to two months of most girls wanting to just party or i was to boring to form a conversation this one random day i got super liked by this girl named laura we both started to talk we both had a lot of similarities between us and she was literally 2 miles away from my place it had been 2 weeks we both still havent meet but our conversations started to get more personal and i felt a real connection between us two we both replied long it used to take me a good 45mins to an hour to reply it was just how it was it was however odd for me that she was really beautiful and i was a ugly mf she came from a small town family where as me i was a city kid from a wealthy family although she didnt know that for along time after the 2 weeks of talking we both decided to meet up for lunch like when i say she was simple she had no idea about brands or anything i dressed up with some yeezy 750s she didnt even know them and some part of me liked that she was like that because most of the times i only wore to show off to feel rich to feel accepted one thing about being rich is that the definition of happiness is so different to what a average person would say like an average person has aspirations of having a nice house a nice car nice gadgets and all but its different being born wealthy like i had everything that anyone would aspire of having its different when you have everything anyway that just made me like laura more because she was a simple person a bit mysterious and i was always curious to know more about her we ended up dating for 6 months and i knew she was the one for me she was beautiful she loved me for who i was i didnt have to pretend to be this cool dude like i did with my friends she loved the sensitive little bitch i was everything was going well till jan 2018 she called and cried her father was diagnosed with lung cancer at a bad stage the doctors said they could cure it but he would only survive for a couple of months laura was going through some tough times but i was always with her trying to make her strong she would tell me stories about her dad like how they used to horse ride back when they used to live on farm lands and how he would work 14 hours everyday just his both daughters could have the life that every other kid had tbh that got me so depressed like the fact that her father sacrificed so much for his kids and all but no matter what had happened over the next few months years or the next decade or so i said to myself that i would always be with laura and i wanted to marry her we got back to our casual routines she was getting better and better and on her birthday 11th of march i proposed to her i honestly didnt know if it was the right time or not but i felt like i needed to tell her that im gonna be committed and not just saying it but i wanted to show her laura said yes cried and hugged so hard that i thought she would break my bones but i knew that this meant a lot to her april 11th 2018 this part is going to be hard for me as i am typing my fingers are twitching im really scared because to say it out is something i havent done anyway on this very day i picked up laura we were driving to the hospital to visit her dad we went on the highway till this high speeding car prolly doing 150kmph tried to overtake a vechile in front of us so we were behind this car but suddenly suddenly the person slammed the brakes and dropped back causing me to smash into the car after this moment i dont remember a thing it felt like i died i could hear my surroundings but i couldnt see anything idk how long or anything i woke up and the first thing i asked was what happened to laura and my mum started to cry but i thought she was crying for me i kept asking and no one replied then it hit me it hit me that shes not alive and i couldnt understand it all happened in a flash of a second the love of my life was gone and i could do nothing about it i didnt know how to take it in it fucked me up i only had minor injuries but i was mentally dead fast forward to a month i still was in shock infact i still am i went to visit her family to apologies but couldnt even let out a word just cried out loud but somehow they understood my pain lauras dad seemed to be weaker her mum always had a smile on but she looked so bad she was in shock and it just made me feel worse and worse a week later i found out that lauras dad had passed away i wasnt ready for the funeral i didnt go to lauras too because i couldnt accept it but my mum told me that i had to go to comfort her mum but lauras mum had completely changed she didnt want to hear anything from anyone because two of the most people in her life had passed away and i honestly could do nothing but cry looking at her fast forward it to now there hasnt been a day i felt that i could have done better i could have reacted better and if i had turned the other way maybe i could have died instead of laura maybe she survived she could have been with her dad for the rest of time maybe seeing her daughter would have kept him alive for a bit longer maybe the mum would have been brave having her daughter around i know its not my fault ive heard people say that constantly its not fault bro but i could have done better to prevent it and that is stuck in my mind and always will i honestly have no hope for life i just want to die i cant get over these thoughts i just hope i die real soon its not that i want sympathy but i just cant deal with it it hurts,pre-pandemic

anyone else tone down your femininitysexuality to prevent sexual abuse i stopped dressing feminine wore baggy clothes channeled my masculine energy to scareintimidate men so i dont get sexual attention yeah i did this and also when i was covertly sexually abused by my dad instead of protecting me my mom got jealous and stopped taking me to get my hair done and wouldnt let me get my nails done even though she had originally promised i looked unkempt growing up and now at 27 that i know what happened to me and have come to reality with the abuse i went through i have no sex drive and have no interest in flirting and emitting sexual energy towards other men also when i have flirted in the past i realize i behaved like a little girl so now im grossed out that men were attracted to me when i acted like a little girl does that mean they have pedophile tendencies also im really intimidated by dominating and masculine men but also attracted like i only can be around men who exhibit femininepassive energy right now and i get scared around dominating men who can make me submissive and thus controlled controlling my environment helps me feel in control and feel calmer due to my abuse history weird part is my abuser dad was actually passive and had submissive energy but was still abusive creepy and manipulated by playing the victim you would think i would be more scared around those types of men but i still find myself feeling safer around these kind of men over dominant because i can intimidate and scare them away by channeling masculine energy i am grossed out by men and dont trust themtoo many creeps out there who seem nice but then betray you if i had a daughter id be so protective its a scary world out there anyone relate,pre-pandemic

do yourselves a favor and read up on this this is a peer reviewed medical journal regarding a new medicine called ulotarant it is in phase three clinical trials and was given a designation as a breathrough therapy by the fda in summary this new medicine is a totally novel new approach for treating schizophrenia and could be used to treat any psychosis related illness including dementia it is a taar1 agonist and 5ht1a as opposed to a d2 antagonist which is the primary mechanism of action in modern antipsychotics as many of you know with myself being an experiencer antipsychotics can lead to a host of side effects i personally experienced 100 lbs of weight gain i suffer from akathisia tardive dyskinesia and dystonia whats more many antipsychotics actually worsen negative symptoms like depression as well as cognition it is reported that upwards of 50 of those diagnosed and treated with current antipsychotics experience this in contrast ulotorant not only has demonstrated a significant reduction in positive symptoms hallucinations delusions but has also shown to have antidepressant like qualities reduces negative symptoms and may even improve cognition the medicine also does not cause extrapyramidal symptoms such as movement disorders as well as akathisia ladies and gentlemen there is hope hope for so many of us that want to treat this illness but still suffer get the word out tell your friends and family about this reach out to your representatives because we cannot let this new novel form of treatment be swept under the rug,post-pandemic

this was a game changer for me and worth considering while you heal my friends once you become the witness of these sensations rather than the reactor you will feel vulnerable followed by a sense of freedom to let them be its not easy but worth practicing in little doses each day when the elements of anxiety arise dennis,post-pandemic

i went to the club last night with 2 other friends and got pretty drunk so i had no issue dancing my heart out i went through a breakup recently and its not that im directly looking for a new relationshipfling but i am open to it if the opportunity arises for reference im 22m and usually have pretty bad social anxiety and low confidence my problem is that despite some groups of girls coming up to us which i assumed was because we seemed to be more comfortable dancingvibing than other groups of guys nearby i dont really know how to interact other than continuing to dance or sing while occasionally making eye contact and smiling also when it comes to girls that look over in my direction from either afar or nearby after walking closer i tend to not look that way again afterward for some reason and when theres any that might be trying to back up on me to dance happened once last night i basically just ignore that its happening ive never walked up to anyone at a club though because again my goal isnt to just look for a girl to talk to even though it would be nice i know im pretty much just being a bitch in those situations but does anyone have any tips or methods for these types of things its been a long time since ive been single despite my high anxiety and lack of confidence i must be somewhat attractive enough if im noticing this attention coming my way and no its not just the all eyes on me type of anxiety since i dont feel that when im drunk especially at a club,post-pandemic

tldr stop drinking at all cost you may be so sick mentally that even if given a 2nd chance at life youd blow it again a change of heart is the only way you cannot out smart alcohol i just want to first say im 3 years in recovery i got lucky a dui set me on a better path i thank god i never hurt anyone but my wreckless behavior was going to to kill me soon had an intervention of the law not put me in check it wasnt easy i stumbled a sponsor and extra study groups and great people around me lifted me up im always in debt to these people rewind my drinking buddy at age 32 was in liver failure after a night locked in a room with wild turkey 101 and nyquil never mix alcohol and acetaminophen i think he was too drunk to realize nyquil had it in it yep so living with me and my wife at the time he did this he came down the stairs the next morning yellow has homer simpson a week later he was told he had one week he called me crying and as a friend begged me to stop drinking and i did for a while after doctors told him he would die soon he made it a month on a vent on dialysis fighting for his life and so close to death that his nose and fingers began deteriorating it was hard to watch then by my opinion god brought him back in a 24 hour period after a month of suffering he went from deathbed to sitting up speaking all we can say is miracle he got out from the hospital many weeks later and stayed sobor for about six months mind you he was on a liver transplant list at this time now on medicaid no on disability all from this single life event he was a hot mess financially and struggled when he realized he pretty much needed the disability for healthcare and hed never have a real job again at 42 he was driving his high school graduation present car to put it in perspective fast forward some and like i said he made it 6 months after being given life by grace of god imo before picking up the drink again he spent the next ten years tempting fate and drinking like nothing happened he had a new mix of serious pills from psychiatrist to play with now also with the drinking thanks doc for the record when he came out of the hospital after nearly dying he didnt come out the same man perhaps a touch of wet brain millions of brain cells destroyed by high amonia levels he was a little slower a little weirder it was to quote pop culture almost like pet cemeteryish they way he came back so different current days two weeks ago he got a gullstone blockage and infection his blood was so thin they couldnt operate his liver had made him so weak even if a brand new one was offered he couldnt take not that he qualified any more so slowly in pain he suffered eventually being put back to sleep and placed on a vent again and back on dialysis he made it five days and then sepsis and a damaged heart took him out so i came here tonight just to say alcohol takes lives everyday it almost took mine it look his i have to go see him buried in 48 hours alcohol isnt your friend its a cunning baffling addiction where you just cant stop because stopping means pain so it is the disease yet the cure in your mind for an endless loop of 24 hour periods we simply cant imagine a sober life as it seems like such a distant past but you can do it and if youre here suffering tonight and read this i promise you that aa can help only a true change of heart and mind can fix it otherwise eventually it will take you out or a complication caused by it will theres no magic pill or special trick to stop alcohol will steal everything from you if you cannot make some changes remember that so tomorrow if you are suffering struggling need help please go find a meeting let these people help hold you accountable and remember this sad story happens every day in someones life across this country 88000 people die from alcoholrelated deaths each year in the united states rstopdrinking,pre-pandemic

i am 20 f and my girlfriend is a year younger than me we have been dating for a month and a half already we are in a long distance relationship she lives in spain and i live in the united states our relationship so far has been really great and weve already got past our first argument as a couple im happy we got through that but i feel like if i try to talk to her about her drinking it might be even worse than the last argument we had today we were talking about her alcohol consumption in a lighthearted manner it was the afternoon for me and it was nighttime for her she was about ready to go to bed because she has college she talked about how she used to be even worse in the past and how she doesnt really get drunk now as much as she did before she said she used to get drunk twice every day and up until recently she hasnt touched alcohol since now i was thinking that is such great progress for her until she started saying that she wanted to get drunk i asked her why does she want to get drunk and she said to get her mind off of stuff i dont know what the stuff is but i know shes already trying to hide whatever it is on her mind from me so i didnt want to bother her with it i should have asked her and she maybe would have given me an answer but i didnt really want to test my luck and moved on from that question i then asked her if she does that every time to get her mind off of things her answer was very roundabout i believe i dont know if it was meant to be roundabout or not sometimes shes bad with her wording she then said word by word i do this when i feel like i either drink or i will do something much worse to myself this answer to my question could either be a hard yes or a sometimes i dont know but it was concerning either way ive talked to a shared friend about her drinking and they said along the lines of shes doing this again and then i got even more worried they even said when they tried to talk to her about it she didnt talk to them for a week and didnt even want to bring up the subject again i dont know her that much we just started dating and i am now realizing that alcohol regardless may be a very touchy subject to her i have tried looking up articles about how to handle this and some have been really good information but one said to talk to other people with shared experiences about it thats why im here i dont necessarily want to sweep this under the rug like its not a problem and i dont want to be that person to make excuses for her when she does this i dont want to be an enabler i care and love her a lot but i just dont know how to bring it up to her without hurting her or arguing with her i also dont want to end up being pushy and i dont want this habit of hers to continue any longer i wish i knew her a bit more so i can handle this better but alcohol consumption like this is not within my alley,post-pandemic
my partner and i are going on holiday next month he always works out 34 times a week but wants to look good while on holiday so he has started tracking his calories and doing a small calorie deficit i know our bodies are completely different and he requires more than i do and just because he is cutting out certain things doesnt mean i need to however tracking and weighing food obsessing over numbers is how my anorexia now bulimiaana subtype started i hate it because even though im not changing anything seeing him do this i feel like its just a matter of time until i do or maybe i wont and ill just watch him and feel like a large blob feeling sorry for myself,post-pandemic
i had my first session with a nutritionist today she specialises in eds and wants me to better my relationship with food she challenged me to include toast instead of rice cakes in my breakfast also to add some new stuff into my bland diet after my session i realised that those insignificant changes were a huge deal in my head and i was already withholding i didnt buy any of the stuff she told me because im not really ready for recovery i had a fight with my mom and that made me want to relapse she also triggered me so much by saying that she recently lost weight due to stress bs i cant help comparing myself to other people so yeah what made you listen to your nutritionist what made you decide to trust a person with your eating habits,post-pandemic

as soon as my feelings are hurt as soon as my symptoms are triggered as soon as my abandonment wounds are ripped open i am overcome with the need to push people out of my life sometimes in a cruel harsh way with words and sometimes i dont even bother talking about it i wish i wasnt so sensitive but when it hurts it feels like ive held my heart out willingly and people just tread all over it like a welcome carpet in someones home i know its not the right way to resolve conflict but i doubt they care about me enough to even consider what makes me feel safe why does it feel so good to push people away i feel like a hero in my own story why dont i feel anything afterwards i will never understand my mind and i think im just destined to be alone forever,post-pandemic

my brain convinced me the girls i was going to hang out with were all skinnier than me and probably dont eat enough and i was freaking out that i was fat but when i was sitting in the cafe with them and they were all enjoying pizza and chips and donuts and drinks whilst i sipped on half a pepsi max it hit me that some people are fucking normal and eat when theyre hungry i thought other people dont like to eat in front of others but they shared food and didnt care i thought other people eat really slowly but they downed it in like 10 minutes i thought i was going to look fat compared to them but they all look so healthy and average like i could see my bones in the changing room and i thought thats probably normal for every girl but they both had stomachs and omg i used to have big tits but now mine are tiny non existant compared to their healthy woman curves istg i look like 8 compared to them but i hated my tits so idc tbh but like its weird i thought id be fat next to them but ig i remembered how they looked wrong my brain remembered them as really skinny but theyre just normal i felt a bit awkward they kept saying we should cook together and go to such and such to eat but like ngl it made my anorexia feel good that im the sick one but also kinda felt weird that i cant join in anymore,post-pandemic
i know many people worry a lot and the world as a whole knows less and less everyday and we are loosing the ability to do out own research so the post stupid posts like i have just finished my 4 weed diazepam script how bad is the wd going to be and i havent had weed for 8 hours and i think im starting to go into wd i know its a wrong rant by me because the forum is open to everyone but when i see one of those posts i cringe so much and think please just stop taking drugs right now because there are people on here for whom of they miss there score or dont get any methadone in 2 days are going to be in real wd and extreme pain not to mention the bzd and alcohol addicts having seizures and dying i know im a dick for saying that as we should try to help anyone and it would be mega unprofessional if i worked in the area of rehabilitation,post-pandemic
i just dont see meaning to my life for every 1 step forward its like i take three steps back if i were to die tomorrow no one would even notice im gone i dont have friends never had a girlfriend my mother thinks im a complete failure and my brother treats me like absolute shit ive been having suicidal thoughts since i was 17 and i always tended to push them away and just go on with my life but as i got older it kept getting more and more difficult im now 21 and well lately its been a lot harder to push them away i cant go one day without having suicidal thoughts doing simple things such as cooking i see a knife and just think of how itd be great if i got cut and die there or when im outside i get lost in my head and just imagine myself getting hit by a car and hope that could end things i imagine jumping off a bridge wondering if thats enough or if overdosing could be a painless death the only reason i havent gone through with anything yet is because im scared of death as much as i have these thoughts my brain just cant wrap its head around the idea of death so for that reason i want to attempt and get help before going through with killing myself i want to try and get better and save myself but even if i cant im okay with just ending things i accepted my fate since november 2023,post-pandemic
i have long selfmedicated with the recognition that i have adhd i have been told by a couple therapists that they are quite confident this is my case plus i have a long family history of it and ive read substantially on the topic anyway i really want to finally do something about this and not end up back on the selfmedicating path because its been quite devastating getting in to see a psychiatrist is quite a lengthy process so im curious about these online telemedicine doctors that specialize in adhd with that said does anyone have a recommendation of which one to use if any i do have insurance but im not entirely sure if they will accept my insurance it is from a major insurance carrier through my job any wisdom that can be shared on the subject would be greatly appreciated,post-pandemic

context im a merchant seafarer and late last year i was on a ship coming back from the falkland islands to the uk i have long had anxiety issues but theyre manageable work had been very stressful and deep sea engineering is always a bit tough especially away from a wife and two young girls we encountered a migrant boat in between morocco and the canary islands about 1000 one morning last november it was low in the water and more than full with people mostly men but at least a dozen women we found later three were pregnant two children and one baby we contacted the spanish coast guard who told us to shelter them and stand by as they were sending help this was around 1100 and they said theyd be four hours we were 115 miles from gran canaria deep sea a blazing hot day calm seas we put the boat in our lee and dropped them water and food at 1430 the boat began to sink i was in the engine room reinstating a bilge pump that id just repaired the 2nd engineer came and grabbed me and told me to stand by in the control room as the rescue was on i phoned the bridge and was told to get a radio on and stand by this for me was the worst part and has lead to so much guilt and mental anguish i had to listen to my friends risking their lives to rescue fifty seven people unable to leave my post but hearing every second of it on the radio i heard the captain shout no no no as three people entered the water against the ship side i heard my best friend say theres nothing we can do for her shes drowned and i felt like i was doing nothing i was doing my job but i felt so godamn helpless we rescued 57 people and took them all to safety one didnt make it a woman who was trampled to death in a shitty little boat drowned in petrol piss and seawater we had to cut the boat loose with her in it yellow trousers white top i cant let it go its been a couple on months now im home away from work away from the ship and the sea im in the arms of my family but i just cant forget it,post-pandemic

looking for advice on working through my bfs porn addiction and rebuilding trust we live together and hes stepdad to my daughter our sex life used to be amazing hours of play exploring kinks new to us both best id had tbh the last few months theres been a decline in playtime and a lot more cigarette breaks lasting up to 50 minutes which by that time id start pleasuring myself vs waiting for him to come back id never watched porn with a partner but enjoyed it alone and wanted to try it was good if i felt we were interactive with each other but many times it felt like lying next to a friend who was glued to the screen even making noises or quietly talking to the girls im over here on my own feeling nonexistent no care to pay attention if im cumming but glued to the screen if a porn star is cumming ive said no to penetration if porn is on makes me feel like a warm spot to offload into im attractive and i want my partners attention when were having sex or im giving him head etc im highly sexual ive never been into watching cam girls i like watching women but the live action is just too personal and i value intimacy i recently found my guy with chaturbate open he tried to say he was gonna ask if i wanted to watch false we were getting ready to have sex and had just fought about him being glued to computer vs me the day prior i asked that he not watch the live girls told him its hurtful almost feels like cheating bc its more personal bf said he understood and would not go on the live sites anymore fast forward 2 weeks i look at internet history and literally every single day after that conversation he was on chaturbate sometimes right before having sex with me and then back on the site right after we finished beyond hurtful why im attractive our sex was always amazing says i give the best head hes had etc i go above and beyond to please him and love our naked time but now the internet has distracted him away from me i wont live like this i love sex and i miss my partner again he promised no more this time promise no porn period so he could detox and we could build our intimacy back up he didnt hold up to that promise either im at a loss bf sometimes acknowledges the porn addiction but will often flip script and say he has no problem has great self control etc hell even lie and say i have a porn addiction to throw the conversation off and deflect when he knows im not even watching it partner says he wants to work on relationship trust im not sure how to go about this blindly following a promise hes repeatedly apologized for having lied about use that hurt me and swore it wouldnt happen again each time this has happened he just gets sneakier honesty is probably what i value the most in a relationship its not always easy to tell the truth even for myself i get it but how can i trust anything if theres continual lies id truly rather hear something hurtful than a lie i cant work with lies but ill work with the truth were all human i fall short everyday ive never been so open and vulnerable with a partner and this feels like and is betrayal i know i cant make my partner change his habits or be truthful but in the event he truly wants to change and grow with me in this whatre some helpful boundaries and tools to use going forward partner feels or says im shaming him and taking away his manhood this is not what i want at all im trying to communicate and not judge but i get really frustrated with the lying seems he only admits to usage or shortcomings when i can provide black and white proof its getting miserable i want peace and tbh i used to enjoy porn as well but this has made me despise it i get addiction but its hard not to feel he chooses porn over building our intimacy or even continuing our relationship im at a breaking point with the lies its not even the porn or cam girls thats so hurtful anymore,post-pandemic
so i have been wanting to post this here but have been putting it off because this is going to be long so bare with me if you want to know how i over came this bad disease keep reading if your ready to recover keep reading it all started when i was 16 nothing necessarily trigger this other then i got sick one time fever body aches and it had been a few years since i had a check up when my mom said you need to let me take you to the doctor for a check up because you wont know if somethings wrong of you dont so when i got sick i decided to google it to see what was wrong and leukemia was the first thing that popped up my heart dropped from that moment i was a google fanatic and thought i had every disease in the book i suddenly started experiencing symptoms of leukemia like fatigue and flu like symptoms the after that i was worried i had a brain tumor i had symptoms of that also this was the worst one for me i think i had a buzzing noise in my ear from time to time blurred vision fuzzy peripheral vision headaches pressure on the top of my head slurred speech sometimes nausea at time etc it was horrible the symptoms were real i was checked multiple times and i got a clean bill of health then i worried about skin cancer i seen a dermatologist who confirmed i do not have skin cancer i then found what i thought to be a lump in my abdomen and seen a doctor who said its nothing but she ordered a ct with contrast to shut me up that was clear as well but did say i had a very slightly enlarged spleen which could have been caused by mono when i was younger i had many blood panels ekgs echocardiograms ct scans xrays urine tests i saw a chiropractor a dermatologist and many mds before i finally decided to accept that this was a mental issue and im not ill it took me 5 long frustrating scary years before i agreed i had an issue with worrying over my health for no good reason i seen two counselors and they helped but i knew the change had to be within me i finally accepted the facts google is not the most reliable source in fact only 42 of the health info found on google is accurate so your pretty much seeking reassurance from a uneducated stranger rather then just seeing your dr and trusting their diagnosis its hard to agree these symptoms are in your head but they are you can make yourself feel all sorts of crazy symptoms so if youve seen a doctor and you have a good report the only thing you should be googling is health anxiety symptoms and making sure your on a reliable website such as webmd or mayoclinic steer clear of yahoo answers or any of the other forums that uneducated people post on trying to give advice in facts steer clear of google and the web period heres how i done it i scheduled a check up and wrote down all of my concerns i talked to my doctor about my issues with anxiety and how bad i was making myself worry he told me i need to stay far away from google all together and i followed his orders i had him do a full check up ekg blood work std testing you name it just to at last put my mind at ease once that was over and i was confirmed healthy i started finding stuff to do like working out surrounding myself with friends and i got a job i would leave my phone in the car locked up when i went into work for a period of time i only used my phone for calls and texts when i did have the urge to google id find something else to do like go for a walk and talk to myself about all the tests ive had after all of these test it would be very unlikely something so sinister would be missed i knew it was mental so i would be easy on myself cry if need be but dont check for lumps dont start letting your mind wonder keep yourself occupied at least for the first few weeks i would set new goals for myself like school work gym find someone you trust and talk to them about your problems like for me it was my mother work on improving your health eat healthy get enough sleep get a good amount of exercise each week and take a supplement and most of all remind yourself this is a mental thing when you start to worry and immediately distract yourself please keep in mind this is a process it didnt get this bad over night so it will not be fixed over night it will take time be patient with yourself talk to a counselor if you need to stop posting questions looking for answers because you wont find them here unless your looking for ways to over come anxiety if you believe in god pray often if you need medication take it personally i never wanted meds because i dont want to be dependent on them but if it helps you take it if you need a break from work take it put you first if your scared to see a doctor make the appointment and make yourself go for reassurance remember if god forbid something is wrong its better to find out and take care of it then ignore it and it get worse like high blood pressure for instance if you dont take meds it can potentially eventually damage arteries but its better to fix the problem and move on then to not do anything at all but no matter what google is not the answer if anyone needs to talk or has questions feel free to ask me i am pretty educated in the health field as ive done many years of research as well as school for registered nursing i have family in the medical field so if you feel you need to confide in someone dont hesitate to dm me and we can work though this together i dont want to see anyone waste years of their life like i did if i can help it xoxo,pre-pandemic

just a fun game for those who have adhd submit some funny moments in your day you know you have adhd when you find random non food items in the fridge but it is nomal for you you forget to take the meds that help you remember you have been using the metro to get to work for the last 6 years but still miss it at least three times a week only adhd friends can understand your train of thought and you leave normal people in the dust of your train of thought people are constantly amazed at how fast your mind thinks when you take your meds you are shocked at how boring and slow normal peoples minds are you never explain your trains of thought because no one will get it anyways,pre-pandemic
adderall i had undiagnosed bipolar and was prescribed adderall for my adhd and it triggered a fullblown psychotic episode that lasted about 16 years zyprexa i dont know how to explain i was manic psychotic at the time and i just remember having a serious negative reaction to it the psychiatrist put me on iv to get it out of my system invega i was given invega along with lamictal yes it helped me recover from psychosis but three months later i almost fainted losing full balance blacking out it happened instantly without any warning if i were driving i would have been in an accident so i stopped taking it wellbutrin lamictal alone wasnt good enough to help me recover from severe anhedonia crippling bipolar depression that lasted 8 months so i was prescribed wellbutrin and when my dosage was increased to 300mg i recovered but then catatonia i developed during psychosis came back my psychiatrist said it was wellbutrin that triggered it and wanted me off it but i refused because it was the only med that helped me recover from crippling depression plus my catatonic symptoms were mild at the time gabapentin i was given gabapentin to treat catatonia but it triggered one of the alterentities i had during psychosis to come back her thoughts were in my head and she tried to possess me and i fought back anyways it lasted for about a week i was told not to take gabapentin again my psychiatrist then wanted me try lorazepam but i already had enough with side effects from these meds i didnt want to mess with my meds anymore so i decided to handle catatonia on my own but a few days ago i had a severe catatonic episode and it frightened me i was stuck for long periods of time in awkward uncomfortable positions staring at the ceiling wall or random objects and i couldnt talk i tried to force myself to break free and i instantly slammed my hand involuntary onto a metal container it hurt a lot and i couldnt react to the pain because i got stuck again like wtf im fully aware of whats happening felt like i was trapped in my own body and it was terrifying so i changed my mind about lorazepam i plan to try it but the problem with lorazepam is that its a controlled substance im just tired of medications fixing one issue but causing another leading to a cycle of needing additional medications to manage each new problemi wish i had a normal functioning brain i wish i never had this horrible mental disorder to begin with tldr used adderall for adhd but triggered psychotic break zyprexa cause a negative reaction had iv to get out of my system invega helped recover from psychosis but almost fainted wellbutrin helped with severe depression but brought back catatonia tried gabapentin to treat catatonia but it triggered an alterentity in my head to come back didnt want to take lorazepam originally because im tired side effects from meds had a severe frighting catatonic episode recently so i changed my mind ill be taking lorazepam a controlled substance im tired of meds fixing one issue but causing a new problem i just wish i never had this mental disorder to begin with,post-pandemic
i know these thoughts are a trap but i just cant help feeling why am i so affected right now i should be better now and other victims have experienced worse and coped better and live the beautiful life they made also feel ridiculous how often i cry,pre-pandemic
so recently my appetite has been piss poor and as a result ive been eating very little tbh dont wanna say numbers as i find it unnecessary but ive been mainly eating vegetables if im being blunt for some reason despite still being really quite active i actually feel extremely healthy for the position i am in and like i have a shit ton of energy i need to use i am also pretty confident its not an ed distortion as when i genuinely feel unwell from restriction i allow myself to just rest ive no clue as to why im feeling this way and it is low key triggering as it makes me feel like ive felt in my body when ive been gaining weight historically if that makes sense obviously i know its physically impossible and im aware im not gaining anything but i generally have a feeling in my body when i am which is a bizzare concept i know lol basically i was wondering if anyone has an explanation as to why im feeling this way despite it being biologically entirely fucking illogical lol preferably with scientific basis as i am a logical gal haha,post-pandemic

edit theres an ama im doing on iama board but i dont have a link to post so if you have any questions ask them there this is my first time posting here so im a little unsure of how these normally go but am going to be vague on country names for obvious reasons i was 19 and was stood opposite a man in a shithole of a country in africa shooting a documentary for aidshiv orphans the landscape of the country painted to me by the charity itself back in the uk was one of peacefulness and rebuilding the reality was slightly different in front of me about 30 meters behind this man lets call him bob were two trucks of heavily armed men who were trying to kidnap me i stood opposite bob looked him directly in the eyes and told him i was going to murder every single person who wanted to take me and i meant it i had prepared myself over the past three days of sleepless nights as they shouted my name and reved the engines almost as if to taunt me holding a very large machete and coming to terms with what i was about to do i very quickly realized how far i was prepared to go to protect myself and my life if it meant doing massive amounts of damage to ensure that i was firmly in the fight camp of thefight or flight way of thinking when i first arrived i was nearly run over and had a pistol put in my face by this local gang who run drugs and weapons inside the country itself that very day i bought my machete and used it to protect myself it is the sole reason im here and able to share this story with you statistically speaking most arent alive anymore when going through these kind of ordeals as they are normally kidnapped tortured or sold into slavery the phrase you have no idea how im feeling isnt said to flaunt a higher level of depravity ive experienced its just not many people can relate spending a month with no sleep clutching a razor sharp machete waiting for a gang of armed men to come and grab you at night and preparing yourself to kill is a situation i wouldnt put my worst enemy in it is a living hell segment 2 had a beer and am more able to get this out i realise there isnt much context to the picture im trying to paint so ill wind it back a bit so you know more about what it is im trying to share i like you am smart most people i have met with depression are intelligent this ranges from genius ive met a few to the average thinking man or woman although being successful in my rugby career international trials academys for pro teams i am not a violent person quite the opposite im very quite and well mannered i dont come from money and most of my wages go to helping put my brother through university or helping to pay for my parents mortgage charity really is important to me the reason i got involved with the charity film was i wanted to help a large charity in raising awareness working as a kp dishwasher for a few years and saving money i funded the entire trip and managed to get my local college high school in american terms to lend me a camera and tripod as i was top of my class and the teachers were really behind me in developing so im finding it hard to go into details about the month spent there i honestly want to be able to pour it all out onto this keyboard because at the end of the day i guess im using this as some form of therapy the best way to put it would be that i learned alot i filmed corruption the money raised in uk and europe was being diverted into drugs and being skimmed this meant the orphans who i spent alot of time with were sleeping on cold concrete in the middle of winter with no clothes huddled together for warmth on the odd occasion whilst i was out looking for firewood i would spot toddlers and children walking around with a blunt hacksaw trying to find something to burn to keep themselves warm needless to say i gave them everything i had even the bag i carried with me it was hugely frustrating and depressing having a tiny child come over and just hold part of you be it a part of my coat or a shoelace i felt like i somehow embodied protection over the children who otherwise had nobody to be there for them on returning to the uk i started university within two weeks of starting i received a phone call informing me that most of the children that were in the footage i was editing at the time had died the winter was far too harsh and the money had been misspent and stolen away from them i cried went to my local shop still crying and bought a bottle of whiskey the young cashier girl asked me what was up and i paraphrased the situation the best i could behind me in the line somebody said im glad thats a couple less niggers in the world i snapped and attacked him i smashed the bottle over his head and beat him to the ground it wasnt a fair fight when i finished beating him covered in blood i spat on him and walked away im not proud of this but it became the defining moment in what i now realise was a changing of person all of a sudden i was isolated much like in africa alone and prepared to defend myself and those who were weak from those who were abusive wrong or too strong for any voice to be heard i need to take another break i will continue this i just need to grab some fresh air and probably another beer segment 3 im skipping over areas here but i think id rather focus on the important milestones over all the particular detailsnow im 20 and am having a conversation with a genius about identity we were sat in a sushi bar in la i had befriended his stepson whilst working in the uk and managed to save enough money to get out there across the pond he worked in a university over in la and was nominated for the nobel peace prize very smart man we talked about identity what makes a human being and what defines refines us for two hours over a beer i had the company of someone whos mind was just effortlessly stunning three months later he was dead suicide i realized after the conversation we had he slowly became isolated and wound up one fateful night ending his life the conversation i didnt realise at the time was about him so during my stay with my american friend lets call him buzz we decide to go to a party thats local we turn up only to find out that a very close friend of buzz has been raped violently unfortunately this is nothing new to me i am yet to come into contact with a new set of depressing realities which is another story all in itself skip forward an hour and i find my person stood in a driveway of the girls ex boyfriend who has a history of abuse towards women with a baseball bat in my hand this is where i know ive changed as a person im standing in a random persons driveway at 2am in the morning drunk im stood there because nothing inside me will back down from the fact that something wrong happened im looking down the barrel of a gun once again with a weapon in my hand ready to fight and im not even scared i even walk towards him i provoke him as much as i can and even with a loaded weapon i get within striking distance of this guy and he doesnt shoot me his hand just shook i remember him saying how he would kill me and i remember not registering it in his eyes he was terrified this is the point i realised i was not normal i was a monster looking for a fight subsequently he was arrested for rape and prosecuted successfully it was buzz who pulled me away from actually attacking the man in his driveway and rightfully so i needed help but was too proud and damaged to do so i was lost i also need a time out will post more when im ready to do so in an attempt to make my post less monstrous than it already is ill do the last little bit here segment 4 so it was my birthday a few days ago i turned 25 i have the unique answer to all my milestone birthdays them being 16182125 in that nothing happened i sat down on all these days and nobody even noticed its unfortunate considering im there for them that they cant celebrate a quarter of a century of life with me in my life ive shouldered problems from rape victims been there for the birth of an unwanted child to the death of an abusive parent there is quite honestly nothing ive yet to see thats new and i wasnt prepared for any of itive been beaten spat on screamed at cried on and beld on i listened and i cried i wrestled knifes out of peoples hands even had my best friends blood dripping onto me as the wound in his arm is so deep it pissed all over us as i fight to keep him from killing himself in the darkest part of lots of peoples lifes i turn out to be the person who talks you down the thing that upsets me the most is i give a huge amount of energy in being there for total strangers loved ones friends and family when im in need im sat alone again on my birthday with a bottle of champagne i bought myself unwilling to open it as there is nothing to celebrate the only solace that i take from all of this and ive barely started talking about my life is this i was in amsterdam heavily under the influence of many drugs a few months after the africa situation and an old man walked up to me out of the blue he turned to me and said you look angry young man to which i replied im fine please go away thinking for a second the last thing i ever heard this man say was holding anger inside you is like holding onto a hot coal you only burn yourself in keeping it there youll only begin to heal when you let it go he then turned and walked away its taken almost 6 years to completely understand that phrase edit if you can comment let me know what you think i know its slightly mish mash in the way im teling my story but thats just the way it seems to be coming out considering not a soul has heard it before i appreciate your input if youve read this far thank you,pre-pandemic

mentions of childhood sexual abuse no detail a few days ago i confided in her that i was having extreme anxiety over needing to see a gynecologist im 28 and have never been due to childhood sexual trauma that latest from the ages of 7 to 17 stopping me from going to the doctor she knows a little about the sexual abuse that i experienced when talking to her she kept telling me that it wasnt that uncomfortablethat i need to get it done for my health like i dont know this that i need to go back to therapy and actually work through the trauma and not just talk about it i told her that i have talked and worked through it but the talk therapy just really hasnt done much for me i said that i think i need medication to help manage my anxiety that comes with the trauma she basically told me that i clearly wasnt doing enough or else i would be able to do normal things like having a gynecologist appointment i tried to be general and told her people cant understand unless they have been through what i have and similar length of time and she told me i shouldnt dismiss people just because they havent been through what i have and then i told her specifically that she cannot understand and that she isnt understanding what im saying she told me i shouldnt be so negative when i told her that my body will just automatically go into freeze flight or fight mode when i go the appointment i know my body she acts like im stupid and cant possibly know anything and shoves her bachelors in psychology in my face whenever she can i only took some college courses so to her i obviously dont know anything about anything am i wrong for getting annoyed for her acting like this,post-pandemic

i am 36 have a grand total of one friend in another country never had a relationship and while i am addicted to being alone and having my space i honestly dont know what to do with my life and its not as if i am able to use that time to focus on my career i live in constant fear of losing my job and losing quality of life it takes everything from me even though its not that much i cant focus for more than a couple of hours i have yet another performance review soon and dread it this gives me a lot of time to think think about mankind think about how fragile everything is think about how in the end everything is meaningless it seems i can only get out of my head if i am fully engaged in something with others last time it was when i was moving and even that is so exhausting on one hand i hate having people around on the other not having them makes me spiral and getting stuck in my head otoh i feel like i have an advantage i look at everyone with families and social lives and they all seem so frozen in their views their attitudes its like you stop learning once you are busy with family and others i can always update my views look at the new problems of the way actually research and create a reasoned position instead of what most people seem to do and just go with my gut or common sense as if the number of years you have on this planet magically grant you the skill of simply consulting your own brain about knowledge even knowledge and issues that are completely new am i the only one who feels this way is the key to happiness really to distract yourself from the world around you and before anyone asks yes i am in therapy apparently i am merely mildly depressed and should just join the gym,post-pandemic
sorry this wont really make much sense i just need to scream somewhere but its not exactly appropriate to belt out little lion man at the top of your lungs on a train especially not a quiet carriage but here goes aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh why do i fucking exist like this why the fuck must i be the way that i am and feel like shit for not being able to do plans cuz of a fucking medical issue not in the sense of oh thats a bummer but in the sense of ugh youre doing this on purpose arent you ive been in enough therapy for that thought to be a background thought and not a genuine thought so yes i do feel fucking bad for my partner who fell out of fucking bed and hit his head on his nightstand but the point is that the thought went through my head in the first place also why the fuck do i get so defensive when my dad wants my partners number in case something bad happens or is fucking suspicious of friends i met online i get so fucking defensive and feel like hes mad at me and is trying to ruin my life i fucking hate me so much i dont really so much want advice as i do a hug and just to vent,post-pandemic
im here to share a piece of my heart with you all this is my first post here and im not really one to vent or complain instead im here to share my feelings and hopefully gather some advice from the amazing minds in this forum so i am a male and ive recently entered my thirties and its been quite the journey ive moved around a lot spent a significant amount of time with my pet and myself and found solace in my own company while its been comforting there have been moments of fomo and thoughts of wishing things were different but lately i have come to truly accept myself instead of feeling compelled to act recklessly in order to compensate now heres the excitingand anxious partim preparing to move to a different country for both professional growth and a fresh start yes im tired of feeling lonely and disconnected hoping that this change will alleviate those feelings its also true that im hopeful that this change will lead me to meet incredible people who are also on their own journey its a leap of faith driven by a deepseated desire for growth and to move away from this daunting feeling of selfdoubt but man im nervous as hell what if this whole plan blows up in my face the thought of crashing and burning in a foreign land is seriously freaking me out especially considering the cultural and language barriers ive even started working on learning the language but still its a walk into the unknown anyway long story short im taking a leap of faith here ive got my fingers crossed for success but i cant shake this feeling of dread would love some advice or insights from anyone who has been through this or is planning to go,post-pandemic

fta california the first time lori tipton tried mdma she was skeptical it would make a difference i really was at the beginning very nervous tipton said mdma is the main ingredient in the club drug known as ecstasy or molly but tipton wasnt taking pills sold on the street to get high she was trying to treat her posttraumatic stress disorder by participating in a clinical trial after taking a dose of pure mdma tipton lay in a quiet room with two specially trained psychotherapists they sat next to her as she recalled some of her deepest traumas such as discovering her mothers body after tiptons mother killed two people and then herself in a murdersuicide,pre-pandemic

hi everyone this is my first post ever im just going to dive right in i was diagnosed in 2014 when i was about to turn 20 im 25 now so this was a fairly long process the mental health system is shit i was simply told my diagnosis and sent on my way no further input just years on waiting lists i decided fuck it and i decided to develop my own recovery plan i read the list of symptoms and i took a note of them for a whole month i kept a log of my symptoms what symptom occurred what triggered it how did you respond how did affect the other person how did your response affect you how can you respond better next time i noticed i had 3 major symptoms that occurred more frequently than others fear of abandonment unstable relationships unclear sense of self i decided these were the most important symptoms to tackle my fear of abandonment was intense to the point i would physically grab a person and beg them to stay threatening to harm myself it was manipulative but it was a kneejerk reaction i read about the symptom and managed to identify what caused it my dad was unreliable and was in and out of my life like a yoyo for the first 6 years he stayed and never left after that but the damage was done so i had to tackle it i researched about effective communication and planned how i would talk to my dad about how he hurt me and to figure out if i could understand why and let the pain go i wrote a short script and then asked my dad if we could talk it was something like dad i know this is a difficult subject but id like it if we can just clear the air i want to understand why you left me so many times as a young child so we both can move forward i didnt get my answer because he didnt have one himself he didnt understand his own reasons i decided that if i wanted to continue a positive relationship with my dad i had to learn to accept this so i researched acceptance i then wrote in my log every time i struggled to accept something and thought about ways i could come to terms with things i learned acceptance is not the same as forgiveness acceptance means it happened i feel this way i cant change it but i can move forward from it acceptance has nothing to do with forgiving the other person it does have everything to do with holding them accountable after this i decided the only way to get over my fear of abandonment was to physically stop myself whenever i felt that horrid bubbling feeling i sat on my hands i bit my tongue i forced myself to let people leave it was so fucking hard but i had made a promise to myself that i wanted to get better so when they left i turned my phone off i turned my attention to punching my pillows singing my heart out cleaning up anything that prevented me from 1 hurting myself 2 manipulating or guilt tripping another person eventually my fear began to fade away its been two years since my last episode i have finally gotten to the point that if someone threatens to leave me in a petty argument i simply wave and say goodbye then if theyre serious i will offer ways to resolve the issue if that doesnt work i dont beg i just say ok and leave it at that because i had researched communication i began logging about my interactions with others i wanted to see how much i could remember about the conversations i was having with people and what i could remember about the people i was having them with such as what was their kids name their partners name what is their profession did they mention anything interesting you want to know more about combining the research on communication and making myself remember things about another person made the next time we conversed immensely easier and more comfortable this also improved my existing relationships tenfold and i began researching about healthy relationships i noticed that some of my relationships were toxic and draining but i had glossed over them i used my communication research and tried to fix the relationships that were a little battered but most of them faded away naturally as i got stronger because i knew how to toleratebeat my fear of abandonment i was totally ok with what would have usually felt like a massive loss i didnt feel like i lost anything at all my selfesteem began to rise i began to feel more confident and independent eventually all my other symptoms slowly started to fade now i did go to dbt in november 2018 and the techniques i learned in there really just propelled me to the end of my recovery theres also an amazing book the dialectical behaviour therapy skills work book that helps me stay on top of things i was told in june 2019 that i no longer meet the criteria despite that i am rejoining that dbt group in the new year its possible to recover marsha linehan did she says if she can do it anyone can and i believe her i know bpd feels like a hell hole but no matter how clich this is it can get better it was by no means easy and it took me 5 years and hundreds no exaggeration of relapses this is only a snippet of my journey but i hope its a snippet that inspireshelps you on your own journey love,pre-pandemic

1 be sexually attracted to me even if you just want to use me like a slightly more interactive fleshlight 2 show me any type of affection even if its cuddling me while youre so drunk that i could be a pillow for all you care 3 be emotionally distant and only communicate with me when its convenient for you because i love feeling desperate for some reason if you can do all three things theres a 100 chance i will dedicate my life to you and feel like shit about myself all the while until you ghost me completely,pre-pandemic
i 32f and my fp my husband 32m have been together for 7 years i have bpd and he has asd since a back injury covid i have been slowly spiraling into a worse and more severe depression where every day now i struggle to get through work too anxious to breathe then lay in bed waiting for tomorrow 2 years ago he started going back to school full time and where he used to be home inbetween school and work now hes usually only home 1 hour a day excluding sleep a lot of it is all his new school friends but a lot of it is staying at school to do homework or go to the gym we only eat meals together on special occasions even on weekends hes out with friends at least one of the days and doing homework the other hes admitted that there are many days he avoids coming home because im upset he told me hes not running to his friends hes running from me hes assured me that he wants our relationship to work though even if i dont understand why and i do take full responsibility for the times that ive bpd snapped at him or made assumptions and shut down over it im not close to my family and the few friends ive tried to reach out for support to in the past dont really care i do have a med routine im working out with doctors as unfortunately my mix of adhd bpd and a sleep disorder make it hard to find meds that work ive worked really hard in therapy to communicate better and show him i see the positives and not just the negatives ive started texting him and being honest about when im upset or hurt and why so i dont make assumptions and hes not caught off guard i even made him a star jar where i wrote things i like about him or thank yous and folded them into stars for him to unfold and see that i do care and appreciate him all week except monday he wasnt home until late we dont celebrate valentines but he was out late supporting a friend the day before so i wanted to at least see him for a few hours to chat and maybe have a drink and do a puzzle together we love puzzles he ended up staying out late to support a different friend he did say he was wrong but i told him i dont want to play the blame game just that im sad and lonely and feel pathetic yesterday he was out all day and went to a friends house party at 5pm he said hed update me with what time he thinks hed be out until but by 10pm i was a mess and knew i had to go to bed or id self harm i texted him that im going to bed night he just said goodnight i ended up self harming anyway i broke down and texted him i dont want to be alone anymore all the time alone with myself and he just responded with this was a planned party he got home at 4am today he went off on me he said all week ive been passive aggressive and frustrating you know when your chest is so tight it hurts and your bpd grief is so all consuming your whole body feels broken i part laughed part sobbed and part wailed i kind of scared even myself id been doing my best all week to be understanding and open about how i feel and not even lay blame but when i lay there at 11pm too weak and dizzy to stay awake from sobbing he saw aggression i know its not healthy to live life revolving around a fp but im having trouble pulling myself out of the hole of hate every time i take a step out something trips and pushes me back in anyone have any advise or things that have worked for them when the hole keeps getting deeper and you cant rely on others for support,post-pandemic

it would take forever to explain everything so im going to try and keep it as short as possible ive been communicating with angels and now i think they lied to me or somehow i did something wrong and now the outcome isnt what was promised to me the way things happened it was how they told me it would and then everything shifted i keep going in and out of some sort of place its as if someone else is running my life most of the time recently and that spirit is making terrible choices everything is ruined i was in a relationship and now i wonder if i truly was the bad one they were telling me all these secrets about him and he wouldnt ever admit to any of it i hated him for this the hate kept growing and growing i turned my children against him its as if he became my trigger but now when i am looking back im not sure what i saw in him is real i think maybe i was seeing what i was told to see vs what was there anyways i took the four kids and ran i signed a lease a few towns over i dont even have a job i was a stay at home mom but i was promised abundance if i left i just needed to follow gods plan god told me to just sit and wait so i did and then one day the opportunity popped up and money landed in my lap in the most unexpected way ever i up and left one morning i get here and all of the things he was doing are still happening even when he isnt here the cameras are still popping up my things are still disappearing and reappearing and other things i cant seem to remember at this moment and then i talk to him and hes worried about me which is strange because i remember him not loving me he was mean to me he didnt want me he was cheating and hated me he was trying to kill me or make me kill myself he was a narcissist and he was gas lighting me i was his prisoner so i thought but looking back i was not nice i was lazy and mean and didnt allow him to speak i wouldnt talk to him or anything i have no real proof of these things i thought he was doing i tried to find the cameras but i never could i tore so many things apart and the cameras would be gone i took pictures of evidence of things and those would just disappear or be different now im sitting in this house and i cant seem to understand whats happening my tarot cards were talking to me and telling me everything the angels would send me signs and songs and feathers and like idk how to explain it i feel the angels and i had a great relationship but when i moved its as if they just went away and now the tarot readings are saying i am doomed i dont know how to explain whats happening in moments like this its like oh my god what have i done but then someone takes over and just keeps destroying everything i think ive terrified my children i told them he was going to kill me i was truly convinced he was trying to kill me he was poisoning me i start talking and i cant stop im screaming at myself in my head to just shut up but she just keeps going i havent really been able to sleep much yet i dont have a lot of memories its as if my memories are all blurry and time isnt really the same as it should be days are like only hours long i dont know how to explain what is happening i dont know what is real and what isnt the cops came and checked on me i think they wanted to take me away but i sent them away i cant go away i am the only one who can watch the children but honestly i dont think they should be around me right now i remember watching my mom do these things and i remember it being scary i keep begging for help i keep begging him for help but no one is showing up he said i can come home but i feel its a trap if i go back he will be worse than before what if this is his plan what if he is making me look crazy all around like hes making me think im crazy he came here and left a charger box by my bed bed that looked like a camera because he knew id panic i remember him yelling all the time but he calls me all day and he hasnt yelled at me once hes crying and begging me to come home he says hes worried i dont understand what is happening but i know none of this is right there is so much more but i cant remember im supposed to remember and i cant what have i done and how do i fix this how do i even know whats real and what isnt who do i trust i dont know who to go to right now i dont feel very safe at times everywhere i go someone is trying to hurt me but i recently remembered the cameras watched me before i met him others have poisoned me before all of the thjnfs hes doing to me its all happened before i met him except this time its been almost two years this has been happening after my grandfather died everything changed and he says he took me back home a year ago and it was a terrible experience all around and he says ever since then i completely shut down and i havent come back from it but my episodes dont last that long thats a long time i do know when i came back i was possessed by the devil that was a crazy experience but i got better but he says i never got better i got worse so is he using my fears and making me think im crazy or is this and has this been me the entire time i asked my older children and they told me he was mean and such but they couldnt really describe how other than i cried all the time i know i need to go to the doctor i do know this right now i know this but i may not know it in a little bit does that make sense im supposed to write things down but i dont think i have i thought he was a narcissist and he hated me and when i left now he is love bombing me and trying to trap me but at the same time he sounds so he doesnt even sound like the man i was living with before hes talking to me and staying on the phone with me all night he isnt out cheating hes on the phone with me all night all day he isnt telling me im crazy hes saying hes worried about me he isnt mad hes sad im freaking out i cant explain everything i just know this isnt right i feel i may have went into another dimension i was trying to get to new earth the angels were helping me get there but this feels like hell this is not what was promised what is happening how do i know if this is delusions ok i before i post i did read this and i see how it sounds im not sure how to change it to make it sound better but something is happening here and i need this to stop i need this to stop,post-pandemic

hey so idk if this is against the rules or whatever but i have a question about a weird thing that i have theres this thing that i have had since i was maybe 89 its where theres a character from a cartoon show dont wanna give specifics and i sorta sometimes asked myself what would i do in their shoes and its helped me a lot with social issues on my early childhood but they are like stuck in my head they wont leave not in a split personality kinda way i just sorta use their thoughts sometimes its beneign or rather ive learned to live with it as a kid i had a lot of issues fitting in but that was because i was a more nerdy kid in a small town and it was then that i developed this coping mechanism and idk for clarity my family does have multiple autistic people in it but ive been told that im not autistic so im wondering if this is a common autistic trait or if its something else that may need to be looked into sorry if this isnt within the rules tldr weird character in my brain autistic thing or not,post-pandemic

trigger warning this post discusses oding death is luckily not involved i am not an addict however i thought this could be a precautionary tale for others i had a group of friends i used to party with a while back and they threw a party the other night after i stopped partying with them their parties started to escalate by a lot parties of 1520 people turned into parties of well over 100 people where people started to line up the backyard block of the apartment complex this happened right in my backyard i expected to hear the party raging into 34 in the morning but around 1130pm i heard the music stop and people shouting to get out and leave i walked into my backyard and saw a guy 10 feet away who was passed out and not breathing ive never seen someone od before and was pretty freaked out the ambulance was 10 minutes out and no one knew anything about him people around him rolled him over on his side but non of the 100 people including me had narcan to give him there was an emt at the party but in the chaos of it all he froze and did not do anything the guy was lucky that the ambulance came when it did however he was not the only one that night there was another case in the same night where a different guy was experiencing od symptoms and his friends drove him to the hospital the leading theory is that someone at the party had been spiking drinks and even though a group of 34 people were there with him the other 100 stood around making disgusting jokes of the entire situation things like he shouldve died what a weak dude he ruined the whole party no one even knew his name i dont think the guys next to him even knew his name please be careful out there im picking up narcan tonight i just think about if this were my brother if this were my son or even just him a random guy i barely saw if he died i dont know how i would handle that if it were up to the people at this party to save him i dont think a single person could to further note for those currently struggling many colleges around the country offer narcan for free in the onsite school pharmacy it can save your life or someone elses life around you and its at no cost to you the instructions are really simple and its a nasal spray i always heard of this kind of thing happening but to see it in my own backyard was a new awakening this kind of situation escalates fast and most of the people around you may not be prepared for this emergency situation the guy probably never even saw my face and has no idea i value his life i just wish i had narcan to give him i wish there was more i could do for him even from a trusted source drugs can be tainted with anything its better to have something that can save you if the worst case scenario were to happen because it does happen,post-pandemic
i made the mistake of making a multireddit with all the medical subreddits including those where you can ask a dr about your symptoms or medical condition and get some medical input i thought the knowledge would be useful for healthdisease prevention purposes and it stands to reason it would but for me it was a big mistake scrolling through that freaked me out and im still recovering worrying that i might have 90 out of the 30 diseases i read about so i removed many subreddits from that health multireddit i made im still on some healthrelated subreddits that dont trigger me as much its a benefit to panic ratio i guess point being be very mindful of what subreddits you follow prune your subscriptions if you need to i feel like at this point it is better to live a shorter happier life than a stress and anxiety ridden longer life,post-pandemic
i remember getting accommodations for my college courses with my adhd and while talking with the people in the offices and in the forms i had to sign in order to get these accommodations the word disability constantly popped up personally this kind of hit me hard and i was kind of pissed off when they refer to adhd as a disability sure lifes a lot harder with adhd but comparing it on the same level to people with literal retardation down syndrome autism and whatever on the same level kind of made me mad,pre-pandemic
i go to a wondeful campus but my anxiety didnt want to leave my back ive tried to calm down and all but all i could think is if my smile is not crispy or why the organisators were looking at me so often one of the guide discuss with me when all the visit were done and i tried to made it cool just i joked about the price of a cake they offered and lets just say its not good idea to talk when you feel freewheeling i know it sound annoying but its not easy somtimes to dissociate your bad version to a decent one,post-pandemic

disclaimer this is something i wrote in response to someone who wants to pull funding from gifted programs around the world i wont be doing a tldr unless you ask me too and i am not rewriting this because im in a shitty mood thanks in part to my adderall practically curing my adhd and lifting that fog for the last few months which has allowed me to reflect on my entire life and with help dig deep and rediscover myself with profound revelations i now know how fucked i was this treatment and therapy has been so breathtakingly amazing i cant believe i spent 10 years without treatment i just wish i had done so earlier and been supported by good people during that time as well here goes start i hate people like you i went through school thinking i was the idiot my iq is over 180 and is probably immeasurable but i felt stupid because everyone i have ever met outside of europe especially in the united states always says something similar children would benefit from learning how to be respectful and how to be humble something as a whole they seem to be lacking my parents my family my classmates society in general etc i wish i had stayed in europe they bent over backwards to accommodate my specific needs and because of such early help might be the only reason im able to overcome all the trauma you average idiots did to me i dont know what the logic behind that asinine thinking is i dont know whether truly gifted kids make average people feel like idiots and because theyre just smart enough to be selfaware they get offended like a bunch of downs kids with iqs 50 trying to figure out a problem and an average person comes by and without even thinking about it just does it in front of them now shift that so the downs kids are average and you might be able to conceptualize just how goddamn smart these kids are is that scary because it makes you look stupid ill put it in another way i am so intelligent i have broken all testing to the point i cant be tested they dont work which by the way psychological testing breaks at 130149 that youd have to adjust the downs kids to 130149 and make the same shift towards more intelligent to find me it might also be worth noting by shaming people for being smart you are limiting the abilities and forcing highiq individuals to conform to your society your way of life your ideas of whats right and wrong when these kids are so far in advance of anything you can think of there is no conceivable way you could understand yes these kids have sometimes severe idiosyncrasies its a part of being extremely intelligent but despite your limited comprehension they do not care for the same things you do and are most likely the least racist least judgmental naturally humble friendly emotionally stable people that exist ive only recently been getting the help to untangle the web of average lies and bs meant to keep me in line and am beyond furious at how i was treated you cant put gifted kids in public school if you do you are putting the best of our society in a system that is completely incapable of teaching or handling them in a sense we are like retards and they get their own funding because you cant have retards in normal curriculums and considering that gifted individuals are just as far from average as the retards are from average doesnt it make sense that normal curriculum is unsuitable for them as well and limiting throw in the great unwashed large class numbers these kids gifts get drowned out and they spend a lifetime dealing with the aftermath i hope you have a gifted child so you can watch him grow up in public school so you can watch as your sons talent and intelligence is nuked in your public schools and watch as they grow up and realized how you fucked them because that kid will most likely disown you and the irony is that youll never understand why end if you have any question feel free to pm me or just comment thanks for listening,pre-pandemic

after my defining and horrific psychotic episode in 2012 my life became an antimania mission no alcohol no drugs no caffeine stay at a healthy weight get and keep a job with good healthcare go to therapy once a week see my psychiatrist every 13 months never ever stop taking meds be careful about adjusting them keep my support system close keep a routine and sleep always always 9 hours of sleep ignore the depression push the depression aside push through the depression i checked myself into the hospital 3 times for depression over the past seven years i decided in 2016 to fight back celexa then cymbalta then lamitcal and now seroquel loved the lamictal and i cant say enough good things about it unfortunately my body had a very rare reaction to it this year that caused my liver kidneys and thyroid to respond negatively but i can say going into 2020 that i have hope i hope that the seroquel will bring a spark of joy back into my life ill take whatever time it will give me,pre-pandemic
here is what you need to know headaches are rarely a sign of anything serious if you got up this morning without having any of the following you are completely fine a seizure vomiting having pain that feels like an axe was embedded inside your head dizziness trouble walking forgetting your name or having trouble reading something up close do also note that these things can be caused by many other causes as well cancer in young people is extremely rare and so are neurological problems the reason why is because your immune system is much stronger when youre younger young people who have cancer are almost always going to live longer than five years dying due to cancer is almost unheard of under the age of 50 cancers and other major problems are always noticeable and grow rapidly in young people ct and mri scans are almost always useless if you are healthy many of the symptoms of brain cancer are not caused by any underlying problems these symptoms include temporary loss of balance twitching muscle jerks brain fog messing upmisspelling a word forgetting something and headaches trust me these symptoms are more common than you think so in conclusion brain cancers and every other cancer should be the least of your worries especially if you are young and healthy i am not reassuring that you dont have it i am however showing you that worrying about something that almost never happens is a waste of time anxiety can waste minutes hours days months or even years of your life now i know this probably isnt going to stop you from worrying about your symptoms but the more you try to seek out reassurance from both reddit and the internet the more youre going to panic what you need to do is find a way to break your vicious ha circle and break it now before it gets worse,pre-pandemic

i struggle with social anxiety not knowing what to say sometimes missing hintsmost of all flirting ive become good friends with a female coworker since early december we talk often mostly personal subjects theres always joking smiling and laughing i now know i like her id assume this was all friendly if it werent for differences in how she is around me vs others i upped my playfulness whenever we chat and she plays along other times shes sort of anxious she has anxiety too though ive noticed more little signs like blushing glances looking downlaughing when we talk she often comes over to me to talk we had a funny encounter a few nights ago after work first time meeting outside it i was waiting near a corner of a nearby restaurant unexpectedly she bumped into me while going towards a shop and got jump scaredi was panicking due to liking her when she saw it was me she immediately broke into laughter with me not at me she jokingly asked if i was i waiting to ambush her then exclaimed im telling evvvveryone with a huge grin my face was probably so red i quickly played back please dont ill actually quit etc which made her laugh more but it was in good fun then we talked more and said goodnight would it be acceptable to ask her if shed want to talk in private at the end of the day to ask her out i dont want to ask her anything like that around other people out of respect for her our friendship i believe is sturdy enough that it wouldnt be impacted by it not working out it would definitely end up being something we laugh about,post-pandemic

ive been catching myself doing this a lot lately and its somewhat hard to explain but i feel this group will understand basically for most of what i do i explain it in my head as if someone is gonna question me example if im at the gym and im doing a certain exercise ill already run a scenario in my head where someone is asking me why im doing what im doing another example i keep a notebook with me to write down things i need to remember and whatnot clutch i regularly run a scenario where someone asks me why im writing in a notebook it comes down to conversations in my head that will never happen and forcing myself to defend myself in fantasy situations its exhausting shut up brain,pre-pandemic
i honestly dont mind one single bit for many people this sub is the only place they have to turn to for anything ed related its the only support or community they have for help and questions and yes we can argue people should look for posts before they post their own post to avoid repetitive posts but honestly i dont mind at all often we are not in the right frame of mind to look through posts we are freaking out and need quick reassurance an answer or to vent right now if people are restricting sometimes the concentration needed to read through prior posts just isnt there let people freak out about weight gain even if we all know its water weight let people ask if others fee invalid most of us just want quick connection and validation just somewhere where we can give a voice to the ed part of us that needs help so i just love every post and every post is valid except trolls of course in my opinion ask away rant away post away ps sorry for the clickbait title lmao,pre-pandemic

so my bf recently moved in with me and my dad and at first i was scared they wouldnt get along well when i saw it was actually going well i was really happy as ive told my bf my relationship with my dad wasnt always the greatest long story short among other things when i was younger he would sometimes hit me and i didnt really feel safe at home then he would apologize and cry to me so i would tell him its okay and ofc he would do it again it wasnt that bad but it piled up with lots of other little things all of which i have told my bf about despite my bf knowing about this and telling me he doesnt like my dad because of this they spend a lot of time together my dad introduced my bf to rock climbing and now they go multiple times a week together leaving me alone at home again im happy they get along well but im also fighting my jealousy internally im jealous of how my dad treats him when were the 3 of us together its as if i dont even exist my dad only talks to my bf im also upset at my bf for spending so much time with him i know its stupid and i hate that it makes me so upset and envious i keep thinking that i would never spend so much time with anyone who ever wronged him that he would hate it if the roles were reversed and then i feel guilty and pathetic for thinking that way my dad has been talking about going to ski the 3 of us for a while and i was excited to go now im at work and i just learned they went without me i feel so upset i can physically feel it i dont know what to do with my feelings who to tell or even what to tell im just so tired of not being able to tell what is real and what is a disproportionate reaction im scared ill lash out but i really dont want to hurtlose my bf,post-pandemic
cw for medical trauma my first bout of health anxiety occurred after a traumatic event it wasnt medical necessarily but thats just where my brain ran with i guess after some time i grew out of it then when my daughter was younger she suffered an undiagnosed acute medical incident she made a full recovery i myself also began to have some chronic issues by this point albeit fairly common ones which ive all but completely gotten a handle on now after years of meds and lifestyle stuff i still struggle with health anxiety that i know is very illogical i have personally never met anyone with health anxiety who doesnt have at least some medical trauma i have also personally seen people who previously had zero health anxiety develop it following a medically traumatic event im wondering what yall think would it make more sense to refer to a lot of health anxiety as medical trauma theres such a stigma surrounding health anxietyie just hypochondriabut perhaps identifying trauma as the root cause of this neurosis will alleviate that what are your thoughts,post-pandemic
my therapist for social anxiety treatment has asked me to practice by dividing a feeling into 5 parts and acting out each part in front of a mirror for example if i want to act out the feeling of anger i should divide it into 5 parts with the level of anger increasing from low to high in each part however i feel like i dont know how to express emotions with parts of my body other than my face for example what state do my hands and feet take on when im angry does anyone have any suggestions for better performing this exercise,post-pandemic

so im 17 and i smoked weed for the first time oct 20 2023 since then ive been smoking a few times a week except for most of december i went without however lately or rather since my last sesh with the boys i have had crippling anxiety which i already had paranoia which i already had feelings of popping back into reality feeling as though i am robotic and having trouble with sitting in a class room and existential thoughts and just thinking things like damn how is any of this real am i really me now i dont know if its just that the anxiety got worse or if ive genuinely fucked up my brain because i get severe crippling anxiety attacks but nothing ever like this the depersonalization is so strong and i guess ive noticed a change in my emotions as well like i dont feel as much as i used to or dont care as much and kind of only focus on whatevers going on in my mind and i dont wanna jump to conclusions but from what ive heard my mom has schizophrenia and this is something i cant verify as i have no contact with her and likely never will also the feeling of being generally disorientedmanual thinking of basic tasks that i know how to do quite proficiently is this just some weird bout with anxiety or have i fucked up big this time,post-pandemic
so today i 19m wanted to head down to this giant eagle close to my college campus to pick up a visa gift card i gathered 55 dollars and made my way to the car i debated whether i should go but was like fuck it im gonna at least drive done there i have a bit of driving anxiety too so i made it in the parking lot and i think hm ill glad i drove done there but maybe ill just drive back to campus then i was just like fuck it and went inside i searched for my gift card which took a little bit of searching but i finally got it and went to a cashier i didnt want to do the self checkout because im illiterate with that kind of technology and didnt have my debit card on me but i finally got up to the cashier and paid she said it was 5595 and i said ok and starting putting my cash in only to realize i didnt have enough lmao so i told her she didnt seem too thrilled but i guess also not mad she just had to abort the transaction and i got my money back i thought about maybe gathering more money and going back but turned down the idea ill probably do that tomorrow so although i didnt get the visa gift card im proud of myself for pushing myself to go up there again i have a bit of driving anxiety too and had to drive in a busy parking lot feels amazing to have a little success like this i think ill keep trying this to push myself out of my comfort zone until i feel very little to no anxiety,post-pandemic

tw suicide i dont know why im still hung up on this but i attempted suicide in december nothing really happened after i talked about it with my partner to an extent said i almost attempted because i wasnt sure how to categorize it still have not clarified 10 days later i talked about it in therapy in general it feels like it didnt happen it wasnt real and it didnt matter attempting suicide felt inconsequential and i think its probably because ive treated it that way i thought about going to the hospital or a php after but that seemed scary and stupid so instead i went back to full time work i didnt care about the risk of attempting again because it didnt matter to me and its like i understand why i did that but i cant believe i actually did that the first time i attempted it was this whole dramatic thing when i was hospitalized my mom chastised me for attempting in public and cried that she would throw herself into my grave if i died my ex berated me staff and everyone else asked the same questions over and over why why why why why why so awful why dont you see what you have arent you happy it was fucking awful and made me never want to go to the hospital again this time it felt completely different there was a small burst of oh my god from a couple of people i know and trust then it faded away and i just went back to work then the world moved on as it does its not like im hoping for any specific reaction from anyone the contrast is just strange to experience and i still cant tell whether or not i made the right call i think i did but my inability to seek or accept help when im in a crisis feels depressing and scary i truly feel that my life doesnt matter and that if i reach out people will only harm me idk,post-pandemic

to give some context the event happened on may 20 2018 we had just moved into a nice apartment after living in extended stays for the past couple of years i got my own bedroom and the complex had a small pool i could swim at during the summer which was really exciting for me since i was so used to sleeping on air mattresses it was around 1000am my mom went to pick up a dog that my dad was supposedly going to give me as a gift me and my stepdad expected the trade would take only a few minutes as they were meeting at a gas station across the street from the complex building an hour later she didnt show up my stepdad tried to call her over and over again but she wouldnt pick up i didnt worry that much as i thought that the trade was taking longer than expected a little later we hear a knock on our door it was the police who told us that my dad shot my mom than shot himself everyone was in absolute shock when they heard the news they were crying and screaming with grief while i just stood there trying to comfort anyone i could it didnt set in with me that this was actually happening a lot happened during that year im leaving out a lot of details but i ended up being put in a mental ward for a week after threatening to commit suicide after the event i bottled up so much emotions that it got to the point where i just snapped in that instance i wanted to kill myself i wanted to kill other people i wanted everything to just stop existing for as long as i wanted it to needless to say i didnt feel so good for the next few months i still struggle with the grief but i try to manage it as best i can its the middle of the night as im writing this it keeps on playing in the back of my mind so i cant fall asleep i felt like i needed to get this out there so i would stop destroying myself over something that wasnt my fault i was 14 when it happened im 15 now i cant see myself the way my peers do anymore i feel like my childhood was taken away from me tldr the murder suicide fucked me up big time and im trying to get over it the best i can sorry for the long post i just felt like i needed to get this out there,pre-pandemic

im not sure what to do about this but its taking over my life im unable to go my normal day without watching the movie hes from or reading the comics or doing something related to him its so hard and hes all i want to talk about i find it hard making friends and keeping them and its so much harder when my special interest isnt an interest of everyone around me or they just dont want to hear it because they dont care as much as i do ive never been helped with coping with my autism and its making everything so much harder when i cant get my special interest out of my mind and people dont care as much as i do and its making it harder to interact with people even my own parents ive always been this way and its got to the point where i cant take it anymore because i feel so unable to be normal if anyone has any advice or something thats worked for them i would appreciate it,post-pandemic
i just wanted to take a moment to remind you how amazing the human body is lets think about our ancestors lets think about the harsh conditions weather starvation injury lack of medicine lack of clean water that the cavemen endured lets think about these same harsh conditions that millions of humans still endure today in undeveloped nations lets think about the incredible survival stories weve all heard someone surviving in the wilderness for years someone surviving a horrible animal attack or car accident or plane crash someone overcoming a terminal illness when we sit around in our clean tidy organized firstworld countries its easy to forget what generations upon generations of humans have gone through to get us to this point the human body has adapted and evolved to be able to survive some of the harshest conditions on this planet extreme heat extreme cold starvation dehydration infection broken bones open wounds it is an incredibly intelligent machine with hundreds of builtin mechanisms to coursecorrect if something is thrown offbalance and most of us have such advantages today as access to clean water consistent food and medical care which havent been readily available for the majority of human existence so no that paper cut isnt going to give you sepsis that drop of blood on the toilet paper isnt going to be your end that headache isnt a tumor or a stroke or an aneurysm a bout of food poisoning isnt going to kill you breathing in some smoke or fumes isnt going to cause permanent damage a fast heart rate isnt a heart attack that acid reflux isnt esophageal cancer it starts to sound silly the more you think about it next time you are worried about a symptom remember just how strong you really are remember how much the human body can survive remember that you are equipped with the same incredible biological machinery as generations before you who endured far worse than you ever will,pre-pandemic

sorry if its a dumb or insensitive question so if you know you have health anxiety doesnt that fact mean you know youre probably actually physically fine and on the flip side if youre having real chronic symptoms why would you presume you have ha physical symptoms cause legitimate anxiety and i think people sometimes flip that around ive never seen a good enough evidence that anxiety can cause chronic symptoms while it is obvious to me it can cause acute symptoms for me ive developed several neurological symptoms this last year and tried to cling to the anxiety explanation however i dont find it really holds water and as time goes by its getting more obvious to me that im developing some kind of neuropathy probably sfn fibromyalgia so what do you think how do you know if youre an anxious person thinking hes sick or a sick person getting legitimately anxious,post-pandemic

i learnt something tragic yesterday one of my female acquaintances recently lost her older sister to suicide yesterday she was talking about it and it turns out her sister was incredibly lonely the part that really hit me was when my acquaintance said she just wanted to be loved she had a lot of friends and was wellliked by everybody that knew her but romanticallyemotionally she was lonely this is why it also makes me angry when people say relationships are not as great as you think it is abundantly clear that people need deep meaningful connections with other humans if youve never been lonely for a long period of time you have no idea how that hurts you how it breaks you down how it leaves a gaping hole stay strong my fellow lonely hearts i hope each one of you find that something that person that connection you are looking for,pre-pandemic
to all i am one of you i know what youre going through this past month has been tough for me i was convinced that i had at least 34 different types of cancers and just bounced around from one to the other depending on the type of symptoms i was feeling at the time the dermotologist finding a suspicious growth on my skin didnt exactly help either that is what kicked everything off this has been the worst episode of prolonged ha of my life and has led me to be prescribed an ssri which i may or may not continue taking hasnt kicked in yet today i had a regular annual physical with my doctor i went in nervous and left feeling the most relief that i have felt in the past month what changed instead of focusing on what i think may be wrong my family history of diseases screening options the types of labs i wanted i instead fessed up and told her that my biggest issue is health anxiety we ended up talking about health anxiety for 90 of my physical what i understood from our talk is that we do not give doctors enough credit they know what theyre talking about they can tell things about your health just by looking at you and asking a few questions i went through a list of things i read on google with my doctor and she debunked it all confidently she explained the reasons why certain things i read do not apply to me and why other things are complete heresay misinformation or represents a statistically irrelevant number of cases in the end i actually ran out of concerns to point out she had fielded them all and i had nothing left even trying to grasp at what if in the future were shut down by the simple reply of you are a healthy young man with nothing to fear sometimes that is just what we need to be told i know its intimidating but i urge anyone that has not visited their doctor in some time due to fear to schedule that appointment you dont need to do any tests just have a talk explain your fears and listen to logic it ended up being the exact thing i needed to hear,post-pandemic
this might be a mess sorry in advance about a month ago when arguing with my sister about non related issues me struggling to take care of myself she told me she didnt believe my schizophrenia is real it is specifically the schizophrenia i also have depression anxiety and adhd the first two sort of obviously related to the schizophrenia anyway her explanation was that my hallucination experiences i had shared with her previously tactile auditory visual were just me not connecting to my body and i needed to learn about how my brain works and is connected to my body as if the feelings are similar to chills or something i admit i might not have been able to fully explain my experience which could be why she has such a subdued view of it i have told her a small amount of what i have experienced because shes asked but i get very uncomfortable describing hallucinations and delusions to her she has called me crazy before i was diagnosed while asking her for help and has tried to be my doctor basically by telling me i need to change my meds or saying my psychiatrist is doing their job wrong during the argument she also tried asking me what exactly is wrong with my brain as if i could tell her the exact chemical imbalances in my brain causing it when i was already flustered and crying like it was a big gotcha moment when i couldnt do it shes also said the timeline doesnt make sense because i was about 17 when it started and i am now in my early 20s with the diagnosis and females typically do not start showing symptoms until later in life i guess the experience really made me doubt myself but i have gotten to talk to some people since then that have been able to validate me i just feel incredibly hurt and seriously do not see myself forgiving her ever as drastic as that may sound she was the sole reason i started seeing a psychiatrist in the first place she used to tell me she could tell i was in some kind of psychosis and that i needed to get help and get on medication i even told her i was afraid of getting a diagnosis as silly as that may sound i felt like it was a forever stamp showing im crazy and like it would shatter my reality and afraid of getting on antipsychotics as i knew they could make me very tired or gain weight i feel like now that i have a diagnosis im on meds with the side effects i literally told her i was scared of and am actually doing better she disapproves and is partially doing this because of it the other part i do know is that she has been having a mental health crisis herself and i know shes in psychosis too refusing to get actual help and it is probably clouding her judgment of this despite her problems i hate her now she has done so many things in my life that should have been the end of our relationship and im such a nave forgiving person i continued to love her and trust her its been a month and i still cant believe shes said that stuff she knows how much the mental illness has completely fucked me up she was there for a lot of the lows and she still just says that stuff to me its so unforgivable and i have been avoiding her as much as i can even though i am living with her if any of you have similar experiences or have thoughts i would really appreciate them tldr sister is an asshole idk what to do,post-pandemic

i understand that the title may seem confusing but i seriously have been so upset by the whole situation and this is the best way to word it both my boyfriend and i have autism but it is much more visible on me due to a lot of behaviours i exhibit ive been noticing that whenever i stim my boyfriend starts ignoring me for the rest of the day or sometimes asking what the hell i am doing then calling it dumb or embarrassing he has acted the same way whenever ive had meltdowns or gone nonverbal i have no idea why he is acting like this because as far as im concerned he is well educated on autism and knows about a lot of the behaviours displayed by autistic people as he has it himself ive seriously been so confused and have no idea how to act because whenever i voice my opinions he shuts me down,post-pandemic
i know this sounds so like something so basic but lately my anxiety has been really bad preventing me from doing things i had to ship an item that someone bought off me online and i kept putting it off this week because i was too anxious to go to the post office and wasnt sure what i would do once i got there my boyfriend told me that i should try to go because this was something i needed to do since i already got paid for the item sometimes all you need is some support from one person to tell you that youll be fine about a certain situation once i got back i felt so relieved it was something so easy to do and i was just overthinking it and making myself more anxious but in reality there was nothing to be anxious about i just personally felt proud of myself and wanted to write this in case anyone has been dealing with similar anxiety we always tend to make out situations to be worse than they actually are and you wont know the outcome and that most of the time your anxiety is wrong unless you try,pre-pandemic

hello everyone over the past 12 years my girlfriends brother has slowly slipped into psychosis it started as paranoia he was being watchedfollowed but over the past couple months these feelings have drastically intensified to an obsession with his paranoid thoughts about half a year ago he attempted to take his own life and was admitted to an inpatient psych unit where he was prescribed a pretty strong antipsychotic this seem to help for a little bit but as of now his symptoms are worse than ever he messages my girlfriend basically 247 texting her all of his delusions many of which are quite frightening initially my girlfriend would just respond with compassion let him know were here for him empathize with how scary his thoughts are and never challenge his beliefs however it has become impossible for her to keep up with the shear volume of texting as he can text her for hours on end without stopping for what its worth his thoughts consist of being followed phone being hacked thinking his close family including my gf planted recording devices in the walls of his room and he consistently asked my girlfriend to just tell me where the cameras are he thinks his coworkers are messing with him he thinks the government is going to jail him for being a pedophile hes not he thinks hes seen pictures of his butt photo shopped onto other people online he often talks to himself through texting my girlfriend he believes that the hospital workers from when he hospitalized are conspiring against him and believes they are planning on harming my girlfriend and much much more scary thoughts recently with things as bad as they are my girlfriend and her father attempted to get him to self admit to inpatient psychological care and he responded very poorly as you could imagine he claims he is not suicidal but often sends ominous texts that are just vague enough to make my girlfriend very anxious he is consistently buying xanax and adderall off of the street as well to self medicate we frankly have no idea what to do were very worried for his safety and want him to get better but were not sure he will without medical intervention that he is refusing vehemently if anyone could offer any type of advice as to what to do if would be beyond appreciated tldr gfs brother is experiencing paranoid delusions and is refusing any type of help,post-pandemic

no i dont want to get better in fact i want to get worse i want to get so bad that i have no choice but to kill myself why would i want to get better if i want to die getting better will only slightly decrease my depression to the point where i still feel like shit but not enough to want to die and im sorry but thats the opposite of what i want i dont want to dish out a ridiculous amount of money for someone to convince me that i should keep living this ridiculously expensive and worthless life for another few decades death is the only way to free myself from all the problems in my life medication and therapy might minimize it but itll never truly go away the longer im alive the more problems will pop up and ending it right now is the only reasonable thing for me to do,pre-pandemic

cws for mentions of binging purging some specific numbers lbs cals overall gross stuff lol hi yall im a 19f whose dealt with disordered eating and some pretty bad body image issues since i was a preteen my food issues have reached a peak in the past couple months and i just kinda want to vent and sort out what ive been through ive been chubby since i was a kid and ive always dealt with some weird habits surrounding food i had and honestly still have pretty bad pica and i also had an era where i would rip out and eat my own hair when i was 1112 i got incredibly depressed when i was 1315 and i started to skip meals at school and purge meals at home this really culminated in the summer before my freshman year of high school when i quit playing softball and refused to leave the house for over an entire month i would eat very little have a large dinner and usually end up throwing it up into a trash can in my room i was somehow able to move away from these habits for the majority of high school but my self esteem took a big hit once i got to college in the fall of 2022 i was unpopular in high school and had never dated or been hit on by anyone im a lesbian but the lack of male attention really alienated me from all my straightbi friends none of this really changed in college through i began to understand that i needed to develop a healthier selfimage and actually put myself out there or i was never gonna get a gf or have sex while i focused on improving myself academically and socially during my first year i took a trip abroad during the summer of 2023 and was really caught off guard by how awful it made me feel i would take fit checks with my best friend but refuse to watch them because i felt i looked like a whale in comparison to her one of her hometown friends complimented me on instagram after she posted one of them on her story and it made me cry for hours in our hotel room because of how insincere it felt looking at photos of myself from the trip also made me super depressed because i felt like i was able to see my body how it actually was for the first time in a long while i decided i wanted to start losing weight that summer and i lost 35 lbs in 6 months through healthy restriction 16001400 cals about 1 lb a week for me i was spending a lot of fucking time thinking about food and my body but i was genuinely really happy with the progress i was seeing i went from a bmi of 31 to 25 and it made me feel genuinely proud and content for a while my issues really started ramping up november of last year because it took me a couple extra days to meet my monthly weight loss goal i lowered my intake to 1200 and then 1000 in preparation for the holidays i cancelled some social events and felt like shit for days on end for going over my cal limits a couple times i didnt have school or friends to distract me over break so i spent most of my time planning how i was going to lose weight and get fit for the new year i lowered my cal limit to 800 cals for the new year through ive been doing 600 calsday for the past month this has completely destroyed any sense of control i thought i had i eat 200400 cals some days and feel absolutely euphoric but anytime i go out with friends i eat so much i feel ashamed for days on end sometimes the meals are just normal portions but ive eaten 2000 cals in one meal a handful of times as well ive tried to fast the days after these binges which has mostly just led to me eating hundreds of cals right before bed and ive also tried out chewspitting and taking laxatives the day before my big weekly weighins ive also started to purge again its not everyday but its happened most days this past week and i am scared out of my mind ive done it in the bathroom i share with my roommate the ones at work and the communal ones at my school library my roomie had a boy over last night and i was so scared of them hearing me purge i brought a garbage bag into my room and did it there it reminded me so vividly of that depressive episode back when i was 15 and i literally did not have the energy to stay awake after making that connection i cannot stand the idea of having to smell rotting puke in my room ever again tonight was the worst episode i think ive ever had i went over to a new friends house for a party and ended up eating 23x the amount of the other people embarrassing but also purged two fucking times in their bathroom and another when i got back home i felt on edge and like i was acting super weird but i was also so disconnected from the experience that i couldnt stop being a bit crazy valentines has not made shit any better because i made my friends tons of baked goods im broke and have been eating basically just leftover cake and cookies and brownies for 5 days straight at this point because i cant hold myself back im tired of this and i hate that im not able to maintain the control i had throughout most of last year i feel weakwilled and like im acting fatter than ever before and i hate that im no longer able to trust myself to stick to a deficit and lose weight in the long run purging is also fucking horrible for you so are laxatives even csing ofc and i keep trying to keep myself from binging by reminding myself that purging could kill me in 5 million different ways but it just doesnt work im so disconnected from my body and all i fucking want is to be skinny for the first time in my life im also so embarrassed that i refuse to reach out to anyone but i cant stop the urge to tell anyone and everyone about what im going through nearly everyday i also feel a bit weird for considering talking to a counselor because my least favorite topic in the world is my body and appearance and i almost feel like it would make me feel worse on one hand i want to try and deal with this before it goes totally south but on the other i just want to be at my gw as quickly as possible so i can just live life a bit more normally and not have every thought i have revolve around what im going to eat and what im going to purge and all this bullshit ive also developed a very bitter jealousy for both my skinny and fatter friends because they all seem to have so much more freedom then i ever will its also a bit discouraging readinglurking in disordered communities because i inevitably feel like im nowhere near as ill or valid as other people so i should rly just shut up and suffer in silence lol finally although a lot of my desire to be thin is fueled by my selfimage and control issues i also just cant imagine being back in the body that i spent the most miserable years of my life in i want to change and become a better happier person but i feel like theres no way to get there unless i follow through with this love u all ty for reading 33 i am so mentally stable its insane,post-pandemic

ive been with my wife for 13 years since high school shes the absolute love of my life and weve been having a lot of issues my wifes mom was diagnosed with alzheimers around 56 years ago and 2 years ago the condition worsened to the point we had to take her mom back to her home country for round the clock nursing care my wifes parents had some weird arrangement that i cant explain but essentially the dad stayed in the home country while the mom and my wifesiblings came to the usa and they have been living separately for 20 years however her parents never got a divorce turns out her mom had an affairfor almost the entire duration of her time in the us and when she left the country this person signed her house to himself and emptied her retirement accounts to himself we have been in litigation for over a year now this and everything else we both have been dealing with gave my wife a lot of anxiety last october she decided to see a psychiatrist and let me know that she was going to start taking zoloft i myself have been diagnosed with major depressive order for years and have been on wellbutrin i know ssris have helped a lot of people but the horror stories of negative side effects was something i was always aware of however since im not a medical professional and this was about her health and wellbeing i didnt raise any objections because i wanted to be supportive a month after she started zoloft she told me she thought it was working after her dose was increased from 2550mg and thats when we started having a lot of issues in retrospect i fucked up not connecting the dots sooner what i felt at the time was that my wife progressively pulled away from me seemed to not really care about me all that much anymore wasnt doing the same thingsreciprocating affection like the woman ive loved for 13 years things got really really bad and we almost got a divorce it was after the climax that it finally popped into my head wait could this be a side effect of her zoloft i googled zoloft almost destroyed my marriage and was floored by the reddit posts and other stories i found online most of them had a lot in common with my situationhow i felt skipping forward a bit she stopped taking zoloft roughly 45 weeks ago shes said that shes been feeling better at first she didnt even realize anything was off but because of how close we got to divorce and the videos on youtube from psychiatrists talking about the extreme emotional blunting they themselves went through she agreed to give stopping it a try she later told me she realized that she did in fact have severe emotional blunting because when she thought about having to give up our dog who is like a son to her she realized that she was completely indifferent to the thought my wife told me over dinner last weekend that she feels like the zoloft has permanently changed her feelings for me shes also been listening to christmas music and other happy music almost nonstop since then every free moment she has where she working or on a conference call she is listening to the same 45 songs shes clocked hundreds of hours of play time in the last month alone this strikes me as a completely new behavior and my hypothesis is that she still in some ways feels dead inside and that those songs in particular are some of the few things that gives her an emotional response my question iswhen are these side effects going to wear off or is it potentially permanent in some ways i love my wife and i wouldnt leave her side even if she herself got alzheimers one day and didnt know who i was but its been very very difficult for me i feel like my wife has been gone for a long time can anyone provide any information advice anything that would be helpful in this situation,post-pandemic

so my flashbacks tend to be very hard to come back to reality from sometimes im stuck in that moment and no matter how many times i say im not there im in the present 5 senses all that i still can feel stuck there one thing i started to do is like focus on something other than the event but its still in that flashback time so for example my flashbacks are related to a sexual assault rather than focusing on the action itself i try to remember what the stairs looked like we were in a basement when it happened so i try to picture the stairs and then maybe the walls another time i tried to remember what was on the tv or make up something to be on the tv so maybe youre stuck in the moment but its a little more bearable if youre not stuck on the action itself,pre-pandemic
12 years ago yesterday i called 911 thinking i was going to die from drinking 35 days in a row the fire engines showed up and asked me what was going on i told them i was an alcoholic and that i couldnt seem to quit drinking my brother lives in the same town and i texted him saying i was headed to the er he came over and picked me up instead of the ambulance people taking me saved some money there they detoxed me for about 7 hours and with ivs in my arms and sensors on my chest i was scratching my head on how i ended up in the er it was from 1 beer i drank on dec 19th 2007 i then made a decision after staring at a gray wall for a few hours that i was an alcoholic and couldnt drink anymore i left there about 7pm that night on jan22 2008 and went home not knowing how i would live this new life of sobriety this was my bottom as i had struggled from 20052008 with the alcohol consumption sky rocketing losing jobs and near death experiences i had had enough i started drinking when i was 14 i was 43 in 2008,pre-pandemic

the day went by and i completely forgot it was almost a non event despite being a big deal monday february 12th i officially went one whole year without meth no cravings no slips no crises it was the day i went into the hospital to make my way to the psych ward and ultimately to my final stay at rehab i was self medicating my adhd with meth for a few months at that point and before that it was two years of molly and crack my mental health dipped in that last three months as my usage skyrocketed and i switched to occasional iv use as someone with adhd i had never experienced a high with meth it was strictly a way to feel normal but it degrades your mental health and my methed up mind kept trying to push the envelope and try to cure myself of adhd finally on february 11th i started a 12 hour binge of an 18th of meth never got high but i did hit psychosis i left my parents house and was picked up laying in someones front yard a few neighborhoods over hallucinating nightmare monsters my mom fought for them to take me in to the psych ward and im glad she did i was scared but that last run in rehab was so calming and full of light and hope after rehab i stayed in a sober living shortly who kicked me out because they didnt like that my adhd had symptoms but while i was there someone i met opened my mind to the fact that i should pursue an autism diagnosis it changed my whole recovery plan from that moment forward my therapy medication management and interactions with state services propelled me forward i smoked weed moderately for a little while during the year and twice i had panic attacks and smoked a little bit of coke but i never touched meth again and for the last three months ive been completely drug free now my doctor is prescribing vyvanse because its more important that my adhd is under control because thats what started this whole issue in a little over a week i start my career again and in a month ill be picking up second work in the neurodivergence space im very happy with where i am now recovery is possible and it doesnt have to include 12step if i had blindly followed 12step id probably be dead now i would have never found the underlying issue causing my addiction advocate for yourself and never stop discovering new things about yourself im hoping to go to school for my masters in addiction counseling with focuses in harm reduction and neurodivergence i want to help people my program involves surrounding myself with other neurodivergent people first and foremost its what keeps me regulated i love my life if youre struggling right now just know you can love your life one day it not only possible but will happen if you work for it thanks for reading,post-pandemic

im just really frustrated at this point im a considerably awkward person i usually avoid social contact and dont enjoy it that much but whenever i find myself in a social situation in which i am somewhat comfortable i can get rather obnoxious due to my general awkwardness and total lack of braintomouth filter and any sort of idea on how to actually behave myself in a conversation ive found that this issue is exacerbated whenever im talking with someone my age never really had any friends as i grew up except for a few exceptions nowadays i only ever hang out with a few people older than me im 22 and most of my socializing is done online which doesnt work very well ive gone through a lot of friend groups over the years and it always ended up the same way most people ended up finding me too awkward or obnoxious and kicked me out of the group the idea would generally be well just find people like you but the thing is that ive tried and never really found anyone lately ive been part of a small active community of people from a stream we generally vc every day but the most common outcome is that most of them just bully the shit out of me for any given reason because i listen to metal because i try too hard when playing a game because i dont try hard enough because ive got a weird voice because i talk a lot because i like certain streamer or because im an acquaintance of a certain person however ive got a few friends whom i play games with sometimes all of them in their late 30s and they generally dont mind my behavior theyre really chill and ive found that when playing with people older than me this pattern tends to repeat itself at this point i honestly have no idea of what to do most people just seemingly cant stand me and get aggressive towards me often even though i rarely ever do anything to anger them on purpose ive been wishing that i had some small friend group to play games with an all for years but each time i found any it ended up with people finding me too obnoxious and the people who were cool with me were generally in na or europe so it was impossible to play games with them due to latency anyone has any tips on how to deal with this because im tired,post-pandemic
im here asking for help on how to deal with health anxiety in my dreams i have always been a vivid dreamer and have always been able to remember my dreams after waking up in the past ive had dreams that involve usually myself being diagnosed or experiencing symptoms of something related to my health anxiety fixations but last night i had my first dream about a close family member finding out they have a notsogood diagnosis and it caused me a fair amount of distress im afraid my dreams will be some kind of premonition and that if i dont act on them to try and prevent the negative outcome i will have missed an opportunity to save my family member i have been ruminating on it all day has anyone else experienced this and if so how do you manage you anxiety how were you able to convince yourself that everything was actually okay if i have a dream about myself i can make sure to do everything i can to rule out my dream diagnosis but because its someone else i feel a little weird asking them to check out something to do with their health because of a dream i had any help is appreciated,post-pandemic

im definitely very socially anxious especially when i have to say hellogoodbye to folks people at the doorreception at work etc when i was badging out today the lady was happily wishing have a good one with a big smile to everyone but for me she did wish but without the smile part of it is i have the male version of what they call resting bitch face even if im really happy on the inside i hardly smile due to my anxiety around it i wished her a have a good one but without any smile when i looked at myself in the mirror at home doing that even i wouldnt smile back at me i actually have a really good looking smile but due to my anxiety i am scared to even smile i think what if people find my smile creepy how do folks with a not so smiling face deal with 1 not being treated with the same welcome and social ease like everyone else 2 pushing yourself to smile a bit more lack of a smile also creates a very negative vibe around me people dont think positively of me even though im the most positive and welcoming person on the inside,post-pandemic

2016 its close to midnight its dark and cold my door is closed as i lay about to fall asleep i hear something im half awake half asleep so i dont really acknowledge it i turn on my right side and try to fall asleep again but then i hear something i open my eyes too scared to turn back over to see what it is it sounded like someone was crawling beside my bed here i lay trying to figure out what it is then i hear a very loud hey yelled right in my ear i instantly sit up and look around my room but of course i see nothing i must just be paranoid 2005 it was a few months after my mom married him i never really liked him when he did what he did i was too young to understand what it meant hed put me on his lap grab my sides and butt when my mother was working he called me his favorite it was just touching then how i wish it never had to be more 2007 we had just got back from a family party the first time it happened it was really late at night and my mother went to sleep as soon as we got home i remember being half awake as she told him to carry me to bed as i was already sleeping from the car ride home their room was upstairs mine was in the basement as he put me to bed he started touching me by then i was awake he was on top of me and told me to be quiet as he held his hand over my mouth i remember crying and looking out my bedroom window counting in my head thinking of when it was going to be over i was in so much pain when he was done he told me again how i was his favorite i couldnt do anything but cry the next morning my mom was already gone at work and there i was stuck in a house with a monster 2013 it was going on for a few years now yes i did want and try to tell my mom about it but i was so scared she wouldnt love me anymore and would blame me for it happening so i never did because he said if i told she wouldnt want me anymore in school my grades dropped my attendance dropped and id never pay attention i felt so alone and so scared yes i did self harm as i felt that the pain of that would not hurt as much as the pain from him i did run away and when my councilor found out i talked to her i told her an excuse saying i didnt wanna go home because i hated when he yelled i couldnt tell her the real reason was because of what he did to me almost every night i couldnt tell her as much as i wanted to i felt so isolated she called him and he had picked me up from school when we got home he immediately did what he did to me almost every night and said i deserved it for being bad my mom was always out working as she worked two jobs and would really only be home 7am12pm 2015 a few years later and it was still happening i was sick every morning and when i told my friends about it they joked around saying i was pregnant i laughed along but in my head i thought could i really be i remember stealing a pregnancy test from a pharmacy and took it as soon as i got home it was positive i felt sick then and there i wanted to throw up no not from being pregnant but from being pregnant from him my step father i just wanted to die i remember a few days going by as my mom cleaned my room she found the test she yelled at me for not being careful and was yelling at me for becoming pregnant at such a young age little did she know the father was the man she married the man that has been sexually abusing me for years my step father i miscarried at 10 weeks as bad as it may sound i was glad i did 2016 my mom had finally divorced the piece of shit after she found out he was cheating and i had so much relief after that i thought finally no more pain later that year i was constantly getting in trouble doing drugs trying to be cool hanging with the bad kids i was expelled mid freshman year i started going to an alternative school for kids who got expelled from high schools there i met a friend ive known since kindergarten we started hanging out everyday after school i thought to myself that wow someone is actually being nice to me there was this friday where i was hanging out with a different friend when i ran into him and his friends we decided to all hang out and we went in an ally way to drink and he had given me some pills saying it would get me high being the uncaring trying to fit in cool kid i took them and drank my friend i was with had left with some dude that he was hanging with so it was just me him and his other friend we decided to go chill in a stairwell i was so gone off whatever i had taken and from all the drinking i did i remember him asking to have sex and i said no i passed out and next thing i knew he was on top of me as his friend watched i quickly pushed him off put my pants back on and as i ran down the stairway crying i seen him and his friend high five i called my sister for a ride home but didnt tell her what happen when i got home i started crying to my mom but all she did was yell at me for coming home late and didnt even ask me why i was crying i went in my room wondering how could he do that to me someone i knew since elementary school how could this happen as i laid in bed i thought to myself that i was nothing i was already being sexually abused from my step dad for years and now it happens again at age 16 from someone i called a friend by then all i wanted to do was die i thought after that monster was out of my life id be a little okay yet it happened again from someone i knew and considered a friend 2018 i am 18 and i try to drink every weekend i can with older friends because i didnt want to be sober on weekends when i was by myself i didnt want to be alone with my thoughts because on weekdays id be occupied by work so weekends id just drink every chance i could it was not good everywhere i went to drink there was always one dude touching me and pushing his self on me i thought to myself wow i really cant get away from this stuff all my life ive endured so much pain from people i thought were supposed to protect me sure i drank and maybe you think its my fault for putting myself in such a situation like this i couldnt get away from it i thought to myself the best way out of this hell of a loop is taking myself out ive attempted suicide 3 times the past year soon it will be my time to go because all i feel is pain and loneliness im so scarred and paranoid from the things my step father did that every night i have to sleep with ear plugs in and a blanket over my face because im scared that he will be standing next to me even though i know hes gone not the place to post but at the time i just needed it out of my mind and yes cops were eventually involved for everyone asking,pre-pandemic

one year ago today i was sitting in some dirty run down trap house in a tiny bedroom with other addicts helping my boyfriend try and find a good vein in my arm to shoot up in this was my day to day reality i still cant believe just how fast and hard crystal meth took me down ive struggled with addiction for over nine years until about two years ago my drugs of choice were alcohol and cocaine ive never tried things like heroin or fentanyl because my thing when im high is i want to feel energized and awake i stopped using both alcohol and cocaine however when i was introduced to meth meth was like nothing id ever experienced before the first time i used i shot up the rush it gave me was unlike anything id ever felt before i felt it from my scalp to my toes i loved it i decided right there that this was what i wanted this was all i wanted anyways within the first month of getting hooked i sold all my electronics and most of my clothes just to get my next high i was dating a man at the time who was conveniently a meth dealer and so i would also get plenty for free from him it was awful i stopped eating i stopped bathing except for when i could no longer stand the awful stink that was coming off of me i had to force myself every few days to take things like xanax or benzos just so that i could sleep and stop the extreme paranoia and auditory hallucinations it took being sent to the hospital after my boyfriend beat me for the fifth time to decide that i wanted to quit after that i took a long look at myself and where id ended up in life i guess the reality of how awful things were finally hit me and i had a complete breakdown i checked myself into detox shortly after and ive been sober ever since ive joined a support group and we have meetings a few times a week ironically the area where i now attend these meetings to help me stay sober is the same area i used to get high in its the most dangerous part of the city walking through there now that i am no longer using is really shocking and makes me sad people often ask if its triggering for me and why dont i just go elsewhere for help my answer is that i find in empowering to be able to walk around there and not use it shows me just how strong i really am i think that if i can stay sober around there i can stay sober anywhere maybe 4 months isnt actually a lot of clean time but to me its a huge accomplishment for the first time in a very long time i feel like i actually have a shot at a good life like yeah maybe i can do this i cant say for sure that this is it and that ill never relapse addiction is the biggest struggle in my life and i cant predict the future what i am sure of though is that for today im choosing sobriety and if i keep working hard ill never have to pick up drugs again,pre-pandemic

professor gave us 3 exam dates within a week which are all on the same day and classmates are complaining about how they have work or other classes to attend so they cant prepare for any of them at least they have an excuse for potentially bombing the exams but whats mine we had a week and albeit very short it could have been enough yet i spent it rotting away and avoiding what i had to do both from task paralysis and from a growing hatred for this course because of the professor informing us on such short notice and unwillingness to give us more time usually lastminute panic sets in the last 2 days preceding a deadline but this time i cant get myself to give a shit i searched around on the subreddit and people are saying its from often the result of a burnout but its not my case since i didnt get shit done and now i feel more frustrated about it my last line of defense broke from literally nothing,post-pandemic

edit i used to take the blame everything on myself and adhd is not an excuse and a cop out approach in high school but i was beating myself up so much it was to the point where i was having suicidal thoughts because would hate myself so much now i know much more about adhd and the affects it has on people and i began accepting myself a little bit more but i i want to get anywhere i have to hold myself accountable however i am afraid i will end up beating myself up again much like in highschool so im hesitant on how much do i hold myself or probably what is more correct how do i hold myself accountable without beating myself up because i dont want to put myself down over things i cant control,pre-pandemic
ive been an alcoholic for about 10 years its gotten progressively worse in that time i drink because of my anxiety and i also find it comforting thats about it i wouldnt say that i do it for fun ive been working in sales for the past 4 years i recently decided after learning that my brother was murdered id go ahead and start drinking throughout my shift starting in the morning very hard shit to comprehend and i suppose it gave me an excuse to ramp up it actually did help me have better conversations with people over the phone and led to more meetings booked i was also much more comfortable in our weekly sales meetings my cold call strategies were shared with my team it was depressing in a way to realize that drinking seemed to be the solution for me in order to progress in my career ive gone through some serious shit in the last 10 months and i cant seem to escape the pain the only thing that helps is to drink which i know will if not already be my downfall i dont know how to get through life,post-pandemic

i recently experienced my first severe anxiety attack and described about it in my previous post a couple days ago two of my classmates reached out to me inviting me to join their team for a hackathon at first i declined because i have spent the last 2 weeks just searching through internet and reddit about sadsocial anxiety disorder and agoraphobia and because of all the research and investigation all i can think of now is these topics my brain is so eccentric towards these topics i am unable to keep my mind straight and think of anything else due to this i declined their invitation the next day they told me that one of their teammate backed off and they want me to join them i started thinking about this and then i called my mum to ask for permission she accepted it saying dont miss out on opportunities as soon as the call ended my brain started thinking about anxiety attacks and i started having flashbacks of that day i was quite alright for the past two weeks no sensations no anxiety no hand trembles whatsoever but as soon as the call ended my hands started shaking and i started feeling palpitations my eyes started tearing up and i started to get scared again thinking what if i experience another anxiety attack while i am away in a different city i did not feel any anxiety for 2 weeks and then started feeling really anxious in just 2 minutes,post-pandemic

hi folks im using a throwaway account as id like to be completely honest about my experiences i want to raise awareness in our community about the potential negative effects of wellbutrin also known as bupropion before i begin if you have found success with wellbutrin thats fantastic i will not suggest that anyone should drop a drug regimen that they find helpful we are all different and please note that i am only speaking anecdotally with that said please be aware that wellbutrin can cause very subtle yet extremely negative psychological side effects you should exercise extreme caution when taking it i dont believe that my doctor was fully aware of just how much influence it can have on a patients mental state some of wellbutrins powerful psychological effects are not acute but instead manifest over several months this delayed response makes it nearly impossible to realize that changes are occuring much less pinpoint what is causing them i hope that writing this might help other young men and women question the impact of a prescription that they might otherwise dismiss as harmless or only marginally impactful my background im 30 years old diagnosed as inattentivetype add when i was 13 i took dexedrine and wellbutrin for five years from 13 to 18 i trusted my physician and did not put much thought into the matter i made a casual choice to stop taking all medications around age 18 during my final year of high school and would only dose occasionally during studying ive recently resumed a regimen of a single long acting stimulant trying dexedrine biphentin and settling on vyvanse perceived effects as a teen the most notable aspect of wellbutrin to me as a teenager was the fact that i didnt actually feel any change at all dexedrine provided very obvious stimulant effects but wellbutrin may as well have been a placebo to me it came into effect on my personality over a long period of time and its lack of acute impact left me thinking that it was rather ineffective i was not diagnosed with depression when i was first prescribed dexedrine and wellbutrin they were selected for me after i had appetite issues under a daily dosage of ritalin the initial effects were similar but i had no problems with eating this was considered a success so i stayed with this combination my roomates suicide attempt my roomate was prescribed wellbutrin as an antidepressant and smoking cessation aid last year she was diagnosed as clinically depressed and had tried a couple medications before finding some success with wellbutrin despite being depressed she had never been suicidal or severely emotionally distraught over the three years we lived together her depression generally manifested as inattentiveness and a lack of motivation in her work and studies i believe that in her case she entered a negative feedback loop of use she was taking wellbutrin to alleviate symptoms of depression when it was in reality not only failing to treat her symptoms but magnifying and intensifying them ill skip the details but she barely survived the suicide attempt her doctor removed wellbutrin from her regimen with positive results over time she was very forthcoming in telling me what she was prescribed and i realized there were many disturbing similarities between her behavior leading up to her attempt and my experience as a teenager similarities and possible effects in hindsight the following is a short list of problems that i had attributed to hormones or had accepted as part of my personality at the time they are remarkably similar to my roommates experience 1 severe body image issues this was in spite of being normal even attractive in appearance i had minor acne but would spend hours picking at my face in front of mirrors i obsessively cleaned myself shaved body hair short and plucked my eyebrows im male 1 emotional instability and disproportionately intense responses i would cry myself to sleep several times per week in response to minor problems often without any reason at all it was the male equivalent of being in a constant state of pms i was extremely melodramatic when it came to love and relationships at this time it felt cathartic and even pleasant to recall several depressing thoughts in a row to cause myself to cry 1 prone to anger and violence i was suspended from school and sent to an anger management course after an extremely disproportionate response to light bullying i could be easily baited into yelling matches i hit my brothers punched walls kicked appliances and even went to so far as to return a slap from my mother during an argument 1 suicidal thoughts i suppose this was the natural result of the preceding effects i vividly remember contemplating suicide at age 17 because a vein on the side of my closely shaved head visibly moved with my pulse i found it repulsive and dreaded facing my classmates 1 insomnia and restlessness at night i consistently had trouble sleeping i would lie awake with my mind racing these experiences closely correspond to what my roommate went through before attempting suicide its been over ten years and i dont suffer from a single thing on this list today i now realize that my improvement roughly corresponds to the time when i stopped taking wellbutrin consistently i find it incredible that i never questioned these thoughts and feelings i never sought help and i never even for a moment considered that i could be so fundamentally changed by my prescription drugs i only stopped taking my prescription on a whim dexedrine was obvious it came on quickly and left just as fast the greatest danger of wellbutrin is its subtlety you cant fix a problem that you arent aware of and you wont ask for help when you are blaming yourself i hope this helps some of you ive read several comments on this subreddit from users who have had negative experiences with wellbutrin if you are taking this drug and your experience sounds in any way similar i urge you to consult your doctor,pre-pandemic
hi ive struggled with this on and off since i was a young teen i grew up in the suburbs with immigrant parents and one older sibling who was always out with huge groups of friends or gfs and never home my parents never ever went out socializing felt like a burden to them didnt have too many friends couldnt spend too much money holidays were just another day at home never anything special it wasnt until the last decade now that all kids are grown and theyre retired that they started traveling the world and taking up hobbies and making friends when i was a kid and i complained about feeling cooped up at home they couldnt relate to my anxiety i always felt like my close friends always had other groups of friends or huge families where there was never a weekend or day theyd be home moping always had groups of friends besides our core friend group so on random occasions where every person was occupied it always hit me how extremely lonely i feel now as an adult it still hits me here and there everyone knows im an extreme introvert and love being home but lately ill be home for 34 days straight cant bring myself to leave my 1000sq ft apt i live alone in to get the mail take out trash or drive to run errands as my simple socialization for the day i have a bunch of things i could be doing outside errandwise or at home chorewise ex decluttering closets getting some freelance projects done job hunting etc but instead i cant bring myself to do any of them and fixate on my loneliness i let the dishes pile up eat junk foodinstant ramen just waste hours on youtube or the internet sit around crying for no reason and when people text me to hang out i decline i dont understand whats going on with me its like ive reached such a level of being a slob that i cant bring myself to get ready in 20 min to go outside and hang my family will even ask to have dinner or something and the thought of having to coordinate 3 different parties and choose a restaurant and think about 5 hours of productivity i wont get back though lets be real i wont be doing anything productive gives me extreme anxiety im torn between wanting to bask in solitude and being miserable being so lonely can anyone at all relate or is this an issue specific to me since childhood am i just a lazy pos and thats my problem,pre-pandemic

hello im not sure what im doing this is my first time on reddit lol i dont have a therapist or anything i hope to get one in the future because i really do need helppeople to talk to ive always felt lonely since i was young i never liked asking for help or talking about my negative feelings with other people i hate when people feel sorry for me it makes me even more sad when others look at me like im a victim theres so much to say and i dont even know where to begin i apologize for how messy this is typed im attempting to categorize my thoughts ive been okay this year made some new friends after the friend who i thought loved me as much as i loved them hurt me its a long story but i never really had a bestfriend except from when i was young i tried so hard with her and i never saw her in a negative light she felt like a sister i never really had but i found out this year that all of that was one sided and the entire time she judged and used me that really fucking got to me now my anxiety and sadness is through the roof and im scared to get close to anyone but at the same time i need friends i feel so lonely and i try so hard to be good to people but even that is not perfect but nothing ever is ive been bailing out on plans and avoiding them when i feel anxious i have this thing where i feel i need to be perfect otherwise i wont be liked and when i make a mistake for example a friend that i really like is upset with me for bailing out on multiple plans which is understandable i completely understand her feelings theyre all 100 valid no doubt about it but for some reason that mistake of mine is eating me up inside its making me so sad because i try so hard to make my friends feel heard and loved i dont want to lose anyone i need people and im willing to fix that about myself i just hope she can give me a chance to the fact is i need people more than they need me i love caring for people and making them feel good so when i fuck up or fail other people its like im fucking up and failing myself i try so hard but i still feel like im not trying enough i crave real connections and friends im so fucking sad i hope this all makes sense thank you for reading i just need to feel like im not the only one who is like this lol,post-pandemic

to determine whether i had asd i was given a neuropsychological exam needless to say i was diagnosed with it part of this exam included the waisiv iq test and the wiatiii test of academic achievement i scored in about the 50th percentile on both so average both tests however measure different skills and give individual scores based on each one the overall is all of them averaged out the discrepancies in these scores were remarkable i always knew that i was unusually crappy at a lot of things but at the same time very talented in others but this proved it in the verbal comprehension and written expression sections i was in the 99th percentile in some other sections such as mathrelated stuff working memory and processing speed i was borderline intellectually impaired i know thats the opposite of how the people in movies with savant syndrome operate they are supposed to be able to do dizzying calculations in their heads while at the same time having difficulty with language one possible reason for that is that i have also been diagnosed with nonverbal learning disorder which is incredibly similar to aspergershigh functioning asd it is characterized by typical symptoms of either as well as difficulty with math visualanalytic skills and motor skills contrasted with superior verbal skills most people who have it also have deficiencies in complex reading comprehension but are exceedingly good at things such as spelling and word recognition i must also note that my difficulties in math are less about mathematical reasoning and more about arithmetic i am a total boss at logic puzzles but numbers screw me up i do think that my case is more extreme than most cases of nld my english language skills are impressive even by neurotypical standards i learned how to read when i was three or so and by the time i was in first grade i was reading at a seventh or eight grade level i had the highest reading level in the school and it went all the way up to fifth grade i took the act in seventh grade and while my overall score was only 21 i was in the 93rd percentile for englishreading i believe i was in the 10th for math it was similar for the sat which i took in eighth grade although i may have been in the 98th by the time i took the act again as a junior i was in the 99th for englishreading and i got all the way up to the 13th for math hooray in high school i tested out of the english class that was impossible to test out of after reading 5 out of 7 of the required books in the span of a week i did well even though i had only read the cliffs notes for two of them i then proceeded to get an a in the lit class that nobody gets an a in i was often considered to be either one of the best or the best writer in my ap lit class despite the fact that most of the other students in my class had 40 or higher averages and i was scooting by with about a 23 my senior year sorry if it sounds like im bragging im really not trying to im proud of my english skills but i honestly suck at a lot of things that one needs to decent at to function properly i sometimes feel like im half genius half idiot its really frustrating sometimes tldr i have insanely good english skills but i am borderline intellectually impaired in other areas i think i might have savant syndrome edit ah yes there were a few dodgy commas and such in my post you are all very smart i suppose the label is unnecessary anyway i just was researching the idea and got excited i tend to do that a lot,pre-pandemic

that was the text message i sent to my best friend last night manic out of my mind and hallucinating animals everywhere i had convinced myself i was possessed by an evil spirit and having to fight it for control of my mind i had convinced myself of a lot of things by then and my mind was moving way too fast for rational thought then something amazing happened i actually put my safety plan into place took my prescribed dose of trazodone and basically knocked myself out for a while this morning i woke up still hallucinating but not the least bit manic ive even stopped hallucinating as the day has gone on guys this is a victory for me its the first time ive ever been able to think through my safety plan while actually manic and put measures into place to stop it going further i have terrible self esteem and am not typically one to point out accomplishments but i am proud of this no one but those who have been there would understand the depth of it,pre-pandemic
to explain i used to live in a decent sized city and i found backroads in the country that takes me on a nice drive away from all of the light pollution and its nice to just be away from people and enjoy the country anytime i was feeling down or negative i would just hop in my car and go the drive took about an hour and it was really peaceful by the time i got home i was usually in a much better headspace i just really loved that drive when explaining the drive to a girl i was really into at the time she was talking about how its impossible to remember that drive and every turn because there are many i have driven on those roads enough to remember exactly when to take each turn i proceeded to go over every turn about halfway through is when i began to overthink everything does she actually give a shit about this you look stupid just stop the usual i then stopped halfway through everything gave like a half smile and said that i had forgot this is just something that always goes through my head there are probably better explanations on this but this is the first one that came to mind thanks for letting me vent guys,pre-pandemic
i want to join a hip hop dance class i love dancing in my own room and it would probably make me so happy to join a class but im just so so scared it feels like all emotions are more intense and that includes nervousness i know i wont be able to sleep beforehand and be nervous all day possibly to the point of shaking and vomiting its so extreme that it feels like these things are often not worth the fear beforehand similarly i also want to join a board game group but im equally frightened how do you guys deal with nerves i dont want to feel as scared as for a job interview every time i try something new then in class the first few times will be harsh i will be surrounded by attractive and fit people and have paranoid ideations about them looking at me i really wish it wasnt so hard it would be so nice to just feel good and attend something that you know will make you happy a little more easily its not even new i actually joined many dance classes in college but i selfmedicated with drugs and alcohol then sometimes and once i get started its better besides in college i was often on a social high which is harder in adult life what healthy coping mechanisms have you guys found to deal with fear anything would be appreciated,post-pandemic

so as the title says i will be clean for 10 years tomorrow im pretty proud of myself im a 25m i started doing snow when i was 13 when to treatment when i was 15 ive relapsed twice in those 10 years but every time i got back on that horse it has been really hard 2 years after being clean i was allowed to take care of my autistic sister again 5 years and my family in another city allowed me to come visit them again year 9 i had my worst relapse and the hardest year i went through bouts of loneliness and anxiety my grandpa passed away he was the only one who understood my addiction and help me through alot of it so i relapsed for a week and then remembered his memory and his words life is hard and most people try to escape using all sorts of means like drugs sex even video games but the people i respect the most in life are the people who dont try to escape hardships there the people who stare life in the eye and say bring it and when life gives them all the shit they grin and bare it because they know without lifes hardships you would never appreciate lifes good moments anyways im posting here because if anyone is going through a hard time just know the thing i am most grateful for and proud of is quitting drugs and when i have a hard day and think about using i think of my grandpas words and his memory and how i want him to be proud of me anyways this is the 1st year i wont be able to celebrate with him and it hit me hard today but just know even though i miss him and its hard i wont be doing drugs and its all thanks to him and him never giving up on me love ya grandpa,pre-pandemic
i will always remember my last super bowl before my sobriety it was 2 months before i got sober and i knew i was fairly certain i was alcoholic my wife and i were visiting south beach for a long weekend the kids were at home with my parents we had already gotten into a full blown argument upon arriving at the hotel the first night of the trip as i was totally smashed from the 25 hour flight and even went to lengths to essentially bribe the flight attendants to continue providing alcohol service to me she went to bed mad and i went down to the bar to keep drinking i was able to keep it together the next day saturday with some hair of the dog at breakfast and more or less beer during pool and beach time i had to be on my best behavior after the previous nights antics by and large while drunk that day i was able to keep it toghether and not go into my full blown debauchery superbowl sunday we ended up going to brunch with some coworkers of my wife who worked in her miami office brunch was tame until i was able to convince a few of the coworkers husbands to try some of tequila with me that looked good and was recommended it was my treat damn that hit just right and went down smooth now normal folks dont do multiple shots of tequila at 11am even in south beach and because i didnt want to embarrass my wife i didnt persist trying to convince everyone to keep taking shots but that didnt stop me from conveniently having to go to the bathroom or make a phone call which led me directly to the bar out of our tables site to continue doing several shots by myself the rest of the day was a pool day prior to going to our friends home for the game who had moved there several years ago i remember being drunk at the pool big surprise but i was used to getting hammered all day and making it out in the evenings in the interest of making this short we arrived at our friends and of course drank but what nobody knew is i was doing my typical shady shit slipping into the other room where the bar was and taking pulls from whichever open liquor bottle i wanted the night ended up with another argument with my wife as i wanted to go out after the game 9am flight be damned whereas she wanted to go to the hotel and pack for the flight i relented but grabbed booze for the room and continued the party by myself i passed out of course forunately my wife always the responsible one made sure we were packed and we were able to make the flight it was a good 23 day hangover after i tappered for a bit but i knew at this point i was in big big trouble with my drinking two months later my lovely caring and faithful wife was crying in our living room saying she couldnt do it anymore she had spoken to divorce attorneys and if i couldnt fix this she was prepared to leave if you knew my wife like i do i knew this was an incredibly hard thing for her to do she had giving it much much thought and for her to do this she was as serious as a heart attack ultimately it clicked i got smart the next day i called a family member who had been 15 years sober told him i think i may be an alcoholic i was so concerned about not being able to drink ever again his advice was simple go to an aa meeting today call me when its over and just dont drink today and thats exactly what i did this is my 3rd sober super bowl but for some weird reason ill always have a special place for my last drunk one because it got me here,post-pandemic

hey there 21f here its a long story but im a very troubled person a lot of screwed up things have happened in my life anyways for a while now ive been using substances to cope i started vaping when i was 15 and havent really stopped since started smoking weed consistently when i was about 19 and although have cut back not that much i went through a phase where i used a lot of mdma i also went through a phase where i used a lot of ketamine i liked shrooms but also did them a bit too often but soon after probs for the better started a medication that blocks the effects of psilocybin so no point in doing them i also enjoyed acid didnt do it very often but then ended up having a seizure in july after taking some one time so dont do it anymore i also had a seizure a couple years before that because of an accidental overdose on a psych med i was taking another long story anyways a couple days ago i took a bunch of my prescription adderall and also a good amount of cocaine about the cocaine ive been addicted to it for almost 6 months now i hate hate hate it but i love love love it i know i need to stop and i think what im about to tell you is the catalyst for me finally quitting that stuff while high on the coke and about a day after taking way too much adderall i was having a conversation with my partner when all of a sudden one of my words didnt come out right because my jaw involuntarily jerked like a convulsion i brushed it off for a second but then i got this terrible feeling over my entire body and i cant really describe it i knew i was about to seize i immediately stood up from my chair said to my partner im seizing and laid down on the floor horizontally long story short with the help of my amazing partner i was able to breathe through what i was feeling and maintain consciousness its hard to put into words but i felt like i might have a heart attack or seizure or simply die at any moment i remembered the great conversation i had with my mom that morning how she lives across the country from me how she is clueless to the extent of my substance use problems btw please dont tell me to be honest with my parents because the situation is complicated beyond belief i felt such intense sadness from thinking about losing my life but mostly those who love me losing me not necessarily because im valuable and worthy of love but they love me and it would hurt them if i died i made a neurologist appointment to make sure my brain is ok i have no intention to do any more coke and i really want to stop but its hard to trust myself youre probably thinking by now how havent you learned your lesson silly girl i wish i knew the answer life is very painful for me a lot of times and i have a hard time trusting loving and believing in myself i feel so stupid i dont want to rob myself of my life i know i have potential but i also feel like a waste of space so much theres a million important details missing from the story so please ask questions before making assumptions or judging me i promise you nothing you can say to me will be meaner than anything i havent already said to myself if you read this far i love you and thank you,post-pandemic

so my fp has been encouraging me to act on my desire to adopt a cat in the past week specifically a black one whos perfect for my needs from the list of 4 options i sent them tuesday wednesday night i had this weird feeling of exhaustion like we needed to take a break from texting eachother but they seemed kinda depressed wednesday night so i didnt say anything about wanting some space thursday i was gonna let be a notexting day but i caved cuz i needed a pickmeup i was also freaking out cuz the black cats owner replied to me saying someone was interested and i panicked my fp calmed me down and even offered to find a cat and just bring it to you semi jokingly i felt bad for how much we were texting and yesterday friday im having a hard day and they tell me that their spouse convinced them to get a 3rd cat a little black female and theyre on their way to get cash for the adoption fee they were at the pet store for litter and just randomly fell in love with a cat that looks just like the one i want i was honestly crushed with jealously i confirmed that they had been telling their spouse about me stressfully wanting to get a cat now they have 3 cats and i have 0 cats and i feel like maybe their spouse felt insecure the 2 cats they have came with them into the relationship this new impulse cat is theirs as a couple and they just moved into a newbigger apartment its hurtful cuz tbh wish i was my fps person but cant be i wish i had someone to go cat litter shopping with on a thursday night exactly 4 years ago i experienced this same thing with my ex adopted a 3rd cat who felt like our daughter vs our individual cats we finally felt like a family until things went bad at the end of the day they probably have the resources to take care of her but i honestly wonder if my fp and i hadnt been texting so much wedthu if the spouse wouldve even wanted a cat and now i feel enviousguiltpathetic and gross on multiple levels,post-pandemic

for years i couldnt make it past 3 months now im almost at a year my life has changed in so many beautiful ways i am dually addicted to both drugs and alcohol i was an injection user who had one vein left on my body by the time i made it to detox i remember the nurses had to get approval to draw blood from a vein in my neck because it was the only one left they said there was only 6 patients they have done that to since they opened and still i didnt think i had a problem 15 years of hell 15 years living in a different world because i couldnt handle reality i had to be so high i couldnt walk opiates were my doc but i would do anything you put in front of me i craved that rush you got after injecting an opiate because it was the only time my body relaxed i did one pill after another until i was nodding off and couldnt keep my eyes open long enough to cook up another crawling around on the floor with a flashlight trying to find loose beads because im so dope sick all i could think is how pathetic am i i overdosed i died for 2 mintues and they brought me back and i still argued with the doctor to go home so i could keep using i lied and said i wasnt using even though they showed me my tox screen my life was so unmanageable i was a complete mess who lost all empathy compassion and love for other people and myself today i look in the mirror and love who i see today i am honest today i make an honest living instead of selling myself just to get by today i make others smile instead of cry today i am me and that demon is losing every day that i go to bed clean i never thought id be where i am today and i never thought i could be happy while sober i promise you you can do it you are not alone and the pain you are afraid to feel is only temporary once you begin to feel and process those emotions your life is worth living and no matter what you did in active addiction it doesnt define you you are a good person you deserve happiness and you deserve a life free from your addiction i know it feels impossible especially when you are withdrawling but recovery is possible you can do it just take it one minute at a time im always here for anyone that wants to vent im proud of all of you and i hope you find your path to recovery it really is worth it wishing all my fellow addicts another 24,pre-pandemic

shes right here in the bed next to me her liver doesnt liv anymore and her kidneys have closed up shop her blood pressure has dropped to the point where the meds are the only thing keeping her alive tomorrow we find out if the transplant committee is willing to overlook her drinking and take the chance that she might change if they say no shes never going to wake up the doctors will try to make her comfortable until she dies if they say yes and they find a donor in time and she survives the transplant and gets through recovery and manages to stay sober she can live a good life none of those ifs feel particularly likely at the moment my little sister is 34 we didnt have a great childhood our parents drank a lot and left us to our own devices more often than not we both developed maladaptive coping mechanisms i binge ate and sunk unhealthily deep into fictional and video games to the occlusion of all other aspects of my life she drank and worked then drank while working and worked while drinking i never drank much eventually i got my life together lost a bunch of weight went to school met my wife bought a house had kids ect i dont understand why i took this path and hers was so different my parents bought a bar and hired her to run it she was good at it she turned the business into a huge success and she drank her husband was an exploitative abusive immature jackass he drank a lot to and they drank together i thought when she divorced him last fall maybe things were turning around she just drank more i am irrationally angry with her with our parents and with her ex husband all the people who were close to her and watched this happen when they werent encouraging it im angry with myself for getting so wrapped up in my own family that i wasnt there for her she could have stopped she could have taken the path of healing that i found so ralcoholism here i am i needed to vent i appreciate that you exist update 1011 the transplant committee said no shes too sick to survive the transplant and hasnt shown the kind of sobriety that they need to see to feel comfortable giving her a liver update 1012 were taking her off life support today,pre-pandemic

im just venting here ive had ha for several years now and sometimes its unbearable but there are of course things that make it easier like sleeping more prozac eating healthier etc but man do i wish i could just be normal have a drink and not think twice about alcohol causing heart palpitations staying up really late without worrying about what symptoms ill have in the morning not having to agonize over every food i put into my body because of what the health effects could be sometimes im so jealous and mad at people who dont have to experience this kind of anxiety day in and day out like it must be nice to not worry about imminent death or fatal diseases all the time on a positive note prozac and therapy have changed my life and even though theres no cure i highly suggest self care cutting out googling symptoms and diseases and exercise i made this post mostly because im in the middle of a relapse and feeling pretty salty about it,pre-pandemic
over the past few years i kind of lost everything my relationship of 4 years we had two dogs that she kept too my car which i had to live in for a while after the breakup after that i kind of just drifted around moving from city to city never able to find any lasting friendships or sense of home i had an apartment that after i lost my job i couldnt afford rent so i had to sell all of my belongings so then everything i owned just fit in a backpack and i had a little money to move so i went back home and stayed with family and that didnt work out so now im with my grandma and my mom and we all are just really sad a lot i dont have any friends here and i met a girl but she had a lot of problems and kind of just used me to help her with them until i guess she found someone better and then just dipped and i find myself with the money to be able to move again to my old room in a buddhist commune i used to live in but the city where that is is kinda just full of people who used to be friends that dont really care about me anymore no fault of their own i guess they just outgrew me im not like super depressed or anything yanno im kind of used to this bad thing after bad thing life now but it does get lonely i sometimes feel like its always going to be this way that i failed and pushed all of my friends away and that i got what i thought i wanted but idk its confusing and exhausting and im not sure where to go or what to do the way i see it is i have complete freedom no obligation or responsibility but the freedom has become a prison i feel walled off from any meaningful relationships and ostracized from groups i was once part of ive considered burning my birth certificate and ss card and just doing some alex supertramp into the wild type living spend what i have on living outside and just be in nature thats the level its gotten to lol and even in that pursuit i still would want a companion someone to runaway with i feel like my whole life i have always dove for people and joined their life but never really had one of my own and id like to have a life with someone you know not like their life or my life but our life someone who would just live in nature with me and build a cabin and just escape the modern world for a while to get rooted and grounded thats more of a dream than anything realistic though ill likely have to take that journey on my own maybe ill get a dog anyway thanks for reading,post-pandemic

so many of us feel stuck in our heads so get of your head and into your body magazine article link think of exercise as medication says john ratey md an associate clinical professor of psychiatry at harvard medical school for a very small handful of people with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder adhd it may actually be a replacement for stimulants but for most its complementary something they should absolutely do along with taking meds to help increase attention and improve mood rat studies show that exercise reduces learned helplessness in fact if youre aerobically fit the less likely you are to learn helplessness so im just curious 1if you are working out how has it helped you 2 if not why arent you working out yet,pre-pandemic

i dont know what it is or when exactly it developed im 28 years old and i thought id grow out of it by now but honestly i think its worse than it has ever been when i was a kid and we had a landline i would answer the phone and talk to my friends on the phone all the time it was never a big deal now i cant even call my parents without taking some deep breaths and really mentally preparing myself i had a job interview on thursday i was offered the job but told them i needed time to think about it they said to call them this weekend with my answer as soon as i heard the word call my stomach dropped i spent all day yesterday battling my phone call anxiety and dealing with anxiety induced ibs and wasnt able to bring myself to call so i put it off to today first thing this morning i took some valium and had to sit in silence for 30 minutes doing breathing exercises before finally dialing the number and calling aaand i had to leave a voicemail that was over an hour ago so ive basically just been sitting here staring at the wall suppressing my panic and frequenting the toilet a lot as i await a call back my hands have been sweaty shaky and numb my throat feels tight my stomach is in knots and it is literally just a simple phone call where all i need to say i accept the job and just ask a few basic questions i would have no problem emailing them or even going to the business to talk in person so why is it that phone calls are so fucking daunting for me my entire weekend has felt wasted because of how much energy ive expended dreading this call i also only got about 5 hours of sleep last night because of the anxiety why am i like this is anyone else like this any tips for how to overcome or at least manage it,post-pandemic

hello im a 19m in college and i am a junior i have 3 semesters left of college including my current semester until i graduate and go and find a job or do a masters when i began this semester i had a bad realization that for a reason hit me very hard now but not other times that i have no real friends except family usually i am ok with this and looking for new friends but at the beginning of the semester i became very anxious and began thinking that since i have no friends i have no social circle which means i will never find a woman which means i will never have a family and so i will die alone and by myself this realization hit hard for me last week and i think its because i know college is one of the last places to find people your age to hang around with and i am already a junior and have no friends i am quite anxious shy and an overthinker and the last week have been hard i have found some people to hang out with at school this last week through reddit however i havent managed to build any good relationships so far if i cant get a good social circle it will be much more difficult to do so when i leave college i went out with someone this week and we had an ok time however i dont think we fully connected but i still have his number today i went to an event at my college and i was planning on talking to someone to make new friends but i was so shy and anxious i simply couldnt however right towards the end of the event i mustered up the strength to say my name is what is your name he told me his name anxiety came over me and i just left without saying anything even though the guy seemed quite nice once again the realization that i will be lonely since i have no friends in college which means no friends ever i will die alone hit me hard and i was crying badly leaving the event until i came home and am writing this sorry its so long but i havent cried in many months and this is something special to me i want to make friends but it is difficult i want to have a life and be fun and enjoy myself with good people that i can consider friends but i just dont know how to find them i have met some other people at my school through reddit and i do plan on meeting them as well but i hope we can build a good relationship and connect could i please get some advice on anything honestly thank you so much,post-pandemic

so i started smoking quite regulary since november and until a few days ago i didnt think it was a problem but now im not so sure im quite broke right now but i still spend money on weed and ciggarettes im doing a break from smoking for a few days just to feel more in control and because i run out of weed also while on break i got a little drunk alone and without an occasion just to feel something fun but the problem is i want to smoke so bad my evenings feel so fucking empty i should also add that before i started smoking weed i didnt do much in the evenings i could spend the few hours scrolling i wasam in kinda depressed state but weed helped me even when i go on breaks i feel better now scrolling sober is boring and i technically could find a hobby to take up the time i spend high but i feel like it could be even better with weed so itl also feel empty so my question is is it really as much concerning as i think it is because for me its pretty concerninv and i dont want to stop smoking weed forever also im autistic and adhd so im technically higher risk of getting addicted but addiction doesnt run in my family edit also i feel like weed really helped me become more overall happy even when im not high and get out of the house i go on these 2 hour walks which are fucking the best,post-pandemic

nobody without an eating disorder thinks anorexia or bulimia is real anyway unless youre absolutely on the brink of death and god forbid you have a bingeeating disorder because then youre just a fatty with no self control restrict all you want and nobody will worry as long as youre not an obvious bag of bones in fact theyll just think youre vain and stuckup or applaud you for being so healthy nobody gives a fuck about making you uncomfortable with constant comments and jibes about your body so why should you care about potentially making them feel like assholes i announced today at work that i was going out to get some lunch a female colleague snidely remarked i thought you only ate one meal a day i told her that in fact i was not going to eat and only said that i was to shut her up because she couldnt keep her mouth shut for five seconds about my eating habits for once she had nothing to say,pre-pandemic

borderline personality disorder isnt being cute and clingy and adorably needy being with romantic or otherwise someone with bpd isnt akin to taking care of a pet bpd isnt an aw its so endearing that they need me so badly type of thing bpd is a mental illness that is a conglomeration of several different tendencies and its not easy to diagnose you dont just decide you have it just like you dont decide youre depressed because you had a bad day or you dont decide youre bipolar because your mood changes quickly sometimes believe me you dont want it bpd is turning nothing into everything is knowing youre being irrational and not being able to stop regardless is suppressing breakdowns for fear of being abusive or of manipulating the person youre talking to into having to take care of you when they really dont want to its thinking someone doesnt care about you anymore because they made a new friend its automatically registering new people as a threat its a fear of abandonment and rejection thats damn near omnipresent its being able to shift from i love you so much to i dont give a fuck i hate you i dont even want to talk to you and back at the drop of a hat its finding identity in a drastic hair change and then feeling unsafe and desperately trying to fix it before you have to go out its seeing someone you adore and trying to emulate them because you have no idea who you are its waking up and trying to be a new person every day go vegan go goth go hipster go glamour cut your hair change your makeup gain weight lose weight and never feel quite there ever its comprehending love as pity and wanting to rip yourself apart if their tone is all too casual when your friend or love interest is returning compliments or affection its regretting saying anything about your mood and desperately trying to turn the conversation around while simultaneously needing to get it out its wanting to bleed yourself dry as opposed to cry in someones arms because at least then they dont have to clean your wounds for you they wont hate you they wont be annoyed its the constant battle every time you get upset of is this worth being sad about is it worth talking about what is more abusive talking about this or hiding it if i tell them ill bring them down and ill guilt trip them and they will resent me and it will all be my fault if i dont im a disgusting liar im manipulative im untrustworthy its wondering if youre faking your symptoms its disassociating and feeling like a ghost for days its feeling like you arent real and then wishing you werent its fear a lack of self and about a million different thoughts running through your head at all times its trying to live for the people you love as opposed to yourself its feeling suicidal and then feeling bad for feeling suicidal because whoops youre being manipulative,pre-pandemic
i 25f and my boyfriend 34m have been together in an official capacity for over a year but have been seeing each other romantically for closer to 2 years during this time we have been through some very challenging times my mom passed away and left a lot of hard things for us to work through financially logistically and emotionally for me i have had my own struggles with alcohol during this time but feel like i am in a much better place with my drinking these days my boyfriend however has been excessively drinking for probably the last 10 years or so nearly every night i have tried to push him to get sober on several occasions the longest stretch of sobriety he had was over this past summerfall for about 45 days we had a conversation the other night where i shared that his alcoholism is causing me to have a lot of resentment towards him and that i do not want that it was an amicable and wellreceived conversation and i thought things were changing for the better i love him so deeply but yesterday valentines daywas the straw that broke the camels back for me i had an awful day at work and had a bad migraine i came home and took a nap i woke up and he had made me one of my favorite meals surprised me with flowers pulled out all the stops i was so surprised and felt loved and appreciated we had a great meal and then afterwards i was like i really want to walk to the gas station around the corner and grab my favorite ice cream and he agreed there is a dive bar across the street from my place and he asked if we could pop in and have one drink i said sure why not thinking this would be like a cheers to us moment we would get the ice cream go home and watch a movie he invited our friendneighbor to come which is a separate issue but hurt my feelings too because its valentines day for crying out loud and then immediately started doing shots after about 45 shots and a couple of mixed drinks he decided it was time to go we got my ice cream and walked back i went to the bathroom and came back and he was passed out on the couch and peed on himself i woke him up and told him to go to bed and then ate my ice cream alone and cried and fell asleep after cleaning up the mess i am so torn and deeply hurt i felt like we were making progress and things were getting better but clearly they are not he is so resistant to getting help and taking action and i know i cannot force him but i love him and we have been through so much together he really is a wonderful partner but his drinking and everything that comes with it is tearing us apart i dont know what to do i never want to feel the way i did last night ever again,post-pandemic

its difficult for me to even say this but i feel it to be very true i lived in that world for many years lost brothers to violence constant worry and fear that you will be next things of that nature much of which begins at a fairly early age 15 years old for myself it often times feels as though society as a whole does not give a damn about those of us who survive to be productive adults which leads many to go undiagnosed and afraid to seek help at 35 years old i have been fortunate enough to reach out to deal with the many traumatic events that have plaqued my mind for years just yesterday learning a name for what i have been experiencing since i left all that behind at 29 years of age while it feels good to know a name for thishypervigilance i think in todays day and age people who have walked similar paths should not be ashamed to ask for help and also be accepted in a sense we know the things in are past are wrong and immoral many of us have payed for our sins in more ways than one would think just a rant and i appologise to anyone i have offended thank you,pre-pandemic
i have never done this before but i feel like talking to someone who can understand what im going through can help i had 2 friends commit suicide in less than a year both were close to me ever since i lost them i feel so hopeless i fee like suicide is the only thing on my mind i found a perfect girlfriend and i loved her she loved me too but we broke up a few days ago i feel so lost i have no purpose i have no one to talk to about this i have no friends who wanna stick around when i need them to i dont wanna die but most of the time i feel like i have nothing to live for anymore i dont speak to my family and i live all alone i havent eaten anything in 4 days now and i got 7 hours of sleep this week i would appreciate any kind of advice and if anyone would like to talk to me it can help me a lot,post-pandemic
ive been a peoplepleaser saying yes to everyone and everything no matter if i wanted to or not but lately theres an immense feeling of guilt associated when i try to say no and even more so when im actually able to say no im so exhausted all the time and in pain i cant go to work or do basic tasks i just want to sleep and when i have a tiny bit of energy i love playing games online with my friends to change my mind of things i think my family is worries about me being so sick lately so they push to talksee me almost everyday even when i tell them i want to rest i feel so bad for putting my boundaries down and wanting to be on my own i love them and i appreciate their concern but their constant worry and need to be with me 247 is driving me insane i dont want to disappoint them or make them worry so i mask all the time in hopes theyll leave me alone but they dont im so tired of everyone and i feel so guilty for wanting to rest and spend time on my own doing things i love because im not with them,post-pandemic
the hardest part is probably having to handle and process everything without getting messed up to cope im facing so many difficult truths and having to take a journey of self exploration and i dont like myself the thing is it gets easier im facing demons ive spent my whole life running away from but being sober allows me to process and heal my mental scars,post-pandemic
edit wow i really expected to be roasted for calling myself empathetic i had no idea so many people felt this way too and i feel much less alone wishing everyone peace,pre-pandemic
i keep trying to rationalize it away and say to myself that im just being overly dramatic that i spent half of today on the couch staring at the ceiling in torment because im lazy i guess its easier to keep telling myself that im a piece of shit than it is to say that im broken im getting real tired of people being nice and helpful i feel patronized i tell myself that i could have done that thing someone else did but i cant i tell people dont do that thing i will take care of it but after me not being able to take care of it for a few days it quietly gets done i feel like a leech edit thank you all i had a rough night and really needed the support,pre-pandemic

trigger warnings for discussion about sh and emotional abuse and physical threatening hi so ive recently been diagnosed with ptsd this is due to moments with my father where he put me in a situation where i felt i had to physically defend myself or where he threatened to hit me not ideal but not the most horrible causes of ptsd but i have a lot more emotional trauma that really haunts me every day and here comes my question i notice that i have recurring like headaches but theyre not really head aches more so my brain feels tense and foggy but i can feel it physically at times it can really feel overwhelming its not something i experience in any other way and the only way i can describe it is that i can just feel the trauma being processedrejected in my brain and it sucks and at times can make me feel very hopeless it can trigger heavy emotions and even trigger feelings of wanting to sh is there anyone who can relate to this feeling i never assumed youd be able to feel trauma in your brain physically but at times it gets really bad and then once it passes i feel clearer a bit better but them in a day or so it starts again i can only relate it to the feeling of pins and needles,post-pandemic

a little bit of context i have known my friend since 7th grade i have graduated college already and he is currently enrolled in college i live in a different state right now than him so i cant visit him often in person but we do communicate on discord on occasion my friend has been known to abuse substances in the past and weve tried helping him to the best of our ability he moved away to canada after high school and got into hard drugs like meth and cocaine he has been able to stay drug free for a while now i dont know exactly how long but he is still on alcohol and has severe mental health issues he told me recently that he has been drinking a lot 650 ml of 66 proof in 4 hours every night after he gets home i was on a call with him and he was talking about how he is very anxious about the future and he suffers a lot throughout the day when he is sober and drinking doesnt fix the anxiety he is jealous of his roommates for having a happy life as a couple while he is alone in his room suffering from alcoholism i tried to talk to him and see if he would be interested in going to a club at his university even once to try and talk to people and get out of the house he was asking me if a symptom of alcoholism is hating everyone and not wanting to talk to anyone also he doesnt reach out to me or any of our other high school friends but will answer our calls and sometimes join us in discord maybe once a week he told me also the main thing he wants is to be with a significant other but has too much baggage like alcoholism anger management anxiety a chronic muscle condition due to clenching from anxiety etc i know he is struggling and i know its not as simple as just go talk to someone but i dont know what else to do i hate to see him struggling and i want to know what steps as a friend to help him get the help he needs to get out of this mental rut hes in thank you for reading and id appreciate any advice or help you can give,post-pandemic

hi my names sean ive been battling an opioidopiate addiction for 34 years now i think it all started back in 2016 or so i have an illness called ulcerative colitis and if you know anything about the illness youd know it is pure hell the crampspain the embarrassment the isolation its a lonely and painful illness mostly because it prevents you wanting to go out due to constant trips to bathrooms and messy accidents ive shit my pants both at home and in public so many times i lost count you become a homebody and thats not me im a very extroverted guy i love going out having fun shopping partying going to concerts and sports games im very social and i have a lust for life so to speak i remember i started smoking weed when i first got the illness and yeah weed helps but only so much i remember i got a job because i forced myself to it was my first job i was around 18 years old i had a girlfriend and everything so i wanted to impress her my family and friends and show them my disease wouldnt defeat my spirit then i had a bad flare up and when i say bad i mean bad i had to leave work and call out so many times in this two week span and i remember talking to a friend and i told them that nothing really helps for pain except weed but i dont like being high at work i dont work well high he said have you tried percocet i said no of course i havent i had never done anything but weed i didnt even drink at the time he let me borrow a handful of them and told me to let me know if they worked for me and boy did they work i took my first percocet right before a shift i had i was so green i thought this probably wont do anything i was so wrong i felt nothing and everything at the same time no pain no problems no worry i was fucking superman even my coworkers would say wow man youve changed to me in the following weeks i would use the drug i developed this dependence on it because the drug helped make me feel normal which is all i ever wanted and helped me function at home at work at social events i was a different guy i was hooked on them for about two years after that before i quit and honestly the withdrawal period was the worst and lowest point of my life but at least i was clean despite all the pain i was clean i ate better started working out i had friends again but i dont know what happened i got a bad flare and after 7 months of being sober i had to so i took another percocet and when i tell you it was simultaneously the greatest and worst feeling i ever had the greatest because the feeling of euphoria and pain relief couldnt be beaten by a thing id choose this over the strongest orgasm any day of the week and i know that sounds so bad but it is what it is thats what it is like i relapsed in may of 2019 after being sober 7 months and now after a few months of abusing the pills im trying to get clean again im going through withdrawals right now and its the most agonizing pain you could ever go through especially with my ulcerative colitis too it intensifies the pain from that and its so hard for me to keep a smile on my face not snap at anybody and leave my bed i cant be up 10 minutes without falling asleep standing up or missing my bed i sleep but i sleep so brokenly i wake up in intense fits of almost traumatic pain and tbh shit my brains out it feels like theres a knife in my colon scraping against it and then in addition i have these uncontrollable shakes burning fevers cold sometimes freezing sweats im almost 4 days clean now and today im gonna try to have my first full meal since quitting its hell but theres a silver lining and its that i know i can beat this again and anybody else going through it i want you to know that you can too i guess the point of this post is to enlighten and welcome others either going through it or have gone through it or know someone going through it its going to be okay you will beat it choose life like the movie trainspotting said lol hope this helps sorry for how long it is,pre-pandemic

i recently hit 34 years old mark and been living with sa for as long as i can remember i fought it like hell when i was younger going out socializing forcing myself out of comfort zone and to help me do that i pretty much always used some kind of antidepressant but around age of 32 i somewhat gave up and accepted my condition as whatever i did wasnt really helping me it was strange that i worked so hard for it and had nothing substantial to show so eventually that question whats the point arrived so kind of nihilistic mindset set in for a while lived a reclusive countryside life tending my garden working hiding in my house sometimes communicating with family members only no real social life whatsoever a year ago though parents convinced me to try psychotherapy which i am still going to the specialist is nice understanding but i was always asking her why the hell am i like this why cant i win this fight recently she dropped a hint that i might have aspergers somehow doctors failed to diagnose me right i dont have many strongvisible symptoms so maybe thats why my only issue is anxiety specifically with people so reading more about it its clear that this condition affects brain structure physical brain changes in languagesocial regions of the brains how can one live with that how can one accept this if true and changes are physical i will never get over this anxiety and life will never get better will always remain a hermit hiding how can one make peace with it has anyone dealt with things like this,post-pandemic

when i was fat a boy called me a beached whale in front of our sports class the teacher told him to settle down as i felt my cheeks burn when i was fat a friend jiggled my double chin and said if i just lost weight i could be pretty she told me my chubby cheeks made me look like a squirrel when i smiled it took me a long time to learn to love my smile again after that when i was fat my dad asked me where he went wrong as a parent how could my brother be so athletic while i ballooned each year in this household where carbs were practically a reincarnation of the devil himself when he found the empty ice cream containers and chocolate wrappers he told me i was disgusting he said he was embarrassed to tell people i was his daughter when i was fat i bought an expensive jumpsuit for a big upcoming party i spent hours perfecting my hair and makeup i squeezed into heels so that my legs could look long when i got there the boy i liked looked me up and down turned to his friend and loudly whispered fat b they laughed and left and i wished i could fall through the floor when i got home that night i cried because i was a shy nerdy girl and i couldnt imagine what i had done to make him say that i thought i used food to control my emotions but really i was controlled by food every night when my family had gone to sleep id pull out thousands of calories from underneath my bed id buy it after school from the grocery store a different one each time because i feared the cashiers would recognise me and see exactly where all this food went my cheeks my waist my thighs id stuff my face until my stomach ached and the nausea crept up my throat and i was sure i had abused myself enough to truely be the beast people told me i was over the past year ive lost enough weight to now be on the low side of a healthy bmi ive basically switched to a restriction ed largely driven by the comments of people around me and today the boy who called me a fat b asked me out for dinner after over a year of not seeing each other he said i looked great and he wondered why we didnt talk more in high school i wanted to break down and yell at him for ruining my self esteem i wanted him to know how many nights i had spent crying over his careless words but instead smiled and said i was happier leaving the past in the past i dont know why i wrote this i guess im just frustrated with how the world works i wish i could have enjoyed high school i wish people could have seen more to me than just my weight i wish i didnt think about food constantly oh well,pre-pandemic

i have been meaning to talk about my experience with wellbutrin and this seems as good a time as any wellbutrin was the first thing my doctor prescribed for me when i was diagnosed earlier this year he has had success with it with other adult adhd patients im 28 i started on it around halfway through december i didnt feel any immediate any effects but i figured that it might take awhile to build up in my body after four days i left with my wife and kids to go stay at the inlaws over christmas i forgot my pills so i had a forced break for a few weeks week 1 i started on the pills again as soon as i came home but i still did not notice any improvements after six days what i did notice however was that i was kinda itchy the location seemed to vary from hour to hour and places that i scratched welted up after ten minutes or so week 2 on day seven of continued wellbutrin intake i spent the entire workday absent mindedly scratching the hell out of my hands that evening they were twice their normal size and incredibly painful the next day i discovered that i could draw wonderful pictures and profanity laced diatribes on my arm with a fingernail and in a few minutes my artistry would appear in glorious 3d that finally convinced me that something might actually be wrong so i coerced my still swollen fingers into dialing my doctors clinic he agreed that i might be experiencing an allergic reaction to the wellbutrin and told me to stop taking it and to get some benadryl for the swelling on the way home from work i had a little tickle in the back of my throat but it was winter and i had been fighting off a cold for a few weeks so i thought nothing of it once home i ate some food and attempted to watch more than two minutes of any one tv show after finally settling on an episode of adventure time i heard a slight whistling sound but it did not distract me for long halfway through the show i realized that my breathing was wheezy i heroically pressed on in my vegetative endeavors until met with the unignorable conclusion that i was having trouble breathing as my family was still out of town i considered driving myself to the hospital but as most of you will probably agree waiting rooms are a special kind of hell for adhders so i instead decided to pop a few benadryl and went to bed over the next few days i managed to link coughing with my throat swelling up so i stopped coughing as much as possible and took benadryl when required week 3 the doctor was still concerned that the reaction did not seem to be abating so he prescribed me a few heavy doses of antihistamines they got rid the itching and swelling but put me in a profound and constant stupor so i stopped taking them after four unproductive days the next afternoon i felt the beginnings of that familiar itch on my arms but it faded over the rest of the day and did not come back conclusion so here is what i learned from this adventure 1 stop taking new medication at the first sign of an allergic reaction 2 antihistamines make me tired 3 dont go to sleep in an empty house without the full use of your trachea ive been on dexedrine for a week now so i hopefully that means that i am in the clear and will not be repeating that experience again tldr procrastination in dealing with the side effects of wellbutrin to help curb my procrastination forced me to take antihistamines that exacerbated my procrastination stldr procrastiception edit while the title seemed a great idea when i was writing it i have since come to loathe it and everything it stands for,pre-pandemic
i used to be absolutely terrified of my grandmother throughout my entire life she would mentally and verbally abuse me when i turned 24 i had to move back in with my parents because i couldnt afford rent after losing my job due to her age and worsening dementia my grandma ended up living with my parents as well it was like her dementia lifted the veil on how she truly felt about me she no longer bothered to hide her disdain for me the way she looked at me it was as if she wanted to harm me in some way even though i am an army veteran and a grown man i was genuinely scared of her my bedroom was connected to hers through a jack and jill bathroom and i always made sure to lock my doors and block them with a chair i truly believed that she would try to kill me in my sleep thankfully she eventually passed away while i felt sorry for my moms loss i couldnt bring myself to attend the funeral or offer my condolences my mother understood and supported my decision she also stood up for me whenever my grandmother would verbally attack me i often have ptsd flashbacks in my head of how menacingly she used to stare at me am i a bad grandson for feeling this way i know most people cherish their grandmother but i just cant,post-pandemic

im sure weve all seen the memes the t shirts etc with jokes about guzzling down a bottle of wine or a six pack the jokes about getting blackout drunk and just basically abusing alcohol like its not a serious health problem i dont want to stop those who can consume responsibly from having fun but thats the key word responsible binge drinking is talked about these days like its something to be proud of and i believe this winealcohol culture is causing many who are suffering from addiction to not seek help because they dont see it as a problem in addition i think this culture makes is so hard for a recovering alcoholic to stay sober when you see things promoting drinking everywhere you go how could you not be triggered again i dont want to ruin anyones fun and i think drinking in moderation is acceptable if you can do it but i do think theres a problem with the way people glamorize binge drinking,pre-pandemic

okay so im currently 17 and my autistic 14 yo brother wont do anything for himself my mom expects me and my dad me and my brother moved in with my dad last november to do everything for him i need to wake him up make him brush his teeth make him have a shower and do his dishes my dad also has to make his bed do his laundry take time off work everyday to pick him up fast food because he wont make himself anything all day he will just eat potato chips and my dad has to prepare special meals for him which he usually wastes the whole thing to on top of all that he makes a fuss about everything and is just very nastybratty to everyone like every time i have to make him do something he yells at me and throws a temper tantrum i cant even look at him or talk to him or he gets very nasty and yells at me dont look at me there has been times were he has not even wanted me in the same room as him its like he hates my guts or something for no reason like ive not had a proper conversation with him in at least 5 months despite me being home a lot but still busy because i did online schooling all he dose now since hes on summer vacation is sit in his dark musty room play video games while eating chips and drinking soda all day honestly it looks more like laziness to me then anything since my mom babied him his whole life i mean literally waited on him hand and foot since shes a stay at home mom she never enforced him to do anything like everything was a option even things like brushing his teeth because he would throw these huge temper tantrums so she just gave in i mean he still cant talk right despite having speech therapy his whole life and was literally still shitting his pants at 12 i mean come on but she doesnt understand that we have lifes we cant constantly be adjusting are schedules and catering to him for everything like she did my dad works full time monday to friday and im going to college in september but im currently volunteering doing side jobs going to classes for my hobbies going to the gym hanging out with friends etc on top of that i do my own laundry my own dishes make my own bed make my own food take care of pet maintenance for are many pets water all the plants clean the house etc i dont know what to do here its like if everyone stopped doing everything for him he would rather just waste away then get up and do anything,pre-pandemic
how could having a relationship be a good idea when most of us on this thread are probably really unstable some getting their thoughts out some contemplating ending it some already having decided and making their last remarks i dont think life has a meaning but i do think love is the closest thing that means the slightest to me the only times in the last 3 years i see shimmer of light is when a potential romantic interest arises the feelings are different to those of friends of family for me selfish to want it or engage when you sleep for 16 hours some days dont respond to meds and are very unstable one day having made plans to end your life the nest cancelling them being paralysed in bed another day all those sorts of things make relationships unattainable and daunting for people like us so unfair and angering everyone deserves love especially those who are suffering and suicidal i feel we deserve it the most but we cant feel it like other people because our mind is torturing us and convincing us we dont deserve it ive turned down girls for poor and unresponsive multiple mental illnesses will continue to do so until my health is stable which is as likely as me winning the lottery heartbreaking,pre-pandemic
hi all over the past 6 years ive struggled with off and on anxiety and panic attacks it first manifested through work as performance anxiety while giving speeches presentations running meetings etc more recently it has turned into health anxiety with any twinge of pain discomfort causing me to feel like im dying and heading to the er i have been taking small doses of propranolol to manage the physical effects to help get me through stressful moments but im wondering if i need something to help with the actual mental effects as its starting to impact both my work and home life my wife has been begging me to go see a doctor for the past 6 months but im worried that any medication they prescribe will really limit my ability to function normal at work itll make me a zombie any examples of medication helping your work performance would be tremendous thank you,post-pandemic

ive never said this to anyone especially not trauma survivors but i dislike the belief that trauma molds people into better stronger people i think anyone who experiences trauma has a right to feel stronger more empathetic braver etc if that is what they feel from their unique experience but its okay to not feel that way its okay to feel angry sad scared hurt and any negative feeling that comes from experiencing a traumatic event i am a survivor of childhood sexual assault and i fing refuse to attribute my positive qualities and achievements to those traumas before the traumas i was happy confident full of life trusting the sexual assaults literally altered my body and brain development my childhood was hell it was my inherent strength that got me through not the events themselves maybe for some people their trauma helped them see that they were strong and brave all along but i already knew that about myself before it happened i actually lost confidence in myself for not being able to stop the abuse when i tried im not some happy smiling cheerleader who says rape made me better because it didnt maybe for some people it does but not for me eta i know why some survivors say their trauma helped them grow to be stronger more thoughtful and better people because they made themselves learn to cope in healthy and beneficial ways which makes them feel stronger as people theres nothing wrong with that and that is what i agree with that is an empowering thing to know you got you through not the adversity but what you did to face it and overcome it but some people dont attribute their strengths and positive experiences from the traumas itself and thats okay everyones feelings are valid but we do not all feel the same and should not be lumped together please dont invalidate commenters in this thread for discussing their feelings because its not easy to talk about this thank you,pre-pandemic

ive dealt with substance abuse and addiction for a long time in my life ive personally used more drugs than most have probably even heard of and ive been hooked to my fair share of them throughout my many soires with dependency ive learned a good deal about how addiction works and because of that whenever i see others discuss it it makes me so sad and sometimes even angry at their ignorance when people discuss addicts most of the time they do so with a tone of disgust and animosity ugh these people make me sick we shouldnt even narcan them do the world a favor addiction is a choice you got yourself here its your fault i can understand their resentment perhaps they have personally been hurt by an addict maybe it was their family or friend maybe they have been stolen from lied to or betrayed after this it can be hard to find pity for them because from the outside it is so easy to say why are you choosing to do something that hurts you and everyone around you why do you keep doing it but thats not how it works when you are gripped by addiction you dont get to make a choice the choice has been made for you the only choice you get is the choice to live or die and our inherent desire for self preservation is a powerful driver the heroin addict isnt choosing to be a heroin addict theyve fallen into the same trap that so many others have fallen into before them the trap of escapism the healthy happy person doesnt choose to shoot up there has to be some deep discontent that drives them to any avenue of relief if you live your whole life being miserable and one day you discover a cure for that misery its not quite as simple as just dont do it it can seem like the only option the only escape from the incessantly servile rat race of every day life imagine being given the cure for your constant debilitating pain and being told you cant have it and you just need stronger will power i see this attitude with other non substance addictions as well particularly with food addiction theres this disgusting attitude i notice on reddit where people shame the obese under a bullshit guise of benevolence because shame makes people change no shame doesnt make people want to change it makes them hate themselves even more it makes them apathetic miserable and desperate for any sense of comfort that shame is what drives them to overindulge in the first place and the lack of empathy and arrogance of these people who insult and degrade other human beings disgusts me i hate the lack of empathy i hate the ignorance i hate that we cannot just for once reach a hand out to the people who need it i hate that we cant just for once say im here for you youre loved and you can get better these people are whats wrong with the world not the addicts the addicts are sick the others are hateful fools something i wrote a long time ago on a dark and lonely night the darkest sky birth to the brightest day the forgotten hours in which he waste away the lonely man looks to a new days sky he was void and cold but could never cry the sunrise now no beacon of hope a symbol of deviancy with unknown scope his eyes burned and his head fought back worries and fears the minds payback dawn had come and so he went to uphold his ungodly covenant with his rites the battles ceased quelled his demon fed the beast the darkest sky the most forgotten hours the only time free from the souls devour his spirit cursed forever corrupted and unclean his reflection blighted such is the fate of the fiend,pre-pandemic
to start ill tell you my history with adhd throughout my schooling there was a huge gap in my marks between the subjects i was interested in and those that i wasnt in highschool i took a long objective look at my thought process when it came to studying and registering information i noticed that i often experienced a lot of whats commonly called mind fog a failure to grasp a thought process when i had no interest in it this didnt exist for things that i enjoyed quite the opposite periods of hyperfocus would allow me to stay up all night reading articles and forum posts while absorbing all of it with ease whereas sitting down to read a new book i would find myself reading along with my eyes but thinking about something completely different within a page i barely passed highschool and spent a year upgrading my credits afterward it was only after flunking out of college that i took my concerns to a gp and eventually a psychologist who diagnosed me and started me on the path of treatment through medication and lifestyle changes its been about two and a half years since then ive moved and been rediagnosed four additional times ive been prescribed ritalin concerta vyvanse wellbutrin and adderall and through this process ive come to gain a lot of control over my symptoms but also recognize a number of concerns about the diagnostic and treatment process as well as how the conditions viewed by not only those subscribing to the stigma but those who are well researched and diagnosed like many in this sub diagnosis ive never been presented a diagnostic process that didnt begin and end with filling out a one to two page questionnaire about my self observations of mood energy level productivity and self control the first 3 were the exact same one page test about 10 questions asking me to rate myself on a scale of 1 to 10 where the doctor would compare my answers to an overlay chart of answers that corresponded with adhd these questions were incredibly open and simple i immediately noted how easy it would be for a drug seeker to simply tell them what they wanted to hear as soon as my answers matched up with their answer key i was handed a prescription for controlled stimulants the most in depth of these tests was two pages and included similar checklists being filled out by my parents and employer ended up just being my employer as my parents are in a different city again easy to manipulate if i wanted to and a lot of the questions were very vague could have been answered a lot of different ways and still be truthful depending on how i chose to read it ive only had one doctor who drug tested even now that im prescribed 30mg adderall which is fairly rare in canada and on high demand in black market environments my doctor just trusts me i even told him i would be open to drug testing when other first line medications werent working to me this is incredibly frustrating as adhd is so stigmatized as an excuse for lazy students and employees and the medications are so widely abused many many people dont think the condition is real and honestly i dont blame them for a second when getting a diagnosis is this easy theres no question in my mind that a huge percentage of adhd diagnosis probably arent accurate or could be managed with lifestyle changes alone medications shouldnt be handed out this easily even prodrugs and nonaddictive like wellbutrin and strattera should be viewed as an aid to the improvements already gained from a change in sleep patterns diet and exercise above all of this i have complete control over my medications and doses my psych simply asks me if i want to try something else or raiselower the dose im not asked to keep a journal no one around mes asked if theyre observing any improvements side effects or anything i could completely binge out to the point of psychosis from amphetamines and just keep it together enough for a 5 minute appointment every two months and walk away with a higher dose and more pills community im using this sub as an example because its the biggest community of diagnosed people im exposed to regularly ive been shamed for saying this in the past but i constantly find myself rolling my eyes at the posts where a blatant lack of self control and responsibility is excused by ones self as an unfortunate and unchangeable aspect of the adhd brain it seems like an adhd diagnosis immediately becomes a catchall excuse for a lot of people to blame every negative aspect of their personality on and it creates a terrible reputation for those who are actually trying to improve and work past their attention problems i know im not alone when i say im hesitant and embarrassed a lot of the time to admit to someone that i have adhd and usually when i do the persons initial reaction is exactly as i feared and expected ive tried criticizing one of those posts on another account of mine with these same points and was told that i needed to be supportive in this community im sorry but just as i wouldnt support anyone in the healthy at all sizes movement i wont encourage and provide a stage for those who arent willing to improve themselves i dont want this to be a rant theres a lot of awesome people here wanting to learn to improve themselves and work past their symptoms and just as many offering them great advice my intention is to encourage this community to promote a more serious reputation and understanding employ a tough love approach when needed for those who are making excuses and do as much as possible to contribute to further understanding of the adhd mind and how to make it work to their advantage i appreciate the audience and would love to hear your own thoughts and feedback,pre-pandemic

i might just be bitter but sometimes it feels like people who say itll get better or there are many things to live for havent been suffering enough one common argument i see from those who try to make someone reconsider suicide is that some trivial compared to decades of agony thing like music or nature is worth living for sure sunsets are beautiful but when i see one it doesnt make me forget about my constant yearning for the sweet release of death its more like what a great scenery i would enjoy it more if i didnt want to kill myself every second of my existence id rather people not say anything than lie or delude themselves into thinking they know what its like for the past seven years i havent had a single day where id look forward to the future except for the scenario where im lying on the ground with a hole in my head there are no ups and downs just a constant state of emotional and physical pain ive been in since i can even remember myself it is just a simple truth that its not going to get better,post-pandemic
hiya i dont know if i actually have anxiety i dont get panic attacks id say i kinda had half of one but it was over so soon and i dont get the shortness of breath thing at least i havent yet is anxiety something you have to be born with i feel like when i was a kid i had a little bit of it but now i feel like its worse is that possible or did i get more dramatic i feel like i worry about everything ive worried about taking too long to put my things in the back trunk while people were waiting and was almost crying about that i worried about everyone dying when i was 8 i dont know if thats anxiety though i dont have a diagnosis so does that mean i dont have anxiety if i dont get panic attacks do i even need a diagnosis i feel like my constant worrying interferes with my life at times but i dont know if its anxiety being anxious and having anxiety are two different things right so how do i tell them apart are there like specific symptoms i know panic attacks are but i dont think i really get those i had this one time where i just started crying after i saw someone respond to an important question and i was scared to open it i dont count that as a panic attack though because all i had to do with sit on the floor for like 5 minutes and calm my breathing it just ended like that so i dont count that lol this got rather long and badly formatted i didnt really know what to label it but i guess id just like to know the main symptoms of anxiety,post-pandemic
i dont know if this is a bpdspecific thing but thought id ask ive really been struggling lately with boredom i usually jump from obsession to obsession its always something unexpected so at least that can be fun and every time my obsession fades ie i dont spend every waking hour thinking about it i feel completely drained of life not only does the thing i was obsessed with no longer do much for me but nothing does anything for me i dont have healthy hobbies interests or coping mechanisms i dont have friends or an emotional support system i dont have anywhere nice to go or a way to get there or any money all i can do is try for hours to find something to keep my mind at ease but nothing hits so all my frustration boils over and all i can think about is hurting myself i feel like i need to break out of my own skin i feel weighed down and i hate it my options are usually to eat sleep or get high and i hate even doing those things if you deal with this too how do you get through it if you even can i feel like boredom literally makes me a risk to myself it gets so bad,post-pandemic
anyone else struggle with words that can mean extremely different lengths of time based on the context these three examples are just from this week 1 my partner and i went to a movie then took a weird circuitous route to stop to get food then went home while driving they said oh hey we were just there me huh thats not the movie theater partner oh no the bowling alley we were there two days ago 2 pizza instructions said step one remove plastic wrap and leave on tray step two bake on lower rack took me a bit to figure out they meant even though leave is with the preparation step it stays in effect through the baking step because leave on tray could also mean leave on tray so it doesnt touch your dirty counter before putting it in the oven and then when baking only use the rack 3 i had a piano lesson on saturday my teacher said hey i could do a lesson next saturday or next monday i interpreted that as the monday after the next saturday based on the context of that sentence but then realized later that it could have either meant the 19th or the 26th im exhausted by how unclear english is i do a lot of asking for clarification but sometimes like the piano lesson one i dont realize im interpreting it differently until later another time word that has a huge range of meaning any suggestions for coping with time words any commiseration would love to hear your thoughts,post-pandemic
hello just a quick one from me im currently on 80mg of methadone and along with the heroin i was a using at the time i was also injecting an awful lot of cocaine there are actually medical journals on this topic but nothing is set in stone so im going to share the results it causes in my body 35g 8th of pure cocaine could easily be injected by me over 36 48 hours i got put on a new epilepsy medication 2 years ago and as the dose when higher and higher i noticed that i wasnt getting the same feeling from cocaine the same way heroin feels when you have a bag whilst on methadone its just mehhh i hope they can use this going forward as another drug in there arsnel to fight cocainecrack addiction has anyone else experienced this effect and yes injecting super strong stimulates directly into my body whilst suffering from epilepsy is an absolute stupid ideamore than stupid even though i had lots of bzds injectable ones also it was still playing russian roulette actually had a cardiac arrest once from a speed ball taken in a hospital toilet and it took 7 mins to start me again and now i have brain damage from itdrugs are bad,post-pandemic

twmention of loss im going through a very recentclose loss right now and one of the things that has came out is the extent of his addictions cocaine and potentially opiates i knew the cocaine was getting out of hand wed discussed it and were going to go to the doctors when he was back home to try and get some help whether this was meant or not im not sure wed had the conversation before but it seemed different this time i think he actually wanted help at this point we had a very open non judgmental relationship im fortunate enough to never of had any issues around drug addiction myself he mustve been using in myout complicated house and i honestly didnt know there was times i knew and the opiates arent confirmed but match up with withdrawal symptoms etc he wouldnt even touch paracetamol though when in pain so im not 100 im purely going off withdrawal symptoms cocaine doesnt have the physical affects as far as im aware during withdrawal it also couldnt be anything needle related as i saw his entire body pretty much daily and never saw any marks etc im trying to get my head around a lot currently and just wondering why he hid the extent when he 100 knows i wouldnt of judged him so if its not too personal can i ask people who have hid it why,post-pandemic
there was one night where and i had 0 reason to really believe this was logically true i believed i was having a full blown heart attack and could drop dead any second like i said there was very little logical basis to this i didnt want to go straight to the hospital again the process takes hours upon hours and i was determined to break the compulsive habit since i had gotten my heart checked out there not long ago at all and i was totally fine however i couldnt possibly stay home by myself i was driving myself up the walls with anxiety i kept feeling like i was dying instead i brought my laptop and sketchbook to this cafe thats open late near where i live i simply got a drink and sat there watching netflix and drawing and trying to distract myself this actually calmed me down substantially i was in a different environment and also there were other people around if i did somehow spontaneously pass out someone would call 911 being a part of societyreality so to speak also helped ground me rather than my brain speeding ahead into imagining dying the day after i was totally fine the discomforts i felt that triggered my anxiety the night before was gone after a night of sleep i had nearly worried myself sick but i was alive just a bit of advice i guess if home is too much and you dont want to go to emergency stay somewhere public,pre-pandemic
i just turned 22 and i havent had friends since i was 17 i graduated from high school in 2020 during the pandemic so we were let out of school early march 2020 and eventually lost all my friends they all quickly moved on and i havent spoken to them since high school in 2022 i decided to just delete all of my social media accounts there was no point in having them everyone who was my friend either blocked me or unfollowed me which makes me think they were never really my friends in the first place but i had a great time in high school i miss it more than anything i would do anything to go back to those times but i know thats not possible i miss being out of the house everyday i miss having a social life i miss having people to talk to everyday i miss being carefree and getting into trouble with my friends i miss being young like i said i havent had a social life in 4 years the only people i talk to is my family who i live with during the pandemic i developed social anxiety depression and i rarely even leave my house anymore i have a job where work from home i know i will never be able to make friends again for a few reasons 1 i dont have the same social skills i had back then i am a nervous wreck now 2 i am getting old 3 i have gained a lot of weight since high school in high school i was 120 lbs now i am over 220 no one wants to be friends with a fat bum like myself i know this is my reality i know this will never change so i ask how do you cope lately i have been spending my days crying i dont know how much longer i can live like this,post-pandemic
i am not saying that the victim is to blame nobody ever deserves abuse or anything less than the best in any relationship dynamic i do not think that people with ptsd are merely crying wolf over and over i want to clarify that so that people dont get the wrong idea below is merely my experience and i know a few friends with ptsdhistories of trauma have related to my experiences interpretations x200b ive realized that whether it be friends romantic partners even roommates i tend to find myself with people whom are narcissistic dont want to recover or take accountability for themselves people whom take advantage of me or whom are abusive i know that i dont deserve or want this treatment but i know that my ptsd often takes over and doubts the red flags i feel other people would react to or i allow many more boundary violations than i should essentially i feel as though the ways in which my ptsd has manifested causes me to allow really abusive manipulative etc people into my life whom i wouldnt otherwise give the time of day x200b does anybody else experience this its really started to fuck with my head and makes me wonder if my roommates claims most recent occurrence of this are true especially since hes started to be all buddy buddy with my other roommate since i put boundaries in place and i stopped tolerating his bs it does make me wonder if im just such a fucked up person that i dont even realize im fucked up if that makes sense,pre-pandemic
this is a subset of part of the autism spectrum i have was wondering if anyone knew much about it i was told i have pdd when i was 3 pervasive developmental disorder and when i was 15 i was tested again for any sort of autism in the spectrum and they said i had expressivereceptive language disorder was curious how this might affect me with my main illness schizoaffective or my life in general because ive always overlooked it and never worried about it,post-pandemic
every small sound scares the fuck out of me and i worry about getting killed tonight i was turning up the thermostat and heard a small sound so i ran to the kitchen grabbed my biggest knife and began making sure all the rooms and closets were clear i have to do this like daily i also have ocd and harm obsessions so when i carry my knife when clearing rooms i worry ill lose control and cut my eyes out or cut my hand off this is torture and i just am so sick of living like this im always waiting for something bad to happen all day i listen for sounds and make sure my doors are locked sometimes i sleep with the lights on im just so fucking scared and im just tired all the adrenaline and stress just leaves me worn out,pre-pandemic
growing up i was the social butterfly quick to make new friends always talking i still am some of those things but over the last few years ive noticed myself withdrawing more and more from social interactions and even forming deeper connections with my close friends i think it stems from having a particularly toxic friendship that i ended about a year ago i only met them in person once but they were the definition of an energy vampire i was their therapist yes they had been handed a really bad deck of cards in life and some things werent their fault but their victim mentality and inability to take accountability for their own actions really led to the downfall of the friendship i could not help someone who did not want to be helped and letting them walk all over me was extremely detrimental to my wellbeing not to mention i just got out of a relationship with a man who barely wanted to see me and didnt recognize he loved me until i broke up with him so that doesnt help now with my core friend group im terrified to talk to them the issue with this old friend is i stayed friends with them for so long because i saw a lot of their suffering and some behaviour reflected in me and i wanted to help them i had been through some things they were experiencing i had been the trauma dumping friend but now im so terrified to become this friend out of my friend group two moved away for different reasons and theres only me and two others left in the city being in a trio is hard for me due to past experiences in my childhood and teenage tears being the odd one left out and eventually the other two breakaway from me i havent connected with any of them one on one in years as weve always been a group and it feels like im so far away from them now and im too scared to reach out as im scared it will be awkward or deny my friendship they hung out the two of them and with another mutual friend im not close with her and theres no bad blood we just never really connected and yes they did something that i would not be interested in at all or could afford but because i take everything extremely personally i was hurt by it i know logically that 9 times out of 10 its never that serious ive expressed to my friends my anxieites and oh well im scared all of you hate me and their response was when did we ever say that and their lack of textings in the group chat is stressing me out when they all told me theyre trying to stay off their phones and theres other ways they can be there for me aside from texting but i can feel things changing and im very distressed about it i feel very alone and too scared to even just connect on a baseline because im still so traumatized from that bad friendship yes im in therapy but dealing with my last relationship took the forefront of a lot of sessions beforehand so im just getting into dealing with it now x200b,post-pandemic
tw numbers all censored i discussed some things with my mom today weve always had a good relationship and she knows about my ed im 31f anbp for 20 years i tend to go in cycles between severe and still bad just not as much currently im struggling with a pretty rough restrictive relapse while my bulimia remains a daily occurrence bmi 153 i was telling her about these things and how ive been struggling a lot this week i try to keep my ed chatter non existant with other people because i dont want to be that guy but with my mom im a little more open she got frustrated with me she said that all i think about is what goes in my mouth what i eat what i upchuck what goes in my mouth those were the words she used she also said that my throat looks emaciated but the rest of my looks fine granted i wear baggy shirts over leggings most of the time so you cant see most of my body but stilli feel like ive been slapped in the face her words confirmed what i know is true but hoped wasnt im a glutton who only thinks of what goes in my mouth i am greed personified and after all of my hard work all of the restriction and damage ive done to myself i still look fine ie normal i dont even know what to do with myself i hate myself so much,post-pandemic
i want to say those with anxiety are naturally intelligent people we tend to be vivid thinkers over analytical and creative ive had anxiety disorder about 6 years its getting a little better but i feel like its messed up my brain i cant think clear i dont have interest in things like i used to i have zero motivation to care and many things are overwhelming i feel like its hard for me to comprehend what others are saying and i dont have anything important to say hell i dont even know how to act around people anymore other than my few close friends and fiance my brain is always on its exhausting i obsess about the things that bother me yet too scared to change them has anyone experienced this and did you do anything to improve it sorry if this was long and venty i just feel trapped in my head takes brain out and throws it out the window thank you edit wow thank you everyone for all of your comments it means a lot that we can share and relate here to know we are not alone on this,pre-pandemic

you recently found your phone from 20142015 you were just 19 then wow you look so young you were going through some hard shit man i know you wanted to kill yourself every day and i know there were good reasons but turning to drugs was not the correct answer and you never did feel better in fact you felt 10 times worse scared and trapped like an animal in case you forget here is a short list of the drugs youve done nicotine alcohol marijuana cocaine methamphetamine synthetic spice acid lsd xanax heroin based mdma and psychedelic mushrooms oh i guess thats not a short list huh you were actually a fuck up how did that happen and why didnt you stop you werent happy with your childhood so you became a troublemaker and your friends were troublemakers too so im not surprised they started doing drugs and you did them as well they say that weed isnt a gateway drug but after smoking it for a couple of years you wanted to move on and do more maybe that isnt the case for everyone but for you an addictive personality one taste and one drug isnt enough at any point you could have stopped using drugs but you didnt its not because you didnt want to no its because you were addicted and dont let any version of us tell you different let me take you down memory lane to highlight your drug use okay so this story is a little funny but it shows you how dumb weed is and no you cannot complete engineering college while smoking you were in physics class high because it was right after lunch mr payne handed out some quizzes and it looked like algebra but there were no numbers just variables nobody seemed to understand how to complete the quiz but you had an epiphany all the letters suddenly made sense and the equations were so easy the equations were solvable without numbers you even told andres to cheat off of your quiz because you were so confident after turning in the quiz mr payne graded them and gave them back you made a 17 or something like that you actually thought you were going to get a high grade but it turned out you werent supposed to solve anything just rearrange the variables into formulas and you failed the shit out of that quiz and so did andres im going to keep the memories coming for you you wanted to buy cocaine but your dealer was out of town so you asked nic where to get some he messaged a few people and said he found where he and you could buy so you and nic got the cocaine with the last of the money in your bank account and brought it back to that shitty no furniture apartment of yours it was very compacted and pressed together so you had to really cut it up eventually it was fine enough to snort this coke stung your nostrils and it was very strong stronger than any coke youd ever done nic laughed and said to you that this wasnt coke it was meth he told you he could tell because he was a recovering meth addict so in that drug addict brain of yours you decided to smoke the meth using a lighter aluminum foil and a dollar bill instead of throwing it out you fucking smoked the rest of the meth this memory is so hazy i dont even know if the details are accurate you lived at dennys and had a major panic attack you had been smoking cigarettes weed and drinking all day your chest started to get super tight and you felt like you were dying to this day i dont even remember if this really happened but i think you called dad you told him you thought you were having a heart attack and asked what to do somehow you didnt end up going to the hospital but you really thought you were going to die how would dad have felt if he knew you were fucked up and wasted on drugs how would he have felt if you did die and the autopsy revealed that you odd on something remember syphoning gas from peoples cars wow you really did it all didnt you you worked a fulltime job in construction and somehow managed to live like a fucking homeless person thats almost impressive how stupid it is im going to tell you your story about syphoning gas because its so retarded and dont forget you were high the entire time you drove your car down an alley at around 200am and parked it about 300 feet from where you were going to syphon you left the door cracked and the keys loosely in the ignition so you could get out fast if you had to so on you go carrying your gas jug and tubing until you get to some older vehicles because you cant syphon new vehicles you stick your tube down into the gas tank and get some suction and it starts flowing get your fill and its on to the next one youre now at like your 3rd car and you hear some rocks scatter so you take your shit and bolt down the alley but instead of leaving you keep syphoning just further away eventually you hear another sound and bolt to your car but the fucking door got closed by the wind wow you locked yourself out of your car and youre carrying a gas can tubes and your breath smells like gas that was a great idea leaving the keys in the car to have a head start you hear police sirens and throw the gas can over a fence into one yard the hosing in another and pull up planet fitness on your phone the police blocked the alley and came up to you asking what you were doing you told them you were lost and trying to go to the gym but he smelled your breath then checked your pockets and there was more tubing in your pockets that you forgot about you got put in the back of a cop car and two people were talking to the police outside you couldnt help but start crying because your entire life was a fuck up so far over the course of what seemed like an eternity but was probably an hour the police officer in the front seat was asking you questions like why are you doing this where are your parents etc he got your full sob story which was true but a sob story anyways remember those rocks you heard shuffle in the beginning those were two separate people who caught your ass and they called the police but lucky for you the cop youd been talking to talked them into letting it all slide you somehow didnt get into any trouble i think you used all your lifes luck in this moment one of the men agreed not to press charges if he could speak with you he said i heard some shit in my yard and saw a man messing with my car so i got my gun and was going to shoot but then you ran down the street then the cop told you a quote that i still appreciate to this day he said son there are two types of criminals those in prison and those who are not in prison yet and you are not a very good criminal so i suggest you drop all of this and leave it behind you with that he let you out of the car and helped you unlock your car door at least you learned from this and never stole again writing this is a surreal experience ive been sober for 35 years and looking at those old pictures of you i dont even know you i say good riddance you were a belligerent thieving sob story telling deceiving irresponsible piece of shit you did nothing to prepare me for the future writing this in 2nd person isnt even weird because thats how unalike we are i get my bills paid on time i have a good credit score i am going to college and making good grades i work full time i have morals i stick to i invest in my future i am not perfect but im 10x better than you ever were,pre-pandemic

to provide some background im a 30 year old who was diagnosed with adhd and 2e when i was 56 years old this is my first post in this subreddit i used to hyper focus a lot loose track of time and just get stuck in a problem or activity or learning about a subject i know that this is not something everyone likes but i for the most part loved it being able to just forget the world for a bit and be completely immersed in one task i didnt just have this in videogames or such i still remember being so fascinated by the work of my masters thesis that i would spend 12 hours a day working on it and get so so much done heck i finished the research part of my masters thesis in half the time that it was supposed to take simply because i kept getting hyperfocused on the work but becoming an adult has made it so much harder for me to hyperfocus and i really wish i could do it more oftenboth for hobbies and for work i think it is the responsibilities that come with adulthood and the anxiety that comes with them i cant count on teachers to be considerate when i forget stuff and i cant count on parents to remind me of stuff this anxiety is everpresent in the back of my head and i hate it it prevents me for allowing myself to be absorbed in a subject because there is always the voice saying wait you sure you arent forgetting something i just wish that sometimes i could get in that zone and get shit done does anyone have tips or experiences that could help me here experiences you would like to share,post-pandemic

tdlr i chose ice cream at the store over razor blades after a terrible day still recovering from it but i made the right choice i had a really terrible day last saturday but i did something really great it started off with being coldshouldered by a girl i really like at work didnt start the day off well i then went in and it was chaos for 8 solid hours i work on a psych ward and it was literal hell dealing with really unwell people i wont say any more than that other than the fact it all went tits up multiple times during the day added to that my ex sent me a slew of abusive messages calling me a terrible dad and an embarrassment to my kids i got these texts on my break and spent the majority of the shift holding back tears whilst trying to look after my patients on the ward to top it all off work called me once id got home saying that my paperwork wasnt right and i had to come back in id already taken my seroquel and i was drowsy as hell but i went back as asked when i got home i was more suicidal than i had been in many years i wanted to hurt myself badly i popped out a couple of tablets and tried to work out how many id need to hurt myself like i wanted to i then went across to the store to buy razor blades halfway there i texted my mum and my ex a suicide note fully intending it to be my final night somewhere around the store i caught hold of myself ive been on a diet for months and have lost a lot of weight but i chose my favourite ice cream and went to the checkout i looked at the razor blades but thought better of it i ended up back at home crying into my tub of ice cream but i didnt self harm this time i chose the less unhealthy option i couldnt take an overdose because i knew i didnt have the right combination of pills to do it properly so i replaced them in my meds cabinet and carried on eating i took the least unhealthy or most unhealthy option that night and i didnt hurt myself considering i have borderline personality disorder as well im proud of myself my waist line wont be proud of me at my next weigh in but i still made the right choice thanks all for listening to my shitty story moral of the story make the right choice even when every part of you wants to do something stupid,pre-pandemic
i look at old pictures and videos of me and it breaks my heart i was so full of life even my eyes looked like they had sparkle in them i was so loud and confident and wasnt scared of anything or anyone for that matter i walked with a purpose and a sense of happiness every single day i loved waking up in the morning and i loved going to sleep knowing the next day i would be able to enjoy life again i was artistic and loved photography it was my passion and pure bliss to me i was very social and enjoyed traveling and going out i always felt things with such deep emotion wether it was good or bad and i truly feel like that is why i used to enjoy life so much my siblings loved being around me and i enjoyed their company just as much are favorite thing was to go to the beach and get pizza afterward i would find the beauty in the tiniest things that normally people would pay attention to i would laugh at everything especially with my friends they were the best friends you could ever ask for and i miss them dearly i miss always being known as the hard working person in my friend group i miss sitting outside in the middle of the night on the porch with my dog feeling the breeze and having this content feeling within myself knowing that whatever happens in the future that i would get through it my trauma has taken that ability to feel at peace in my soul and heart i hope one day my siblings wont look at me in such confusion as to why i am not the same anymore i hope one day i will be able to finish an oil painting without dissociating for long periods of time and not being able to concentrate i hope one day i am able to hang out with people without freaking out internally because they want to give me a hug i hope one day i can sit on the porch again and feel that internal peace i once felt before time heals all im hoping time can heal me,pre-pandemic

hello everyone recently my brother in law whos 36 tried to kill himself about a month ago he called everyone in the family and sent goodbye text messages luckily we got there in time and were able to save his life he was bleeding profusely from his wrist and the paramedics patched him up before taking him to the hospital fast forward to the next day and were finally able to see him you can clearly tell hes still upset and almost disappointed that we stopped him eventually he gets moved to a behavioral health facility thats about 2 hours away from us and is 5150d and forced to stay the weekend there we go to visit and hes clearly in a better mood and telling us that he wants to live we believe him eventually he finally comes home and weve been watching him almost everyday now hes a former alcoholic he was sober for about 2 or 3 years before he started drinking again last month which likely spurred him into attempting to take his own life since hes got home hes been drinking nonstop every day getting blackout drunk and telling us he wants to try to kill himself again when we hide the alcohol he just goes up to 711 to get more keep in mind this is all while hes taking medicine that the doctor prescribed him which explicitly says to not take while under the influence of alcohol when we tell him to stop he says im a grown adult and i can drink everyday if we want to and that hes waiting to look for a job because he wants to see if hes going to survive february me and my wife both work full time and we cant continue keeping an eye on him because frankly were worried if we leave him alone and he starts drinking hes going to actually kill himself my wife has her own trauma and this is only raising her anxiety and stress we cant even feel comfortable with him sleeping in our house at night because weve caught him sneaking beers from the fridge at 4 am im so lost and dont know what to do here i need advice from anyone because this is not sustainable,post-pandemic

each day i feel closer to just giving up nothing is going well for me these past few weeks i dont even know if im in a relationship anymore or whats going to happen between us and i dont feel like myself lately these days just pass me by as i lay in my room or try to hang with my friend but it never gets better helped me understand that there is a profoundness in nonexistence after death as long as i put things out there that i did exist and what my thoughts feelings passions or hobbies were i have existed or proof that i did exist at the very least its comforting knowing that once i cease to exist as a person the concept of me or the person i was will exist the pain im feeling right now is just too much for me to handle and i understand that im not built for certain things like losing a relationship i invested a lot of love and care in i just want to stop thinking about those things and just fade away i dont know what to feel anymore life and fate is cruel,post-pandemic
i find that when im feeling and doing good i can make friends and talk to people easily i wouldnt say im a very social person because i very much enjoy my alone time but im able to appear normal hate that word and very social to people i start a connection with someone and everythings great but when im depressed i ignore peoples texts and calls and completely isolate they end up getting fed up and take it personally like i dont want anything to do with them anymore ive gotten better at explaining that im struggling and need space and that its not them that is the problem however the connection is still ost because we dont talk or hangout for weeks and they have more consistent friendships going on with other people anyone relate,pre-pandemic

i was thinking and heard this before in the past a few times but it clicked randomly been sober for almost a year from weekend heavy binger does alcohol when ingested screw up our reward system in our brains including drugs where we are fooled into thinking we are already successful at something aka your reward system was triggered this type of high makes people act in such a way that is the same as when you achieve something great in life made me think why people entertain stupid conversations while drunk or high off coke and i think its cuz you already feel successful because of the high youre on but it really is an illusion let me know what you guys think,post-pandemic
my work is seasonal so i havent been working for the past month i found myself day drinking and i couldnt stop despite noticing it taking a toll on my health i stumbled on a kudzu supplement on amazon that claims to help with cravings it had thousands of reviews of people saying it helped them reduce their drinking or stop altogether i went deep down the google rabbit hole and majority of the little research is positive so i bought it its day three now of taking the supplement the first day it arrived just as i started drinking after taking it i didnt feel the effect of alcohol as much and didnt have the usual urge to continue drinking today is the super bowl and i would be drinking by now but i havent succumb to my urge i also noticed it reduced the effect of coffee and nicotine which makes me think it helps reduce my addictive impulses this is only day three and it could be a placebo effect has anyone tried kudzu,post-pandemic

because i very quickly went off on a tangent writing this and ramble for a good old while i felt it necessary to make this disclaimer before the main body of text where i work is split between two main departments the main store 1 where i work and our restaurant 2 where the other mentioned characters work each of which i shall identify by letter it will probably read very clunky so this is also an advance apology so something happened while i was at work yesterday one of the colleagues i work with 2a that only does a half shift is walking past me to leave i say bye as just a general kind gesture but then she stops and comes over to me she tells me that this other colleague 2x she works with likes me like properly likes me i am somewhat shocked by this information but deep down i feel like i had a suspicion over the last 78 months we had started talking more only at work and only in passing but sometimes we might have normal conversations about random stuff but in the last few weeks i felt like there had been some weird things not from her but from other stuff going on as well like another colleague 2b mocking heart shapes with her hands a couple weeks back and 2x getting a bit annoyed about it but i just passed that off in the same way i would get annoyed if someone was teasing me like that but there seemed to be too many coincidences to have happened recently for me not to be suspicious of something but today there were two incidents one where a colleague 2c and i were talking about my past week and i mention that i got very depressed on wednesday as i had gone out on valentines on my own great idea i know anyways he goes on and says stuff along the lines of there will be someone out there for you but its what he says next that sticks with me you could find love here now thats a bit odd to say but i carry on the conversation as normal until that conversation ends an hour or so later the subject of this post 2x comes outside and we kind of strike up a casual light conversation not about anything in particular its then during this that another person 2d comes outside and says having a little flirt are we it was in a jokey way but the look she gave him i joked about silencing the guy there person to which she laughed before going back inside and thus ending that conversation fast forward back to the original paragraph where 2a delivers me this information talking about it briefly i admit that i kind of also like 2x myself but i am too scared to instigate in any way i have had one previous relationship it was very brief but i fully committed myself to it at the start so when it didnt work out it hurt me very badly indeed so i tried to articulate my best that i would be interested in talking to 2x more but was not aware if she would have been interested if i had asked and she had said no then i would have been so embarrassed and i wouldve felt really uncomfortable around her from that point on i said to 2a that if she 2x wants to talk to me about it then she would need to actually talk to me properly about it so theres a lot going through my mind about all of this now i cant directly approach her now because 2x will know that someone has let slip to me likewise i dont want to just wait around in case she stops being interested i insinuated to 2a that she should sort of nudge 2x to start trying to talk to me when i left work i walked past 2xs car and we gave each other a smile and wave which is normal i tend to wave goodbye to most staff at the end of the day but now im thinking about whether it means something different now rather than just being friendly so thats kind of the main spiel theres probably a good chunk of contextual information that i may have forgotten at the time of writing that i may later remember but the main point i made this for is what do i do i would love to make this work and see if were compatible as people but am desperately scared to ruin it as a chance to be happy,post-pandemic
today is my birthday and so far the only person thats said happy birthday to me has been my ex wife when i called to video chat with my daughter 25yo no one at work knew it was my birthday no one in the little town im in knows its my birthday and i basically dont have any friends pretty lonely day edit wow this is more than a bit overwhelming back at work the next day after going to bed extremely early in fact not long after taking this post i really hadnt expected this much response thank you thank you all i appreciate it more than you could know side note if anyone is in oklahoma and wants to talk im almost always available,pre-pandemic

really fucking tragic i wish i could go back to 10 years ago its just not the right path,pre-pandemic
really wish i could have given this any other flair but i am not doing well i have a big problem with both violence and inaction that i am not sure how to deal with i have suffered such intense moral injury from inaction that there was a point in my life where i swung waaaay too hard in the direction of vigilance it almost always ended up in people being physically hurt as well as confused as to why that hurt me in the other direction and now im neurotic in the direction of inaction all over again i feel like i have no other responses than retreat inward or go berserk ive gone over a decade without incident but there is a certain brand of disrespect that really makes me fear both for my response as well as the others physical safety i dont know how to navigate this i go far out of my way to set boundaries and let people know its not a joke and it seems like they take that communication as a sign that things are good enough that they can be totally casual about it i understand a lot of people respond this way when you give them everything up front but when i give the playbyplay commentary and things dont change i feel like im being actively disrespected in ways that make me physically ill i honestly dont know what to do it always seems as a rule you cant complain in a new situation off the first incident without outgrouping yourself it feels like i dont even notice until its too late and then i am i spying every little red flag i noticed on first encounter by memory but didnt have an urgent feeling about in this case the roommate who did the interview finding out i had a rent supplement and asking what my disability was in case it effects the house that shit is crazy and crazyunethical i could go on forever about that entitlement its really hard to even type out or think about but i feel so useless in nondangerous scenarios for a little while i considered what it might be like to just go get a job where people seem to get ptsd anyway like military or emergency room stuff i know i would be effective at least shortterm while the demons piled up but im way beyond that i would look like seth rogan taking his psych exam in observe and report probably the best hollywood depiction of a real mental illness without degrading the character i would say there is just no way any gatekeeper is going to by choice put someone with so much history in a position of responsibility so here i am in a new place shared house virtually choking from dehydration because i am afraid i might run into the person that is causing me problems after having repeated incidents for about a week little while ago he sold the only piece of furniture in my room online only told me when he needed help moving it im paying for this i am paying a thousand dollars a month to hide in a room and watch my personal projects i am working on monetizing go to waste it just makes no sense to me but if i dont try if i have nothing to work on things get bad so fast,post-pandemic
so ive been in a manic stage for a few days now and i bought a domain name a book a planner dry erase markers that i actually did need and went thrift shopping and got a bunch of clothes on the bright side my job offered me to hire me back and im going to find out if they can work around my schedule because i have anxiety bipolar ptsd and panic attacks so heres hoping things go well im going to be the best employee ever but i need to ensure that my schedule is locked down if they cant offer me that i will look elsewhere i wont be bullied again in retail because it takes a toll on my mental health,pre-pandemic
one of the main side effects thats hard to deal with is hunger you will be craving carbs like no other i gained about 20 pounds then decided to try something i switched to a no carb keto bread is actually very good suggest honey loafs all vegetarian diet so basically i would eat very filling huge salads for lunch and dinner after a few days my craving for carbs went down by about 90 you might say theres no way i could go all vege no carb diet but after you experience the carb hunger from zyprexa you may give it a try,post-pandemic
i got diagnosed with adhd in 2nd grade and quit taking meds around 6th we tried both ritalin and concerta i am a sophomore now i have a job that i have only been late to 2 times and i am an a b student i also help with special olympics my dad also has adhd and freshman year let me take some of his ritalin for a bit to see if it would help with school but it made me anxious i think it was a higher dose i did notice i was more sociable however i do struggle with hyper fixations however like if i get into an argument with someone a lot of the time i feel like getting the last word in i also have a skincare obsession according to my parents lol they say im bougie and a room decoration one as of recent and i did struggle to get over my recent breakup but there are other reasons than adhd when it came to that i quit taking them initially because it made me feel like a zombie and i feel like everything lost its sparkcolor not in a depressed way but like boredom i do wonder if hoping back on my anxietydepression would help as i have been struggling to stay on top of those since i am busy i really think they only thing that would benefit from meds atm would be my school work as i also struggle with procrastinating things not so much cleaning and stuff like that but specifically school work i just hear on this sub how much meds have helped them and i wonder if i need mine too part of me is kinda scared though as i dont wanna feel that way again not eating and feeling colorless,post-pandemic

im a year clean from sniffing and lately ive been freaking myself out because ive been getting nosebleeds every day for the past week i did recently move from a hot and humid climate to a cole and dry climate so it could be that but my nosebleeds have been happening from my primary nostril that i would sniff through i have been to the doctor previously and found out i have holes in my nasal cavity but ive heard of the effects of sniffing catching up to people even after they stop sniffing should i be worried has this happened to anyone else im considering going to the doctor for it but im worried itll be written off as just the weather having an effect on my nose,post-pandemic
one way i have been coping with my adhd is by looking at my genetic make up from an evolutionary approach yes reddit evolution i think reddit likes evolution thom hartmann proposes the huntergather hypothesis in which i ascribe too i am still learning more about this theory but i enjoy it majority if not all humans were once huntergathers food was obtained from hunting as well as farming so you had the farmers and the hunters now if you have adhd and you were transplanted back in time what job would you choose my money is on the hunter the racing mind looking for the next big kill chances are i have retained some of these characteristics from my ancestors as society evolved these adhd characteristics did not always fit it i agree with this view as to why adhders do not like the mundane and cant stay focused on the boring however can hyper focus on the interesting and stimulating i think this also explains adhders and their distorted sense of time impatience and impulsiveness this outlook has helped me a great deal hopefully it can help you too i am not a great writer and aware i may have made some grammatical mistakes,pre-pandemic
i want to talk with my practitioner about both my primary physical health issues and health anxiety issues that have manifested into physical health issues however i seem to get really flustered when they ask for symptoms and only list out a few because i tell myself oh it is probably just anxiety they dont need to know about my health anxiety and i do not want to waste their time but once i leave the appointment my anxiety kicks back in and goes wait what if my health anxiety symptoms is actually my primary health issue and i might get misdiagnosed for withholding info x200b i am basically asking how do i not be anxious in telling the whole story,post-pandemic

i am in my 30s my mother is in her 60s and i strongly believe she has undiagnoseduntreated adhd her symptomsbehaviors are impacting my relationship with her some of her symptoms include excessive talking when around her every silence is filled with talking hyperfixation on certain topics she could talk endlessly and in minute detail about a topic that shes interested in but when others mention theyre not interested in these topics she continues to bring them up distractibilityjumping from one thought to another overthetop responses to being excited shrieking falling onto the floor losingmisplacing items imo these symptoms have intensified since she started living alone several years ago while shes always been upbeat and excitable her current behaviors do not seem in line with adults her age i feel exhausted and overstimulated when interacting with her and often embarrassed by her behavior she has been taking the same antidepressant for decades she has been in therapy but is not currently the hard part for me is how to bring up my concerns she is extremely sensitive to judgmentcriticism she has few hobbies or social interactions with other adults outside of work while i know thats not my responsibility i often feel like my siblings and i are all she has so i feel guilty upsetting her she knows she has things to work on but also chalks her personality up to being wacky her words any suggestions on the following how to compassionately voice my concerns how to encourage her to seek help any coping strategies that i can use when im around her,post-pandemic

when the twelve steps dont work for you twelve steppers respond by saying its your fault you are too dishonest you are too lazy you are too arrogant headstrong actually the twelve steps just arent the answer for many people with addictions so maybe stop being a presumptuous dick let go of this belief that the twelve steps work for everyone unless theyre a lazy nogood arrogant liar its a bullshit belief and its offensive when the twelve steps dont work for you and you find something else that does work twelve steppers respond by saying you were never a real addict real addicts can only get sober through the twelve steps real addicts cant get sober any other way now recently ive heard twelve steppers try to claim that they dont actually believe that the twelve steps are the only way to recover the na basic text tells a different story we sought help and found none often doctors didnt understand our dilemma they tried to help by giving us medication our husbands wives and loved ones gave us what they had and drained themselves in the hope that we would stop using or would get better we tried substituting one drug for another but this only prolonged our pain we tried limiting our using to social amounts without success there is no such thing as a social addict some of us sought an answer through churches religions or cultism some sought a cure by geographic change we blamed our surroundings and living situations for our problems this attempt to cure our problems by moving gave us a chance to take advantage of new people some of us sought approval through sex or change of friends this approvalseeking behaviour carried us further into our addiction some of us tried marriage divorce or desertion regardless of what we tried we could not escape from our disease whats the takehome message here apart from the twelve steps nothing can help you we sought help and found none doctors cant help you doctors dont understand your dilemma medication cant help you your friends family will drain themselves in vain trying to help you switching drugs wont help you you have no hope of moderating other churchesreligionscults besides the twelve steps cannot help you moving cannot help you nothing can help you regardless of what we tried we could not escape from our disease this is the impression you get at twelve step meetings without these meetings youre fucked this is a lie feel free to stop going to meetings no one needs them unless theyre brainwashed into believing they need them so what happens when somebody with an addiction does find something that helps them from outside of the twelve step religion twelve steppers feel the need to neutralize the threat to their religious beliefs instead of accepting that some people with addictions can be understood helped by doctors by medication by moving by switching to marijuana by learning how to use lessthey protect their false belief by denying your experience of addiction you were never a real addict its fucked up its not right and it needs to change,pre-pandemic
ive never felt so defeated ever since i entered college one of the things that has been an obstacle throughout my life is my social anxiety it started off with me being shy but through the years it turned to anxiety its gotten so bad to the point where i met with my advisor 2 times out of the 4 years of being there when its supposed to be seven and just because of that i have to do another year its not only my advisor but its the professor as well i barely go to them for help and it also caused me to fail classes do i even have a reason for living how am i going to do my job properly if im so afraid to talk to people i tried exposure therapy all throughout high school i picked a job that required me to be social i played football i became friends with an extrovert and after all that it made my anxiety 10 times worse its because of those experiences that makes me feel anxious so why should i continue you know what i learned throughout all those experiences i realize that i dont have what it takes to be a normal functioning person in society i have a terrible speech impediment which has gotten progressively worse throughout the years multiple people have called me out on it im not very smart when making decisions my best friend is constantly looking after me cause of the stupid things i say and do and on top of that i might be on the spectrum of autism or aspergers im really not trying to come off as pessimistic im just looking at the logistics of my situation the major i picked requires high communication skills which i dont have it would be very problematic because its in the medical field i need some guidance on how to live life with the problems that i have its debilitating going through this,post-pandemic

if you have goodnatured adhd kids you may find that unmedicated homeschooling is a better fit than a traditional classroom 1 my kids can talk to themselves and move around while they work it doesnt bother anyone so its not a problem 2 my kids can spend hours outside running and playing and daydreaming 3 my kids produce stacks of doodles every day 4 my kids are ahead of school kids because they can finish k3 level work in less than an hour a day we do year round schooling for a predictable routine 5 if my kids ask an off topic question about something cool we go and find the answer none of this now is not the time ask me tomorrow when tomorrow never comes crud bascially if your adhd kids dont have other issues homeschooling removes the parts of the classroom that make adhd unbearable and lets your children mature at their own rate we still practice sitting still and not interrupting but we dont tie it to academics so learning doesnt suffer because of adhd,pre-pandemic

they say once an addict always an addict its true that its part of you but doesnt define what your truth is hi my name is bliss and i was addicted to heroin for 5 years and suboxone for the following 2 years and that is non stop daily use i was not sober a single day for 7 years straight short snysopsis of my history when i was 21 years old i moved far away from home met a bad boy felon who i married within 3 months started using heroin with my husband daily for 5 years the relationship was abusive and he had a lot of psychological and health prpblems i lived in tons of shitty places and had tons of jobs that i got fired for either stealing or my drug use i was pregnant 3 times and used through them because i didnt know or didnt care this resulted in 2 miscarriages and 1 preterm son i gave birth to who lived to be a month old before he passed away from sepsis after 5 years we moved back to my parents across the country and within 3 months my husband was out drinking at a buddies house and was playing around with a shotgun played his favorite game of russian roulette but this time when he pulled the trigger he shot himself in the head was pronounced brain dead and died 3 days later i am only putting this out there because a it feels good to talk about it since i do not have many people who know this about me b to let you know that all humans suffer in some way or form and even though this can be seen as traumatic i am still alive i have been sober for 25 years i know it doesnt matter what others say about recovery it doesnt matter to an addicts mind i remember thinking yeah you got sober but you dont know me i just cant do it many think they cant that they are different and their struggles are different the thing is addiction also makes you entitled believing the universe revolves around you and when you suffer the world will come to an end until you feel better this is the problem of thought and once someone feels entitled they feel their way is right that they are the center of the universe its not just addicts that think like this its much of society however we need to suffer we need to feel pain to feel bad to be able to turn it into something we learn from and something we grow from we must try to put the long term high above the short term one when you stub your toe for the first time you feel pain so you know not to go around kicking tables or walk into things you learn and thats a beautiful thing about existence now that i am sober i can feel and smell and see clearly and even though its not all roses it doesnt matter because thats just part of the human existence anyway sans addiction i have had a new wonderful partner for 4 years a great salary job and have positive meaningful friendships none of them care about my past that i was a junkie who put myself through hell and could not be trusted by anyone close to me so i just leave my past there thats the wonderful thing about it it can stay there and you do not have to live it anymore you can find support offered everywhere but the only support that gives you an answer is the one from yourself its a frightening scary step to take but you have to fight against gravity holding you down you just need to pick up one foot and step forward then the next and over time you will be running you will be light humans are amazing creatures just suprise yourself,pre-pandemic
i had someone offer to mentor me on something that i have been dying to accomplish for over a decade hes talented and where i want to be and he was giving me a steal on the price too i kept fucking up i kept making excuses doing work at the last minute like always and putting things off he gave me two warnings just now he told me it wasnt fair to keep doing this to him and that he was fair with me and gave me a huge opportunity that i fucked up im so fucking angry at myself and sick of being this way its not fair ive been to therapists taken different medications and tried and tried and i cant break out of these fucking goddamned habits and now its bitten me in the ass this was the opportunity of a fucking lifetime i havent been so disappointed in myself in a long time,pre-pandemic
a little while ago i wrote this up to try and explain how i feel taking seroquel all these drugs rattle around in our brains differently but maybe someone can relate to how this one lives in me backstory i take it every night at 830 and this day i had to take it late and wake up early seroquel is an angry beast with sharp claws the 830 pm pill routine is to keep a nice schedule for bipolar happiness and make it possible to wake up but seroquel doesnt just make me tired at night and make it hard to wake up in the morning it is wreaking havoc in me that i need to be asleep to get through i dont get tired at night like you get tired i cant just stay awake instead of feeling tired i feel my body shut down even if i say conscious i feel like every system is stopping anyway whatever processes are necessary to keep me alive are all rebooting thats why youve probably heard me talk angry or in short sentences at night internally im fighting to communicate with whatever resources are left the push down to sleep is important seroquel does a strong push down followed by a big kick up if im still awake for the up kick things get bad i have the seizure like movements i have to move some part of my body my legs my arms my head into a pillow not moving is painful i have to move and i get anxious and confused the nights ive run into this without then taking sleep meds are some of the worst nights ive had it feels like ive been awake for days but something is stopping me from sleeping theres a door that wont open my brain would stop buzzing and my body would stop hurting if i could go through the door but i just cant i guess seroquel really is all about resources if i skip a day the night is ok but the next day is bad its like blood stops circulating through my brain i have all day to use the same allotment of blood that is usually refreshed every few heart beats so the longer the day goes the ratio of oxygen to waste in the blood is declining and thinking gets harder and harder and slower missing seroquel feels like all the bones were taken out of your body not that you cant physically operate but that there is a hole inside of you that goes through every part of you waking up early today isnt about waking up drinking coffee and doing some jumping jacks wont change anything seroquel doesnt let you wake up until your body has had enough time to get it out of your blood if it is still in there then you are not capable of functioning it doesnt matter how much i want to i cant today it felt like there was a wall in my brain i couldnt move through in the shower it felt like somehow i could feel every cell in my brain and they were all trying to turn in circles like each part of my brain was having a seizure it hurt i know you cant feel your brain there are no nerves in there but seroquel makes you think you feel all kinds of sensations up there most of them bad psych meds are strange theyre nothing like alcohol or benadryl or cold meds or opiates or pot or anything im missing those all feel like youre on something you are still you you are just on something something fun or sleepy or strange not psych meds they change you they are inside you they regulate how you feel what you think you are who you are you nothing like anything else seroquel is the worst psych med i have ever taken with the right precautions it is the most helpful med ever but the side effects are horrible and the amount of effort and planning and vigilance needed to work around the angry claws is crazy i hate the 830 alarm but the 830 alarm keeps me going,pre-pandemic
hey guys my psych rx me straterra which didnt work for me so he put me on concerta 18mg 1x a day ive been on it for about 23 weeks now how do i know its working for me i work a full time job and study after work and on the weekends to prep for a grad school entrance exam but i feel like im still struggling so much with studying how do i know if its just me being lazy and not wanting to learn boring content vs adhd im on my phone right now and i have no trouble going on social media and directing my attention to that but im struggling with maintaining my attention so much with studying my mind starts to drift or i go on my phone i also struggle with basic tasks like feeding myself or remembering to eat in general ive tried taking 2x18mg as well and i think that has helped a little i dont really know how to gauge if it is or not,post-pandemic

i dont know what to say or do i just feel like my life is falling apart three weeks ago my apartment was broken into by 4 strangers my girlfriend was sleeping over it was an awful horrific long night and she witnessed every single thing 8 hours of prolonged humiliation and abuse these 4 strangers destroyed me they shredded every bit of selfesteem and sanity i had after the hell they put me through they simply left me there bleeding heavily and stunned my girlfriend was tied up screaming but i didnt move it took me a while to comprehend that this is now my reality and eventually get up weeks later i am paranoid unable to look at my reflection without feeling disgust and i spend my time in my university lectures thinking about ending my life i didnt tell a single soul about this because i feel so ashamed i feel pathetic and weak my girlfriend is the only one that knows though everyone around has been telling me ive been ignoring them lately and calling me an asshole for it yet i dont care i just feel numb i want to die but im too afraid to say it out loud that night they not only violently violated me but they took something from me a piece of my soul anyways ever since that night my girlfriend has been acting different she treats me differently touches me differently and most importantly she looks at me differently a few days ago while we were sitting together she told me that its alright if this experience turns me gay and that we dont have to continue dating this is coming from a 19 year old girl that has common sense it all just made me feel really bad it just reflected how after all this how disgusting i feel was valid that i am gross in her eyes now today is my birthday i turn 20 i bailed on all the plans and decided to spend it alone im sitting at home drinking alcohol and thinking about bashing my goddamn face in i just feel alone in a way i never felt before i just never thought this is where id be that this would be my life i hope im posting this in the correct place ive only had reddit when i was younger thanks for listening for whoever is out there hopefully ill feel better for writing this update 1 two of the assailants were caught by the police today ill post a more detailed update in the next few days thank you everyone for this support update 2 sorry im late with this ive just been going through a lot im gonna try to give everyone a bit of closure on everything thats went down the four assailants were part of a sex trafficking gang that my shitty dad got involved with and owed a lot of money im not comfortable sharing the details of this specific aspect but i hope this general explanation is enough two of them were caught and will be most likely going to prison as they plead guilty to avoid a trial im currently trying to get myself together but things have been getting worse and worse mentally ive been going to gym jogging and trying my best to not lose it i didnt start therapy but im considering it me and my girlfriend broke up and theres no bad blood i just need to focus on myself and again thank you everyone for the immense support youve given me you have no idea how much it saved me and made me feel a little less alone thank you,pre-pandemic

okay so basically i 22f have had anxiety for as long as i can remember when i was as young as 4 years old i feared what other people thought about me whenever i was with my family mom dad and 2 older brothers and they would all laugh at something i said i would instantly get upset out of fear that they were laughing at me they would always call my reactions dramatic and this made me believe that they were judging me even more my mom has also told me many times that as a baby i couldnt sleep without her holding me as soon as she would put me in my crib i would start crying maybe some kind of separation anxiety i was also very shy when meeting new people especially adults or just anyone who was much older than me in general ive been called dramatic over emotional and sensitive my whole life but i cant even name a reason for it i cant recall ever having a traumatic life experience or anything as a kid i definitely had a lot of emotional outbursts when i thought other people were criticising me or when i failed at something and i always feared failure as well as an adult i generally always fear that other people judge me or dont like me and it can make social situations pretty stressful i still also fear failure but ive been trying to work on that and i dont think its as bad as it used to be im curious what other people might think of this i was never diagnosed as a child and my parents just always assumed it was part of my personality,post-pandemic

not today not yesterday 9 years ago no one knows no one noticed i took a bunch of pills out of various bottles my family had lying around adderal percocet sleeping pills and allergy meds were among them i dont know what else there were more than four bottles it was just whatever i could find i swallowed some of each chasing them with a wine cooler let a few dissolve on my tongue because i liked the sickening feeling they induced i thought that would be enough after a few minutes of nothing happening i swallowed more got dizzy struggled to make it to the couch passed out i was passed out in the living room and my family didnt notice they walked by me and didnt notice i still remember it all vividly and think of it often i had no regrets i wanted to die waking up realizing i was still alive that was the worst feeling ive ever felt it put me in a daze ive felt on pause ever since i often regret not dying i feel like i should be dead i feel like a large part of me did die that day the only reason i didnt immediately try again was fear of not fully dying i knew i couldnt go through that again and didnt have other resources i felt were adequate i dropped out of school shortly after i stopped leaving my house i see all these stories of people living and being ecstatic over it i dont have that life hasnt gotten better i just wanted to tell someone,pre-pandemic
i tried for so many years to stop drinking a bottle or 2 of wine most every night i made excuses about my habitit was a way to relax something to do when i watched tv it made me funnier wittier more creative i knew thoughi knew it was unhealthy my sleep suffered my work suffered my motivation to do anything but drink wine suffered i just decided one day not to get a bottle then again the next day i had to will myself to avoid the aisle at the store and many times i turned around 2 or 3 times i must have looked crazy but i did it 60 damn days im so proud of myself go me,pre-pandemic

man the emotional dysregulation can be so exhausting some days child started concerta the other day and his psych np said he could become more emotional i told her i dont think thats even possible we were reading about angler fish earlier and he is absolutely enraged and upset by the fact that male angler fish are smaller than females and basically melt into them and im 99 sure this isnt even related to meds he has been like this for years any thoughts on getting him off of this anger and to stop fixating on things,post-pandemic
the title pretty much sums it up if therapy helped you overcome sa or at least make good progress with it was there a certain exercise or point made by your therapist that really made an impact ive been to therapy 3 times once when i was around 13 i felt very uncomfortable and had a panic attack as soon as i left and never went back lol the second time i was 1617 and the therapist acted more like she was trying to be my life coach or something rather than actually focusing on my social anxiety and again when i was 18 but i went to a therapist who mostly worked with children and it all felt a bit childish every therapist ive been to doesnt seem to think much is wrong with me but i think thats because in that setting i feel comfortable speaking because i know what im there for and ultimately they have to ask all the questions so it makes them think that im okay when im not,post-pandemic
societal expectations are a major contributor to your unhappiness you are bombarded by advertisements and social media that tell you you need this or that in order to be happy you feel like something is wrong with you that you failed natural selection so what if thats truly the case then theres nothing you can do about that and wallowing about it in self pity only hurts yourself either you know you can do better for yourself by you own standards and should use your dissatisfaction as a motivator or you should take the time you truly ask yourself what is wrong with my body where is the feeling of wrongness in my physical form most of the things you come up with are going to be judgments which are an artifact and societal construct my body is bad because it is fat bad is your judgment your body is what it is let go of judgment,post-pandemic
whenever i go in a class even when its online i just feel like the atmosphere changes for me and everything just becomes hyperfocused to the point where i feel tired already after 15 minutes of being in class i just think about every little thing thats going on in the class what the other student is doing what they look like what i potentially look like to students what every students mannerism is what quality of mic do the students have like i dont know is it justifiable for me to not attend my online courses because of this,post-pandemic

i had already taken another pill earlier but for some reason it wore off much earlier than usual and i still have a lot of work to do so i just decided to take another one i usually take it in the morning and it always wears off in time for me to sleep but this time i dont know what to expect tldr took 30 mg vyvanse at 6pm should i try and sleep tonight or just pull an all nighter studying edit to be completely honest i am not really feeling any of the effects of the medication right now at 8pm besides the fact that my legs are sort of jittery which is a symptom that i always have even well after the medication is done working this sucks though because i wasted a pill expecting to be able to study all night and i still dont have the motivation to start my test isnt until wednesday but i just wanted to finish one work sheet we were assigned but i just dont feel like its worth it for me to even try to do it if my vyvanse isnt working because it will probably work tomorrow and then i will be able to do the worksheet and be super interested in it and motivated,pre-pandemic

ive never been really fond of valentines day i always brushed off the day because i always knew that i wouldnt have anyone to celebrate it with or that i was busy it didnt seem significant to me until for some reason it seamed like i was missing out of course being valentines day a lot of friends and peers had plans with a significant other like always i just ignored it i went home and after one hectic week of exams everything seemed to slow down i had an entire week to take a break and i just didnt know what to do with those days shortly after a few friends asked me to take a walk at the park so i stepped out of our dorm and go along weirdly everything around me seemed more colorful than usual almost felt like everything was smiling from ear to ear initially i thought that it was just myself feeling happy besides it is that day of the year again but besides myself being happy i felt like i was missing something like i know that im happy but im not content something like that idk i cant really describe it well when we arrived at the park it was nearing the evening so lights everywhere was lit up especially with the love theme of the day then we came across in the park a band performing turns out there was a public concert there sponsored by the city i first thought of it as cool as i dont get to see free concerts in the park very often but its that one song that they played that i somehow gave me this feeling of revelation the band played cold coffee by ed sheeran if anyones asking lovely song if i say so myself while my friends went off somewhere else in the park i just stood there among the crowd watching the band and listening to the music i dont know why i felt a strong feeling of despair in that song ive never really given thought in getting into a relationship with someone until this one moment i dont know why im only feeling this sense of loneliness in this specific day but it kinda sucks i never realised the value of holiday until now i almost got teary eyed just listening to the song i said to myself it would be nice to have someone to sing this for for the rest of the night i felt very distant from the rest of my friends not only because i know that they have their sos with them but also seeing the fun things they do together being the only single guy among them i wouldnt say that im jealous about it no i wouldnt allow myself to feel such things especially with the topic of love and relationships but it felt like i was kinda left out like i was missing something not seeing something they see i really didnt want to share this here i wouldve preferred to share this with a close friend of mine but hes not available at the moment so i guess this is the next best thing i just felt like i needed to let this out somewhere you know its been a while since i felt this low heres to another year again for being single cheers,post-pandemic

i would like to preface this with mentioning in my 8 hospitalizations from 20192021 ive been slapped with bipolar 2 so thats facts but 4 times ive gotten the bonus of schizo affective or schizoid and have never gotten proper info on that and i dont always understand the research results i have been through psychosis many times and have experienced a complete violent meltdown with a housing manager in 2020 and heard a voice telling me to do things so so ive always slept with fans on or the tv so the sound machine to me is no different sonically for sleeping ive never ever noticed this with any other thing but a few months after we started using my gfs sound machine i started to notice i hear orchestral music or repetitive song like phrases of no actual meaning and none of this is stuff that exists like its straight up not real songs this has been every fucking night for over 2 years now or any time the sound machine is on and it goes and goes until i fall asleep so my question is with the preface and that knowledge combined does this sound like a result of my mental health disorders or is this bullshit and seemingly unrelated,post-pandemic

its like i know im being melodramatic i know im not being rational i know im not making good decisions but theres like a naughty part of me who wants to drink and drug her feelings away and scream at the people she loves because shes 999 that everyone hates her and then begging for them to come back i think the worst part is when i let that part of me take over though when i get tired of fighting off crazy irrational thoughts and finally just give in i let anxiety anger depression and loneliness take hold and corrupt my thinking to the point that i can think of nothing else if they ever find some magical pill to make this shit go away hmu,pre-pandemic

day like18 or 19 ive lost count of being in the medical 2 major surgeries hospital you all first of all have been my main support system to get through this hard time having bipolar and going through these trying times of pain and loneliness today my nurse took me outside the hospital in a wheelchair to the water fountain she bought me some starbucks coffee we sat together and chatted about uplifting things she didnt know i was having a bad day i had already cried like three times before then i felt hopeless i felt a mood swing coming on im on an antibiotic currently that makes latuda less effective but her act of kindness completely turned around my day im ever so grateful to her and it was a busy day here too with like 17 more surgeries coming in yet she made the time for me i want to thank all medical staff for those extra things you do for your patients you might have no idea what theyre going through and one small act of kindness might change everything i just wanted to share a good thing that happened,pre-pandemic
i feel like these situations are where my bpd really shines lol im crazy obsessive ill get a look from a guy and im already planning our hypothetical future together ill talk to someone for 3 consistent days and my mood starts to revolve solely around our interactions if its longer than a week ive already gone through every social media platform available a million times and tried to learn every bit of information i can to cater my personality to what they seem to like i feel terrible about it but ill convince myself its a necessary thing to do each time ive made myself sick with anxiety to the point i cant eat when i go too long without hearing back from them i like to think im pretty good with masking these traits and not imposing my anxieties on the guys i talk to but one way or another things always fail and im left feeling completely worthless and unloveable until i snap out of it and then i hate them and then i move onto the next lmao ive never had a proper relationship and im going on 22 its especially complicated for me because im gay and i often dont feel confident in safely interacting with other men outside of the internet nothing develops naturally for me and even if it did id likely burn it to flames pretty quick im terrified ill always be like this i dont know how to love in a healthy way i feel things so deeply specifically when it comes to romantic attraction and that applies to a deep feeling with every emotion positive and very negative i can be very intense and i feel terrible about it this is becoming a vent post but really im looking for some success stories or advice from those who experience this level of struggle with relationships,post-pandemic

im so tired like not physically just deep in my soul im tired of existing i dont necessarily want to kill myself but sometimes i desperately wish to just not be im tired of needing meds to be 70 functioning and without them i barely even function at 30 it would be fine if i could go back to being ignorant and just believing im ditsy or lazy i actually crave to be able to self loathe for reasons of believing i am inadequate because now i just am just forced to watch all my potential wasted and be utterly powerless to do anything the self awareness the diagnosis brought did nothing but make me painfully aware of all the things adhd ruins in my life i am at the point where i no longer try anything new because i know i will fail im tired of relying on meds that make my heart race make me depressed crash and take away my personality but without the meds im a mess that will eat herself to death im tired of isolating myself because i cant sustain friendships im tired of battling to keep my spaces neat and tidy because i cannot cope if my surroundings are as chaotic as i am i feel so alone adhd is truly an awful thing to be able to watch your life go by but never really be present im 32f i was miserable before meds and diagnosis and im still just as miserable now 2 years later ive been in therapy now for about 2 years but i make no progressbecause the adhd is so severe how can you use coping mechanisms if you fail to remember they even exist when you need them the world wants us to run the same marathon as everyone elseexcept with our feet tied together ive genuinely lost hope,post-pandemic
so at the beginning of this week i was diagnosed with and started treatment for fairly severe adult adhd 10mg of dexedrine a day ramping up to 20mg next week then levelling off this was basically confirming something i was diagnosed with as a child and had known about for a long time but hadnt dealt with in any meaningful way i am in my final year of university in london studying for a ba in english lit yes what can you do with a ba in english is my theme song and spent my second year on exchange to uc santa cruz in california i didnt do very well in my first year at uni got depressed and behind had trouble completing work on time concentrating etc i was getting 1sts and high 21s the equivalent to an american universitys a or a on all work i actually handed in its just that i wasnt handing in very much work i had previously done very well at school prior to higher education in spite of concentration problems other learning difficulties bullying and the like so not doing well academically was a huge blow i ended up having to do everything that was overdue all at once at the last minute a situation thats repeated this year to a certain extent although now that im in treatment and working again it seems we caught it in time the reason i mentioned ucsc was because while i was there i had access to both some of the best weed in the world at good prices from reliable dealers and dispensaries and my flatmates supply of adderal for when i needed to write a paper id been smoking for three or four years by this point and generally found it took the edge off my world experience made me feel calmer and weirdly less paranoid i did extremely well academically got straight as without trying particularly hard was happy and generally flourished in that environment i was planning to apply to a phd program when i got back to the uk fast forward a year and id been intellectually paralysed more or less since getting back from california had done barely any work for several months was depressed and nearsuicidal over my workload and the possibility of failing my degree at the final hurdle it looked like my life was going to take a dramatic turn for the worse my partner effectively forced me to confront the issue rather than just hiding from it and ive now got both a diagnosis and the medication to treat my condition honestly its like having my mind back after a year i can concentrate im not paranoid and on edge the entire time im calm focused and able to work for the first time in months im no longer failing my degree and have done more work in the last three days than i had in the rest of the academic year turns out id been effectively treating the social side of the adhd constantly being onedge paranoia some hyperactivity talking too much butting in and finishing other peoples sentences etc with weed for the year i was in california and earlier as well and had obviously used my flatmates adhd medication for its intended purpose as and when i needed when i got back to the uk and didnt have regular access or none at all for the adderal to either of those things which kept me level and working i fell apart now that im on medication im doing so much better its almost unbelievable i wanted to share my story and i had a question for you guys as well what are your opinions on the use of marijuana for adhoc or where legal prescribed treatment of some of the symptoms of adhdadd is it even able to be prescribed for the condition in us states where there are medical marijuana laws im curious because it seemed to genuinely help me in social terms and id rather not be permanently on large doses of dexedrine or other fairly powerful amphetamines constantly although obviously will be taking them regularly enough to keep my dopamine levels up for the rest of my life tldr i used weed to treat social symptoms of my nowdiagnosed adult adhd and my flatmates adderal last year for academic work fell apart academically this year at uni due to not having either of those and a lack of actual treatment but now have meds and am doing well what are your opinions on its use as treatment for the social symptoms in situations where concentration is not required for work as well as an occasional replacement for the calming effects of amphetaminebased treatment when fluctuating dosage downwards ps for the benefit of the mods can i say that im not advocating marijuana as a replacement for actually treating adhdadd and obviously know its illegal in most of the world including where i live but i wanted to share my experience and do have a genuine question about peoples experiences with and opinions on its use as a complement to medication and whether it can be prescribed in us states which have medical marijuana laws peace out,pre-pandemic

last night i got pretty drunk after work because i had gotten my period and was in an awful mood for an assortment of reasons those of which i am about to pop off on first the night before i had stayed up a fat minute waiting for my housemate to come home and she never did no warning or nothing which she has never done before she was at a friends place so i didnt text but it still sucked because usually we communicate when were going to be home and when we wont be that same day i found every old picture of my ex and i that i thought i deleted 4 years ago yeah that was a bit fucking surprise alright next day yesterday wake up with absolutely awful period pains and in an awful mood i still had to go to work which was just a lot on top of everything else and then again last night i still had not gotten a single text from her about whats going on i know that shes an adult and doesnt have to tell me but i thought it was common decency to let your housemates know if you arent coming home for the night so they can lock the door accordingly and what not that whole relationship has been feeling so one sided recently which makes me so sad because she and my other housemate are all i have and to feel so unloved like i did the other night was just absolutely crushing anyways it all just got to me all at once and i sent her a pretty long text about it then passed out cause i was drunk lol woke up this morning to a long ass text back and now i am feeling super self destructive bc i said anything in the first place all i can think about is cutting to make my wrongs right and just going fucking ham on my arms despite being clean for a year and a half why cant i just let these things go i just dont wanna care about anyone so i dont feel these awful urges to cut myself every time i do something even slightly wrong,post-pandemic

i have a younger coworker who has been feeling self conscious about her weight lately shes well above average regarding looks so its a bit upsetting to me actually after hearing that she wanted to loose weight my friend also a coworker started making some really insensitive comments she was straight up calling our coworker fat and criticizing her for eating after she made my coworker cry i got angry and then she said something again and i fucking snapped i told her that she was being incredibly cruel for no reason she asked why everyone was in such a shitty mood and couldnt take a joke and i replied that she was putting us in a shitty mood by being a bitch now this may seem like a pretty benign thing but you have to understand that i am a coward i have never stood up for anyone other then meekly asking to change the topic im still shaking and this was over 3 hours ago i think i lost a friend today im damn happy about it because how dare she though seriously good riddance she was pissed off and for the first time in my life i dont care that someone is mad at me im pretty proud of that edit oh my god thank you so much for all of the niceness ive been feeling pretty shitty the past few days so it really brightened my week,pre-pandemic

i often feel as if im unable to express my emotions simply because others perceive me as attractive and whenever i attempt to share this overwhelming sense of loneliness im confronted with accusations of seeking attention or being told that i have no right to complain because im handsome this places me in a weird position where despite experiencing profound loneliness im seemingly disqualified from feeling so because im presumed to have it easy,post-pandemic
it has taken me till 26 to notice that there is a horrible cycle in my life propelled by both conditions im an artist and i was wondering why i would repeatedly have bursts of inspo and motivation then suddenly it becomes hard to draw a single line even worse is when i would push through that art block and then land myself in a situation where i cant even pick up a pen for a year but i then also noticed that that same cycle happens to me with my nonhobby related things like i would have periods where i obsess over making sure i had and kept a job and then taking care of everyone else in my life before me i would complete tasks in a flurry and neglect myself severely only to then completely crash and burn losing my job and just becoming a shut in who cant even function apply that putting too much effort and work into an unreasonably short amount of time then crashing and burning and becoming useless to every area of my life its so hard because its like adhd and a manic episode mix like horribly it leads me to making insanely unmanageable choices and starting all these really cool projects just to drop them and never touch em again i also take on a bunch of commission work then burn out within a month or two and i am out of action for months it doesnt help that im def effected by it to the point it makes every day life challenging so i should be getting help but my family cant really help me so my finances are shot i gather maybe 100 a month and thats with me pulling my hair out from the stress of finding any way to make money idk man im just so tired of being a slave to depression then being mislead and tricked by my mania and hyper focus,post-pandemic

thats usually a pretty reliable indicator that something isnt quite right about your drinking its a question that gets asked a lot on the recovery subreddits so with that in mind i thought id put together a list of selfassessment questions that can help someone who is questioning whether they have a drinking problem to more closely examine the nature of the relationship they have with alcohol the first questionnaire comes from the dsm5 the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders which is the current standard for diagnosing alcohol use disorder this is the modern medical term for a range of problematic drinking behaviour covering both alcohol abuse and alcohol dependence and is a progressive condition with predictable stages that gets worse over time the more and longer someone drinks under the dsm guidelines anyone meeting any two of the 11 criteria during the same 12month period receives a diagnosis of alcohol use disorder the severity of an aud is graded mild moderate or severe nbsp mild the presence of 2 to 3 symptoms moderate the presence of 4 to 5 symptoms severe the presence of 6 or more symptoms nbsp in the past year have you nbsp had times when you ended up drinking more or longer than you intended more than once wanted to cut down or stop drinking or tried to but couldnt spent a lot of time drinking or being sick or getting over the aftereffects experienced craving a strong need or urge to drink found that drinking or being sick from drinking often interfered with taking care of your home or family or caused job troubles or school problems continued to drink even though it was causing trouble with your family or friends given up or cut back on activities that were important or interesting to you or gave you pleasure in order to drink more than once gotten into situations while or after drinking that increased your chances of getting hurt such as driving swimming using machinery walking in a dangerous area or having unsafe sex continued to drink even though it was making you feel depressed or anxious or adding to another health problem or after having had a memory blackout had to drink much more than you once did to get the effect you want or found that your usual number of drinks had much less effect than before found that when the effects of alcohol were wearing off you had withdrawal symptoms such as trouble sleeping shakiness irritability anxiety depression restlessness nausea or sweating or sensed things that were not there nbsp before i stopped drinking i answered yes to every single one of these questions which i wrote about in more detail in this post i dont have an alcohol use disorder any more but i know exactly how i could get one again really quickly the second questionnaire is based on one that appeared in drinking a love story by caroline knapp which i have expanded and added some questions of my own to nbsp do you use alcohol primarily for its moodaltering effects to make yourself feel confident and sociable or less anxious for the euphoric buzz to relax to shut off your thoughts or help you sleep to numb or change difficult feelings like boredom loneliness or emotionalphysical pain or to turn down the dial on sensory inputs etc do you sometimesoftenalways have trouble stopping drinking once youve started do you find that one or two drinks just isnt enough to get the effect youre looking for do you also tend to use other moodaltering substances or processes in a similar way if alcohol isnt available or in combination with alcohol eg nicotine sugar junk food caffeine kratom prescription or recreational drugs shoppingspendinghoarding gambling internetpornsexgaming work exercise bingingpurging selfharm etc are you playing addiction whackamole have you stopped using one or more of the above because it had become problematic only to find that something else popped up in its place is there a history of addictive behavior of one sort or another in your close family are you drinking more frequently or in larger amounts than you used to did you start experimenting with alcohol or other substances at an early age before the age of about 25ish when the brain has finished developing whats your ace score like are you using alcohol to selfmedicate conditions such as anxiety depression loneliness social anxiety or shyness adhd autism bipolar ptsd ocd chronic stress grief etc have you always felt somehow different and found it hard to connect with other people are you drinking to fit in or fill up a sense of inner emptiness do you wonder how other people seem to be able to have a couple of drinks and then stop without a second thought and ask yourself why you cant have you noticed that you seem to drink a lot more than other people around you and have a higher tolerance for alcohol than they do have you ever said something like i dont want to stop drinking altogether i just need to figure out how to control it and learn how to drink like a normal person do you sometimes find yourself drinking when you told yourself you wouldnt have you tried implementing all sorts of rules and schemes to cut down or moderate your drinking like switching brands or types of alcohol promising to only drink on special occasions stopping for a while just to prove that you can etc only to find that it didnt really work for very long and your drinking eventually got out of hand again have you tried every method you can think of to avoid minimize or cure hangovers up to and including the infamous hair of the dog remedy have you spent a lot of time talking to god on the big porcelain telephone after drinking too much or spent days recovering and swearing never to drink again until the next time have you ever lost control of your bladder or bowels due to drinking or peed in strange places conversely has it ever been a point of pride that you never really get hangovers or have you noticed that you dont seem to get hangovers as badly as you used to do you tend to surround yourself with other people who drink like you do does most of your social life revolve around alcohol is drinking closely linked to your hobbies or your job have you ever lied to a doctortherapistpolicemanfriendloved one etc about your drinking or got in trouble with the law because of your drinking duis etc do you find lots of ways to rationalize minimize or justify your drinking well im not that bad i dont drink in the mornings it doesnt really affect me its not affecting anyone else i deserve a drink everybody drinks red wine is good for you the recommended drinking limits are ridiculously low nobody bothers about those i only drink beer its normal to drink like this in college i still manage to get to work every day i need it to steady my nerves im a better version of myself when i drink im not a mean drunk people would think im boring if i didnt drink i cant possibly stop right now not with event involving drinking coming up i just need something to take the edge off soandso drinks more than i do and they seem fine etc etc have you ever hidden alcohol smuggled alcohol in or out of somewhere or had to get creative when disposing of the empties so that others wont see them or found other cunning ways to disguise your consumption from loved ones switching to bagged wine home brewing putting alcohol in a water bottle or coffee cup keeping a nearlyfull decoy bottle on public display while secretly swigging from the one you have stashed in the toilet cistern etc do you rotate the shops where you buy alcohol so that the staff wont judge you or claim that you are stocking up for a party when in fact its all for your own consumption do you only buy enough alcohol at a time to get you through that day because if you bought extra youd drink that as well do you find that sometimes the alcohol you bought wasnt enough and you have to go and find more have you ever felt the need to drink whatever sort of alcohol you could get your hands on if your primary tipple of choice wasnt available or had run out the cooking wine the strange bottle of banana liqueur left over from christmas that noone else wanted the ouzo that someone brought back from holiday the vanilla extract the hand sanitizer the mouthwash etc do you often or usually drink alone do you often drink on an empty stomach in order to feel the effects more

more alcohol now than when you first started to drink do you do a lot of careful arithmetic to work out the best abv price ratio when purchasing alcohol have you switched to cheaper brands or stronger drinks to get the effect youre looking for more economically do you spend a lot of time planning and working out how much you can drink and when or avoid making commitments at times when you know youll be drinkinghungover do you sometimes worry that other people will smell alcohol on you and find various ways to try and cover it up have you convinced yourself yet that vodka doesnt really have a smell have you memorised the licensing hours of every establishment that sells alcohol within a 10mile radius so as not to get caught short without enough booze to get through have you ever been unable to remember part of the previous evening even though your friends say you didnt pass out are these memory blackouts happening more frequently than they used to have you ever lost or damaged important personal possessions while drinking heavily keys wallet phone coat bag shoes car etc or injured yourselfsomeone else or had to go to hospital because of your drinking when drinking with other people do you try to have a few extra drinks when others wont know about it do you pregame by having a few drinks before you go to an occasion involving drinking or drink moderately when out with other people then rush home for a proper drink afterwards have you ever vomited after drinking too much and then continued to drink more known in the trade as the tactical chunder do you sometimes feel uncomfortable if alcohol is not available or avoid activities where you know you wont be able to drink are you in more of a hurry to get your first drink of the day than you used to be does the first one barely touch the sides on the way down when youre not drinking do you spend a lot of time thinking about having your next drink does life seem empty and boring when youre not drinking have you lost interest in other activities you used to enjoy do you sometimes feel a bit guilty or ashamed about your drinking has a family member or close friend expressed concern or complained about your drinking did you continue to drink anyway do you get defensive when people bring up your drinking do you often want to continue drinking after your friends say theyve had enough

you tend to post nonsense on social media or send inappropriate emailstextsmake phone calls while under the influence and then desperately wish the next day that you hadnt or make wildly unsuitable choices in romantic partners due to drinking get into fights become verbally or physically abusive towards other people or do other riskyembarrassingdangerous things that you wouldnt otherwise dream of doing while sober have you ever tried to control your drinking by changing jobs or partners or moving to a new location do you try to avoid contact with family or close friends while you are

it is causing do you find it hard to imagine what your life might be like if you didnt drink do you imagine that life without alcohol must be a boring joyless existence do you spend a lot of time on the internet filling in questionnaires about having a drinking problem and lurking on forums about alcohol addiction nbsp if youre concerned enough to be here asking the question and youre answering yes to the above more often than not its probably safe to assume that your drinking is a problem or is likely to become one dont worry though help is at hand and you can recover recognising that you have a problem that you cant solve all by yourself and asking for help is the first step towards doing something about it hope that someone found this in some way useful or relatable do let me know if ive missed any off woody,pre-pandemic
now i realize that selfdiagnosis might be a bit of a touchy subject to some people and maybe thats what the seeking diagnosis flair the one i happen to be using myself since well its the most accurate one at the moment is meant to accomplish to some degree but with such a wide range of flairs on this subreddit i find it a bit odd that selfdiagnosed with disorder arent present although i dont exactly think that parentsiblingfriend of someone selfdiagnosed with disorder should be a thing sincethats just a little too word in my eyes but what do i know i get that selfdiagnosis is far from accurate and in the case of someone like me itd be only temporary because i do have appointments scheduled but not everyone is in the same position as me in some areas of the world said diagnosis might be too expensive or they might be in a particular family situation where people refuse to let them be diagnosed for one reason or another so while it wouldnt be not an urgent addition i think it would be fairly beneficial to the noninsignificant amount of people who havent beencant be diagnosed professionally v,pre-pandemic
for the past few weeks ive been slowly tapering off my coffee intake by mixing in decaf i used to drink two mugs of strong coffee every day and i was constantly nervous and oversensitive to social situations logically these two seemed related so i started the process of quitting today was a particularly bad social anxiety day i felt constantly overwhelmed i was sitting in a group trying not to fidget or shake with anxiety at so many people potentially perceiving me and i just felt like i was going to cry for no particular reason every tiny mistake i made felt like a meteor hitting earth and annihilating all life and it was my fault i wanted to crawl under a rock and just stay there for eternity i came home and made myself a small mug of fully caffeinated coffee half an hour later i feel so much better i drank coffee and im calm and im so mad about it because being on coffee was bad but the withdrawal made my anxiety so much worse has anyone had similar experience is there something simple that you found helps or exacerbates your social anxiety,post-pandemic

i was diagnosed with cyclothymia a couple months ago and found this sub a great please to lurk i had a pretty severe depressive episode in june that led to being diagnosed i guess im still dealing with the diagnosis im having a really hard time not just up and leaving the life of have established i have kids their dad and i are still close we dont have a traditional marriage but that fuck up is another story i feel like i cant trust myself or fully function im not sure if what im experiencing is agitated hypomania or a mixed episode but i havent been able to go to work all week and its this strange mix of crying and feeling like a failure and just not giving a shit all accompanied by rice paper thin patience and obtuse anger im exhausted and i feel so alone i just want to feel normal again but i get the feeling thats out of reach im scared of what people think of me between missing work and the phone calls sobbing to my mom at odd hours im not really sure what im trying to accomplish with this post im just hoping someone out there understands how long did it take for you to come to terms with a bipolar diagnosis and how did you cope with the way that changed peoples perception of you how did you have to change your perception of yourself ps even if you read this and dont post a comment thank you it feels good to be heard even if im just shouting into the black abyss of the internet,pre-pandemic
who else became really good at seducing men as a way to control them in order to survive i was sexualized starting as a child from my father through mostly covert sexual abuse the way i survived was by seducing and flirting with him my mom was out to get me and the way i learner to receive love was by seducing it became a way for me to get control in an unsafe situation if i got the man to develop a crush on me distract them and become infatuated i was more able to control them so i was safe i notice this pattern will come out especially around unsafe and angry men ive done this technique when i felt i was being discriminated against too it gets the men to let their guard down be nicer to me and get what i want because to them i am flattering their ego and playing submissive obviously this is maladaptive coping mechanism that i am unlearning but yeah i realized recently it has helped me survive racism and sexism and to avoid others aggression i also realized i liked how it kept me safe and gave me power in an unsafe situation it gave me power over my abusers and i was able to punish men by seducing them and rejecting them and keeping myself safe sometimes i think about about becoming a stripper because i am really good at seducing and making myself into a mans dream girl who else relates,pre-pandemic

my partner of 6 years has spiraled really hard into alcoholism it started in 20202021 it causes a massive strain on our relationship because hes also an asshole when drunk and either tries picking fights with me or just raging around if i dont engage with him i dont drink at all for context its finally gotten to a point where 1 week ago today i banned alcohol from the house if he wants to stay with me i told him if i come home to find him drunk again we are done he threw away all the alcohol we talked about how i can support him in this and tried to implement the supportive measures we discussed he seemed serious about it well exactly one week later i come home to find him drunk once i had confirmation that he had consumed alcohol in the house again i told him we are not discussing this until hes sober that was last night we are both at work now and i have to talk to him when i get home i have no idea what to do anymore do i need to hold my ground on my ultimatum i dont want him to think he can continue crossing my boundaries or do i recognize that hes trying that he made it through a week sober should i try pushing him towards a program before i give up on us alsois it possibly my fault it seems all 3 of my serious adult relationships ended in substance abuse and im starting to worry that somehow im driving my partners to substance abuse,post-pandemic
there was a point in june 2020 where i drank every single day of the month it became a routine and i really had to put in significant mental effort to not drink every night somehow i quit however i recently moved to a new city where i know no one i find myself drinking every night once again and definitely looking forward to it ive been drinking most days for the last two months i realized that my trend with drinking is when i get bored for an extended period of time the alcohol cures the boredom i was wondering if most of you also drink because theres simply nothing else to do x200b,post-pandemic
hi all i want to ask that you try to follow up on your posts in the comment section did you have a worrisome headache stomach ache test result etc and post about it come back later hours days weeks afterward and post about what happened how long did the symptom end up lasting how did you find relief what was the probable cause anxiety dehydration gas etc this is especially important if nothing happened that means that the symptom just resolved and youre okay do it for the others who may be struggling with the same worry and do it for yourself so you can look back on your past anxieties and see how they played out eventually your post history will become a record of selfassurance wait i know ive worriedposted about this before how did it turn out last time oh yeah the symptom went away in a few hours i think we can all learn a lot by looking at our anxiety in hindsight and being able to revisit our past worries and the corresponding closure,pre-pandemic

aba is more focused on reinforcing desirables behaviors and help undesirable behaviors go extinct take the following example and see how aba would be applied client a is watching tv the tv plays a medical commercial client a begins to panic they proceed to google about symptoms until they find information that tells them they are not likely to have the disease in the commercial after a day of googling and panic client a finds the information and calms down in aba we would break this down to three part contingency abc antecedent behavior and consequence antecedent aka the trigger a medical commercial plays behavior client panics and proceeds to google symptoms until they find information that calms them down consequence after a day of googling they find information and calm down so in this scenario the undesirable behavior is the client is panic googling about their symptoms to calm down in aba we would want to reinforce a coping behavior that is healthier some examples of healthy coping include reaching out to a trusted friend removing yourself from the environment to go for a walk focusing on different activities the rbt registered behavioral technician would then run trials approved by a clinical director where they would present the stimulus medical commercial plays at random times during session and they would reinforce the behaviors healthy coping mechanism such redirecting them from googling their symptoms through different types of prompts and learning techniques shaping or token prize systems for example when the medical commercial plays trial 1 client walks to computer to google error rbt provides error correction by gesturing a phone client calls friend instead trial 2 client walks to computer to google error rbt provides error correction by verbally suggesting to walk outside client complies and walks outside trial 3 client walks towards computer but decides to walk towards door instead independent rbt reinforces behavior by giving them their 1st token 3 tokens are needed to redeem trial 4 client walks towards phone and turns off tv to talk to friend independent rbt reinforces behavior by giving them the 2nd token trial 5 client walks towards door and calls friend to talk independent rbt gives last token rbt reinforces behavior by letting client cash out and letting them watch their favorite show for 30 minutes during session now this scenario does not run through a noncompliance scenario client gets aggressive because they cannot google symptoms but there are many techniques as well such as rbt prompting client waiting for client to calm down redirecting the client with simple tasks blink clap touch nose goes back to original task of calling friend instead of googling the overall goal is for the client to go through these trials and eventually fade all the assistance from the rbt so that the client can become independent at managing their reaction to medical commercials but yeah what do you think of this nonintrusive approach to treating health anxiety,post-pandemic
does anyone else experience this today i was struggling to wake up early and have the energy to crawl out of bed because i knew i had 7 hours of baseball to play today and there would be no bench time the mere thought of that was making it hard to wake up then the games got canceled and now ive got plenty of energy to do stuff so what was making me tired just the thought of exerting all that energy this happens to me at work too having a big project mountain to climb is very exhausting stimulant meds help me start tackling the big mountain but i dont want to take meds every day,pre-pandemic

this ozempic era is making me so mad not only do people think they can definitively tell if someones on ozempic just because they lost weight they then make all these moral accusations like how theyre taking it from diabetics when you dont even know if theyre on it if someone accused me of being on ozempic while actually being super deep in an ed id lose it i genuinely dont know how to respond to that accusation which i think mayy sort of be happening to me right now with some coworkers my instinct is to snap back at them and be all actually i have a horrific eating disorder thats ruining every facet of my life but that seems immature they already think im a little spoiled bitch its just the icing on the cake that they now may think that one of the biggest struggles of my life is just more proof of my superficiality,post-pandemic
im a 25 year old male who still hasnt been able to find his confidence due to an already present low self esteem beginning as a teenager and years of ostracism im pretty far behind in social skills for someone my age honestly at this point im just about tired of my shyness being used as a source of amusement for people my natural instinctual urge is to tell them to go fuck themselves but im not sure if theres a lighter less hostile response that i should maybe give im pretty sensitive to this as its been the source for most of the shame ive felt for many years this is the sort of thing that conjures up a lot of suicidal thoughts at the thought of still having to deal with this teasing at a much later age i just want to be seen and treated as a regular human being and not just something to poke fun at an example that i can give is when someone notices that im a little quiet or awkward and so theyll ask me super personal or inappropriate questions to see how i react if its a guy theyll either crack jokes at my expense or are very stand offish in attempts to intimidate me if its a girl especially a very conventionally attractive one then theyll try to use their good looks to make me uncomfortable by flirting even though they have no genuine interest in me i think im a little bit more self aware and wise to fall for such obvious tricks it honestly just really fucking aggravates me because its so damn obvious to me whenever someone is trying to fuck with me i try to be respectful towards everyone and avoid unnecessary drama so thats why it bugs me so much whenever someone is trying to make a fool out of me because what did i really do to deserve it i can be an asshole and i probably should be more often than i ever am but i really just want to be left alone im quiet shy and a bit awkward ok i get it i dont care that is not a valid excuse for them to be assholes i get it im easy bait but i dont want to be bait anymore i hate to be so defensive and serious all the time but i almost feel like i have to be im forced to take myself seriously because nobody else will i get that jokes can be intended as just harmless fun but more often than not i feel theres genuine malicious intent behind these so called jokes the difference between when something is actually just a joke and when its an insult disguised as a joke mostly depends on whos the one saying it if its an actual real genuine friend im less likely to take it serious but if its someone who i dont know too well or im not too close with then it really does feel a lot more personal i dont want to be the guy that cant take a joke when its actually just a joke but i also dont want to be a seen as a pushover that never stands up for himself when its necessary do i just laugh along with them and respond with something witty maybe try self deprecating humor itd be pretty pathetic of me and embarrassing to just laugh it off whenever the person is being serious do i just ignore it i might look like a punk if i dont do or say anything do i react defensively i might appear emotionally reactive and too sensitive what the fuck am i honestly supposed to do id really rather not have to deal with this sort of shit in the first place but until i become more normal im not sure what to do id like to get to a point where i can be seen as just another ordinary person that doesnt have to deal with constant teasing the way that i do im getting a little too old to still be the butt of peoples jokes btw i dont get teased for being quietshy as much today as i used to when i was a teenager then again i dont go out much at all on my free time when im not at work most customers talk to me respectfully but im sure thats just because they need a favor from me i have turned away customers and refused service when i felt like theyve stepped out of line im really just looking for advice for if it does happen because i still feel like im easy prey,post-pandemic

to the living room and sit on the couch and immediately try to call my mom i wanted to ask her when is she coming back but she didnt pick up her phone and he went down too approaching me and i try to hide the fact that i was trying to call my mom from him i get up and desperately text my bsfcan i call youuu im in trouble rn sum like that he asked me what am i doing i told him im texting my bsf he took a chair and told me sit beside him and im like waittt then he just grabbed my wrist and make me sit down on the chair i was still texting my bsf like spamming her please answer my calls i need

his left arm to my waist as he kept watching me being on my phone then he tries to touch me on my chest again my bsf called me she saw my spams and i quickly answered it and we were jokingly laughing talking about random shit i was legit still shaking in fear and then i got up and kept talking to my bsf and said i wanna go to the bathroomm as soon as i went to the bathroom i locked it and explained to her everything that happened in text i was trying to calm down i stepped outside he saw me still talking to my bsf and he suddenly just fuck off somewhere else outside it was evening i went back to my other house i had my moms keys with me theres my lil cousin with me he wanted to take his clothes that he left in our house i gave it to him and there was a motorbike parked in front of the door that i didnt close he went inside and saw that my lil cousin was with me he walk pass me to the kitchen pretending to look for his other bro he randomly asked me if i saw his other bro and im like what no hes not here then he just fuck off and i let my lil cousin outside i made sure i locked all the doors then i took a shower and rest in the room it was getting dark i was still scrolling through my phone until i heard someone trynna open the main door with a key i panicked and i was so sure that my keys were with me i locked the door in the room i was in i can still hear keys jangling and attempts to open the door luckily that door is strong and secure enough idk if i heard that right or im just hallucinating but it was loud and clear i stayed in the room for a while but after a few hours i stepped outside and check the windows to see if theres still someone at the door there was nobody but i highly assume it was him again i called my mom again asking when is she coming back she finnaly answered me and said in a few minutes after it happened i didnt tell a soul except my bsf i kinda wanted to tell my mom expecting she would do something about it and comfort me it takes courage to do so after a few weeks i finnaly spoke to her about it it went south i mean im a freaking dumbass to trust my narcissistic mom and its basically my fault at first she was shock she asked me where did he touch you i answered her question but then she said thats all the satans doings im like huh she proceed to tell me you shouldve come with me hm and you could just stay outside uh mom even so there is no one outside he could literally js grab me back inside and why would i stay outside its hot asf u took decades to come back i was speechless and felt sick she made me feel like its my fault i shouldve done better i was silent and upset the whole time after she said those to me gosh i hate her so much she just continuing on talking and spending time with him happily like nothing happened i didnt want to sleep in my grandmas house ever again i felt bad that i couldnt sleep with her again shes so nice but it upsets me no one knows the truth about him his mom was nice but my heart sank everytime they speak highly about him i had to pretend like nothing happened between us idk if im being dramatic or this was nothing at and im js overeating,post-pandemic

you know it you meet someone boom 24 hours later youve mapped out your future for me this is always in a romantic sense this person likes me ive got my hopes up bpd me is like date them make it exclusive tie them down so they cant leave you you know what i did i told this person when it came up in the conversation that im not in the place to date seriously that im happy to see where things go and just hang out and have fun i didnt pressure them to date me or try and work out if they wanted to date me i left it light and breezy obviously the bpd part of my brain is screaming but i actually managed to do it i actually managed to convince myself that this person is not my soulmate ive known them a week and that trying to lock them down in a relationship is neither healthy nor wise for either of us this may seem tiny but for me this is a massive achievement,pre-pandemic
not saying its for everyone but it really gave me a place to relax and shake all my paranoid thoughts allot of drug trials like the one i was in give your your own room and space to live for 68weeks during this time you take medication and take tests they treat you superbly and made at least 5 new and good friends while i was there they pay for door dash and pay you per day 80200 depending on the drug company behind the test i highly recommend seeking out these places to get really good intensive 1 on 1 care with a team of doctors ive done 3 clinical trials and would do it again if i could its actually how i found out about the current medication im taking,post-pandemic

as you have read actor robin williams is dead an apparent suicide in interviews williams alluded to depressive episodes and manic behavior at least on stage as late as 2006 in an npr interview he denied any official diagnosis of depression or bipolar disorder his casual comments about mood swings have led some writers to label him bipolar in news reports but there appears to be no medical confirmation of his illness and thats fine a mans medical condition is his own business and none of ours ultimately it doesnt matter if williams suffered from bipolar disorder or major depressive disorder whats significant here and now is that a man with huge critical acclaim with great wealth with golden globes and an oscar this man who had everythingeven with all that he was moved to end his life i want to tell this to people who say i should just go for a 20minute walk in the sunshine every afternoon and my depression will go away after all it worked for them when they were sad after their dog ran away i want to remind people of it when they tell me bipolar disorder is just moods and that i ought to be able to shake them off the ones who say i would be productive if only i felt it important enough implying that i dont care or that i am merely lazy i want to rub peoples face in the fact that there is not always a correlation between success and untroubled happiness bipolar disorder and depression are not the same as the sadness that naturally follows after setbacks and bad luck i want to thrust the headlines under the noses of people who assure me id be fine if i switched to the latest macrobiotic diet or if i stopped watching the news and thinking sad thoughts to all of those who have sought to dismiss my bipolar disorder as just mood swingsto all of those who have found me depressed and asked why as if my depression must be a normal emotional response to a sad eventto all those who have minimized my victory in getting through the day and concluded that i could shake off this disease and do anything if i were just motivated enoughrobin williams and i say fuck you depression is an electrochemical disorder in the brain it is not the same as the everyday depression we feel when we get a b instead of an a on the sociology exam mania and hypomania are physiological states of being out of control not of moral irresponsibility robin williams had everything a man could want then depression reached out of his cold soul and snuffed him out so dont tell me its just a bad mood my family and friends have tried to be sympathetic and i give them credit for it but in all the years since my diagnosis not one has consistently understood that this is a disease not a bad mood i see them bite their tongues as they carefully dont say why dont you just decide to feel better the way i did after i got passed over for the promotion i had worked so hard to get when normal people try to understand what we go through by comparing it to the everyday moods they call depressed and manic it offends me when people casually refer to their moodiness as bipolar it hurts us all i suffer from bipolar ii last i checked that puts me at higher risk of suicide than any other mental illness my disease is more likely to kill me than obesity would or smoking a pack a day of cigarettes suicide is right here with me at my elbow every day im sorry robin williams is dead im sad for his family and his fans im going to wring some good out of his life and his death by using his suicide as a teaching moment for the people around me,pre-pandemic

basically over the years my mother has always given me toystools used specifically for this when she sees my hands getting injured but i struggle to use them my hands will always be there and sharp pain is usually the satisfaction picking at them until they get inflamed its not self harm because i genuinely dont like it when i realise im doing it but it also is the only thing that keeps me grounded when im thinking i think my issue is that i struggle to consciously realise im doing it and then swap to the healthier method whenever i do eventually realise and swap my thought train would completely crumble i really want the healthier one to become the default without thinking i also struggle with holding objects i guess i have a weird habit of always needing to wash my hands after touching something new or for too long its like im sensitive if i can feel the slightest bit of residue dirt or sweat forming thats something i can consciously work on though so im still happy to try object recommendations just in case i find one that works if theres anyone out there who was successful in changing minor pain stims to something healthier please let me know what helped my thumbs will thank you,post-pandemic

i just wanted to share with people wholl understand id been seeing him since i was first diagnosed when i was 16 im 24 now i can honestly say he saved my life he always managed to find the right combination of meds and hes the main reason ive been relatively stable moodwise for the past 4 years it wasnt a huge shock he was very old and i always knew he would end up dying while i was his patient but at the same time it felt like hed live forever he studied psychiatry because his brother died by suicide and he practiced medicine until the day he died i always admired that about him he was a good man so cheers to my former doctor i wanted to give him a tribute of sorts hopefully this is an appropriate space for that,pre-pandemic

i know it doesnt sound like a lot but ive been clean from oxys for 200 days straight now the longest ive been able to pull off in 10 years i truly feel like this time is gonna stick for good i was finally able to identify all the lies i told myself to keep relapsing and all the ways the drugs were holding me back in life my regret over wasting so many years of my life and so much of my money is enough motivation not to go back but i know its not gonna be that easy i just wanted to post here because no one in my life knows about the addiction they somewhat know at my worst i couldnt hide it but not that its been a 10 year ordeal im still dealing with and finally making real steps to get past,pre-pandemic
most everyone here already knows this this is to the people who disbelieve in it and i hope to reach the ignorant or misinformed the insomnia is real no one chooses to stay up all night and go to bed at 4am be tired as hell in the morning and feel like ran over garbage the triggers are real certain movies noises and visuals can cause anger fear anxiety depression and sadness to the point of crying even for noncryers this is due to the feeling of reliving the events the trust issues and suspicions about people are real and dont take it personally ever hear i like to keep most things to my self thats an autoresponse nothing personal the nightmares are real sometimes nightmares of reliving the event and then waking up feeling a chaos of bad emotions often ruining your entire daydays anxiety is real and is often because of insert events creating it for people who didnt have it prior avoiding talking about it and avoiding things that remind you of it doesnt make the problem invalid and arent just faking it its a logical natural coping mechanism to avoid thinking about it an aversion to being physically touched is real ever hear dont touch me or the person is uncomfortable with being touched well the insert event is likely related to that again dont take it personally point being no one fakes anything i listed above for the sake of feeling pity or just playing the victim its a real problem just like anything else and it doesnt only apply to veterans and law enforcement hope i could shed some insight,pre-pandemic

i normally just lurk on reddit rather than post but knowing im not suffering alone helps im scared im going to become some lazy depressive person who locks themselves inside their house due to fear i constantly overthink that some nasty diseaseillness is going to randomly get me due to my physical symptoms like palpitations and an upset stomach even though ive had normal blood tests and ekgs the only thing that helps me be productive is cleaning around the house and organising as it tends to take my mind off of things im also obsessed with ghibli movies i find them so comforting since they tend to take me away from reality i dont want to take drugs i was prescribed propanol but havent touched it since i can seem to manage my heart palpitations by myself but my sensitive stomach is annoying do you guys have anything soothing that you like to consume i recently have become fond of ginger or chamomile teas they are soothing,post-pandemic
anybody else have absolutely awful emotional permanence if you dont know what that means heres a definition emotional permanence is when you can maintain certainty that your partner or other loved ones cares about you even when you are not in their presence or when they are not actively telling you that they care about you i have like absolutely no ability to do that with my current fp he can reassure me he can send me some sweet message or we can spend actual physical time together in which he says a lot of nice things and says he likes me and all that but almost immediately afterwards i start to overthink start to doubt start to get paranoid wonder if hes lying if he actually hates me and thinks im annoying if hes playing some sick game where hes typing these things to me but actually laughing behind the screen at me believing in it etc sometimes if im in an especially ok mental state and if his words were especially romantic and sweet i might be able to survive like 12 maybe even 3 days of nolow contact and still keep believing that he likes me and im not annoying to ensure this i usually have to keep going back to the messages either in the chat itself or in my screenshots thats another thing i have to screenshot every single like especially sweet message which made me really happy so i can go back and keep reading it and reassuring myself it happened and it was real and he said that and keep rereading it and keep trying to remember how i felt when i read it for the first time which is generally giddy and very happy or i have to try to close my eyes and remember him telling me something he told me directly or try to imagine looking into his eyes or how his touch felt or something i have to try to bring myself back to the moment itself and how i felt then but heres another catch my memories are always so foggy and distant and weird ive seen some people refer to this as dissociation but idk if thats what it is but even like the literal next day or a couple of days after something happens it feels so far away and distant like it happened a month or two ago or it happened to somebody else or im imagining it or i saw it in a movie or something i literally hung out with my fp a couple of days ago and it already feels so far away and i am desperately mentally grasping at the memory trying to hold on to how his touch felt and his voice sounded and what sort of things we talked about but its already slipping away this makes the emotional permanence so much harder a normal person like him is probably still happy from that day and still ok and feeling like we spent time together recently but it feels like we didnt meet for like a month to me already and im already wondering if he actually hates me and thinks im annoying or if i said anything wrong or acted weird or whatever sorry this was long anybody else dealing with this or have tips for how to stop obsessing over this and how to improve my emotional permanence,post-pandemic
trigger warning mentions of self harm and suicide please take this down if its not suitible for the reddit ive tried seeking medical advice with being told i should get over it myself and looking for advice i was diagnosed with autism when i was 3 but ive always been very emotional and my mental health has never fully been stable im not sure if this is because of just autism possibly anything else or a combo of bothmultiple things ive talked with my partner who has bpd about my feelingsmental healthimpulsesdepersonalizationpast with self harm and thoughts of suicide and she feels like i should get tested but when i tried before i was basically sent away to resolve it myself i know that some things can be mistaken for autism but i cant shake it that theres more than just that going on i wanted to be able to get some form of answers as that would help me understand how to pursue my mental health improve relationships but it feels like the health system only wants to care when my life is in danger because of my own actions how did you all get your diagnosis thank you,post-pandemic

hi reddit i posted my adderall recovery journey 34 months ago and a few users suggested i post it every few months in case others find it useful im going to try to remember to do that so here it is i quit after taking this stuff for 10 years and havent touched it in over 15 months this is all just my experience and others may have a different opinion but for me this is what it took im not here to judge anyone else or say whats rightwrong this is simply my journey i had to go cold turkey i tried quitting many times but cold turkey is all that ever worked everything else is just denial or an excuse i told myself i would taper down or slowly stop or whatever but i just needed to stop and stop making excuses i found reading other peoples journey was helpful when i was trying to quit so heres mine in the event it gives you even an ounce of conviction or strength i took adderall for 10 years 2131 and quit just over a year ago i live in san francisco and have a very demanding fast paced job in tech where i manage a team so that was the part that made me the most nervous but i realized i was picking everything else over my health i got to a point where i needed adderall to be me so was that even me it was so so hard for the first 23 months i was so tired and felt like a zombie but was just gentle as fuck with myself and after the 3 month mark i felt functional around the 56 month mark i felt good actually like a new person never in a trillion years did the old adderall me ever think id be able to be disciplinedproductive without it but here i am happy have normal energy like a normal human just as successful in my job i def underperformed for those 34 months keeping my head above water professionally was the hardest part but treating each day i said no to adderall as a victory was how i got by reading stories on here and quittingadderallcom helped make an account distract yourself by engaging on there exercising first thing in the am before my brain could realize how tired it was i was very hungry so cookingprepping healthy food was key as well fresh whole fruitsveg ltyrosine magnesium fish oil and other vitamins that may or may not have helped but i did like the tradition of taking pills every morning they probably helped theres a lot of info online about different things you can take to help with brain health as you recover i even took pre workout powder with water each am in the beginning to get a little kick whatever it took time sleep clean eating exercisemoving coffee distractionquittingadderallcom supplements thats what did it in that order i also found not eating after 7pm really helped with the morning brain fog my point i remember it very clearly for years the guilt of taking this drug i went through all the normal phases of first discovering it loving the shit out of it everything was suddenly so amazing until it wasnt becoming uber successful professionally and subsequently setting a standard at work thats just not humanely sustainable then slowly realizing that i didnt feel like i used to that maybe i was a bit of a productivity robot i felt i needed adderall to be the talkative fun friend everyone expected me to be creating anxiety that maybe i just needed to accept that i was adderall i needed adderall and then the ok im not addicted ill just have a few a week i dont need to quit full stop maybe just half of one a day or maybe i just stop for a little bit and see how i feel so i should just keep this bottle handy in case it doesnt go well then i listened to that insane dependent mental negotiation i was doing with myself and realized yeeeeep thats an addicts negotiation tactic this is not healthy i always made excuses for needing it a big project a friends bachelorette party an event whatever i even went through the denial phase of this is a medication i have adhd my medical doctor gave me this its medicine oh brother that was the hardest phase because i knew deeeeeep down i was in denial grasping at such an easy excuse for myself this is just my own experience im sharing here to each their own then i realized that i have a very full life so there would always be an excuse was i really so insecure that i didnt think the undrugged me could handle it i then realized i didnt even know me was i willing to live an entire lifetime without ever knowing my authentic self i was so scared i started by committing to one day at a time mini goals and like i said every day was celebrated like a victory just one more day one more week the first 23 months i was a sleeping sittingatdesking eating slowmo exercising machine i felt like i got hit by a truck then it got better then it got ok then it got good then it got great now i feel amazing dont get me wrong i dont feel high i feel like a normal human with normal waves of emotion tiredness energy creativity anger sadness happiness excitement laughter everything normal waves not extreme waves like addy gives you its so good to be alive and get to know me anyone can be someone on adderall and there are very similar traits but theres only one you get to know you the playful you itll take a while to get back that person so be patient and loving with yourself dont think that whoever you meet the first few months is the new you its not it takes a little longer i am also amazed at how capable i am i think back to 78 months ago and i feel like i produce just as much at work im not hyper focused with quick witted things to say in meetings but i get my shit done i get it done well and i feel real i remember the struggle i remember the self doubt i remember the fear i still think of adderall every day and occasionally want it but i mostly think i cant believe i fucking took that capsule full of little toxic beads every single day for 10 years wtf was i thinking which is major progress from what i felt for the first few months i just want one just half of one ill start next week it takes time discipline and self love id say the self love is was kept my drive to stay off of it high ive worked hard on myself throughout my life and deserve to be as healthy as im capable of being i want to have a family some day and they deserve a healthy me as well why rob myself of that im sorry this is so long but the details are important its not easy please feel free to dm me if i can help you got this youre capable and amazing without any drugs get excited to get to know the real you the undrugged pure you,pre-pandemic

im going to tell a hypothetical story i mightve been diagnosed with adhd around the age of 6 i didnt know that my teachers and doctor told my mom this until a few months ago we were both drinking and she told me i dont think she even remembers anyway i mightve come upon an adderall pill i mightve taken it and it isnt at all what i expected holy shit the peace that i feel made me cry i have always had this constant buzzing inside of my body that just felt like anxious energy i couldnt control my head has always felt full and a lot of the times i have multiple trains of thought going at once or just another train of thought going aaaaaaaaaaaaaa in the background of my thoughts i thought i would have a fun day being wired i feel so fucking calm and at peace the buzzing is gone i have one train of thought that i can keep going i watched an hour long tv show the whole thing i just feel normal i feel so regular is this how u guys with adhd feel when you take your adderall this was crazy for me to experience i have never had that anxious energy inside my body be gone and its gone right now hypothetically,post-pandemic
three years ago i had to take antibiotics for an infection i had to take two different rounds of two different antibiotics because the first one didnt clear up the infection the first round of antibiotics made me really depressed the second round made me very suicidal as bad as its ever been all of the other times its been really really bad i dont remember if it was during the first round that i looked it up or the second when it got worse but apparently its a known side effect of antibiotics which no one ever tells you so anyway i powered through it hoping that i would feel better after i stopped taking the antibiotics which i did thank god well ive been taking a low dose of doxycycline for a couple years for rosacea at low doses its just has an antiinflammatory effect and not an antibiotic effect because of this i didnt think it could be causing my depression which has been unrelenting no matter what medication i try i just decided to stop taking it and see if it makes a difference and within a few days my depression is almost completely gone i feel like a new person my rosacea is very uncomfortable i feel like i have a constant sun burn but id much rather have that and not be suicidal so im going to just live with the rosacea i also take lamotrigine and caplyta i was feeling like the caplyta was helping a little bit but not that much now i feel pretty much fine since stopping the doxycycline i also use a topical antibiotic on my face metronidazole gel which im going to stop using today and see if that makes a difference as well what a miracle to feel normal its been literally years and years heres an amazing study i just found today when i was trying to find information on whether the metronidazole gel was also having an effect,post-pandemic

one day at work someone started talking about the nationwide shortage of adderall and my boss made the comment that adhd is just an excuse for laziness so i told her that i suffer from adhd and ptsd and neither of those are an excuse for laziness welp if i didnt paint a target on my back all of a sudden im getting extra work on my schedule there was a 4 day work week with pto the following monday where i arrived to work being told that we need you to run these 4 tests in two days and get us the data before your pto they never asked me if i could handle this task instead they asked my coworker if it was doable for someone to run 2 of these tests in one day and have the data in before someone were to go on pto my coworker told them that it was possible to run the two methods in one day but getting the data would take at least a day and a half for the twotest days well since it takes this coworker 4 hours to get one of the two tests on it should be no problem for me to do two of the tests in 8 hours and since coworker said a day and an half for data boss will give me just a day to process each double run i was set up for failure this isnt the first time this has happened the continuous micromanagement and the constant comparison of perceived time frames only lead to more gaslighting and sabotage its sad when your own coworkers look over your schedule and tell your boss this amount of work isnt even possible for them to do them being a subject matter expert guess what i get even more work one week i get a message from boss that coworker called in sick so we need you to run their test today on top of your other test but ive never done the other test before oh it will be an easy prep dont worry bosss friend nods and says yeah its just these two simple preps but again i am not trained in the other test nor have i even looked at the test procedure until today doesnt matter we need you to run this when you make a mistake this goes in your end of year performance review what do you do when your boss is blatantly trying to sabotage your career coworkers just say im sorry and then give a good thing its not happening to me shrug why should i fear losing my job and my healthcare because my boss has a personal vendetta of getting me fired why should i be talked to about my performance when my coworkers agree they couldnt even keep up with the amount of work im being given why am i being targeted after disclosing my hidden disabilities to a terrible boss not just my opinion but the concensus is no one wants to deal with her,post-pandemic

been seeing a lot of peopke freaking out about the coronavirus spreading i blame the news outlets for amplifying it so heres a few things to remember 1 you are more likely to get the flu or a common cold than the coronavirus 2 your chances of getting the coronavirus are extremely low especially if you havent been to china within the past month 3 most of the people who have died have had other underlying health issues or were older 4 all of the cases in the us were people who traveled to wuhan there have been no reports of human to human transmission in the us 5 say you do get the coronavirus most people get mild coldflu symptoms 6 wash your hands use hand sanitizer stay hydrated eat right dont fucking go to schoolwork if youre sick it will help stop the spread of germs 7 get your fucking flu shot none of you are going to die from the coronavirus the flu kills more people each year mainly the elderlychildren people with compromised immune systems the media likes to hype things up to the max ia thr coronavirus a problem sure so is the flu and so so many people get that each year and survive relax,pre-pandemic

if you are horribly burned in a fire you can take drugs to relieve the pain if you shatter your spine you can take drugs to relieve the pain if you are addicted to drugs and your life has turned to utter and total shit you can take drugs to relieve the pain and thats how the trap works imagine if the only cure for burn pain was fire imagine if the cure for back pain was whacking yourself in the spine with a hammer the drug addict is caught in an analogous situation the only fast reliable remedy for the psychological pain of drug addiction is drugs there are other cures a notable one is not doing drugs but they are all slower and less reliable somehow the lure of feeling better now overrides the hope of feeling better later this is the basic mechanism of addiction the behavior of an addict is perfectly logical in the short term and perfectly illogical in the long term because life exists in the long term addiction is illogical overall what is surprising how easily addiction can ensnare people who are perfectly intelligent and selfdisciplined you can go to certain parts of any sizable city in america and watch drugs addicts totter around looking at their blighted faces their filthy clothes their total lack of selfregard you would be forgiven for thinking that they lack selfdiscipline how could you think otherwise when a person cant be bothered to shower much less get a proper job or just stop smoking crack for more than a few hours what else could you call it but a lack of selfdiscipline imagine the nazi troops at stalingrad encircled by the soviet troops fighting against total annihilation would you look at these troops these underslept unshaven men in stinking unwashed clothes and accuse them of lacking selfdiscipline would you say tuttut these nazis are an undisciplined lot of course not you would understand that their shabby state is not from a lack of selfdiscipline but rather because they are concerned with other things dire things while there are several notable differences between nazi soldiers and crack heads the same principle is in effect for both for both there has been a terrible reordering of priorities the showering the clean clothes the job all of these become secondary to fast access to the drug if showering and clean clothes got them fast access to the drug they would walk around looking like a detergent commercial you would never see whites so white but they dont need clean clothes they dont need showers they need drugs the drugs are the solution to everything highly selfdisciplined people are actually quite vulnerable to drug addiction it is because they believe that they need to control their feelings they often seek to simply eliminate bad feelings just as they seek to eliminate underperformance from every other area of their lives the demon of addiction looks at their grand selfdiscipline and giggles with glee it knows that it will be precisely this selfdiscipline that will bring them to heel they will selfdiscipline themselves right into total obedience to the drug as an example look at prince and michael jackson were they selfdisciplined definitely the world has hardly seen such selfdiscipline they were obsessive workaholics devoted to their careers and they propelled themselves to the very pinnacle of professional success they both knew the dangers of drug addiction and fastidiously avoided drugs keep in mind avoiding drugs in 1980s hollywood must have been like avoiding water in a swimming pool at the bottom of the fucking ocean yet they managed to do it for a while because they had selfdiscipline now they are both dead they were both destroyed by drug addiction in the end selfdiscipline was not enough to save them why not because selfdiscipline is just a talent an accomplishment and like any other talent or accomplishment it can be turned and made to serve the dark master what then is our defense against this menace what is the answer,pre-pandemic
i am 25 nearly 26 ive been depressed since i was a child with insomnia problems eight years ago my then gf committed suicide and since then i have ptsd which its been diagnosed recently since i started going to therapy in september of last year i take meds our relationship lasted only nine months but it was so intense she had ptsd herself because her dad committed suicide and she at 8 years old found him hanging she also had other problems and at moments she was uncontrollable but i truly loved her i waited so long to go to therapy because of economical reasons and because my parents are absolutely against psychologists and let alone psychiatrists theyre only for the crazy people they always said ive also had other smaller traumatic events since then that amplified my illness the fact is while grieving i moved on with my life and now i have the most beautiful and loving girlfriend a person can desire im working in the career path i always wanted and im very respected at work in some weeks im moving to live alone for some months and then my gf will come with me i get along with my parents better than in the past but at the same moment i feel destroyed tired sometimes my mind get out of my control and i get lost in horrible and suicidal thoughts in the feelings i felt when s committed suicide i begin crying for hours and lose control of my mind and actions i pull my hair i move uncontrollably in my bed its debilitating sometimes i stop and i think how the fuck could i get this far in my life despite all other times the guilt of moving on with my life after the traumatic event gets me and destroys me i feel like im not paying respect to s like im doing something wrong to her even though shes not here anymore since the trauma and posttrauma ive never felt as bad as this period and im thinking of kms before the end of the year i dont have the energy to still move on with life i feel done ive done enough and ive suffered enough i dont know when but i think itll happen probably soon its the only future i can see,post-pandemic
a bit over a year ago i saw a dead body on a school trip a trip consisting of 68 people i think we were on our way to learn about water energy and filtering and on our way to the on site class room we looked across the river running besides us and saw a dead body washed up we returned to school promptly the day after a police officer came to talk to us and just repeated everything we had heard before its not normal for you guys to see that im sorry as soon as we left we checked the local news and found articles about the incident and i do admit that was a move that i shouldnt have made but i was so curious and wanted to know who we found ever since that happened last december i have felt bleak i cant watch action films anymore just in case they show a dead body my friend that was with me sometimes brings it up around people if it somehow fits in the context of the conversation and it really upsets me because of course i dont want to remember it anyway not sure how or when i will recover so yay,post-pandemic

hi everyone i have a question regarding ed recovery as an autistic person i had an eating disorder in high school but it was never about losing weight i just wanted to eat the same things at the same times every day my disorder was mostly caused by my ocd and my autisms need for control and sameness i ended up underweight because i wasnt eating enough and my ocd made me worried about health i was obsessed with sameness my strict routine made me happy i tried intuitive eating as part of my recovery and ended up overeating because i have trouble telling if im hungry or full i gained a lot of weight then lost down to a normal weight by paying attention to calories unfortunately counting calories triggers my ocd so i try not to however i am having trouble doing intuitive eating because i cant really tell when im hungry or full i end up eating almost nothing and then overeating the net balance has me maintaining my weight but in a pretty miserable manner i have trouble telling if im hungry unless im ravenous or if im lightheaded cant focus etc i have trouble telling if im full unless im overlyfull but then im uncomfortable im hyposensitive in some of my other senses could this be the same thing has anyone else delt with this or does anyone have any advice,post-pandemic

im 21 years old i have 35 year experience as a carpenter and i also have my real estate license i live in a small town that has a housing crisis and the cost of living is extremely high i lived in this town for 3 years after moving here to get away from my family and have something of my own had a truck and a great job with a mentor teaching me a lot about my trade but also about life in general i earned two raises within my first year and was making 70k a year i had a l lot of personal hardship in the beginning but got through the worst of it after meeting a girl weve been together for 2 years our relationship feels like we are already married we have the mentality of us against the world but we both really want to good thing for othersespecially youth going through what we did we both had troubling and violent childhoods but came through it with mindsets of growth i became a volunteer for the red cross to try and help people in my community but i couldnt dedicate much time besides installing fire alarms in homes and attending trainings i got cpraedfirstaid certified through them as well i wish i couldve done more but i needed to pay the bills i also attended trade classes and got a 40hour residential wood framing cert im always trying to better myself through education its become a pillar of my values since i was a young boy i realized acquiring skills was what gave me opportunities a year ago i was severely injured in a crash nearly losing my thumb it healed fine with no complicationsjust an ugly scar my truck was constantly failing and needed costly repairs interfering with my dependability then going to get some groceries my tire snapped off after 2600 worth of repairs on the front end 3 months prior and was nearly in a terrible accident luckily had enough control to slide to the shoulder of the road and was unscathed i was only going 35mph it was during a rainstorm so maybe that was a factor i found philosophy at this time and my truck failing was easy to accept at the time since i already knew it had problems and i didnt have much control over it my self esteem kept taking hits due to my lack of dependability but my boss was very supportive i always tried to be honest about my situation but it all felt like my fault and like i was making excuses for myself my work ethic was probably the only thing that kept me around my girlfriend graciously let me borrow her car for work and luckily she worked next to my ongoing project and it wasnt a huge inconvenience then her car started failingelectrical and i started paying for its repairs since i felt responsible then i decided to walk to work and carry my belt a tools every morning my gf reassured me the problems with the car wasnt my fault but i kept walking because it felt good for my mental health i showed up super early for months and rolled out to compensate for my absences at work i finally broke when my girlfriend car stalled in the road 3 miles from my work and i sprinted to help her i checked her oil and got it back home that was the last straw and told my boss i need time to take care of the car i had to work for my landlord who really needed help finishing his side of the property to cover rent finished several rooms and he forgave the lost rent money this is all around when i got my re license paying dues after a year of prelicensing we have been doing fine and getting by and my landlord liked my work and payed me a normal wage even when behind on rent but now its been four months of job hunting and i keep getting ghosted or they never come to fruition its killing my self esteem and my suicidal ideation is getting worse havent talked to my previous boss since i left but gave him a timeline for when i could return but he ran out of work before i could come back im now too embarrassed to reach out again i feel like a garbage carpenter and i have no business being a realtor i got my license for my own education on the process and thought it would be helpful in my dreams of building beautiful and sustainable homes not because i thought it would get me rich quick we are trying to move somewhere with better opportunities but this hurdle is making it impossible im snapping at my partner more often and constantly apologizing i feel like i am failing her and myself i dont wont to end up like my drug addict parents but dont see the light i called the help line but got embarrassed i cant afford therapy and public mental health services are so backed up i have a history of cutting selfharm and depression from my teenage years but abstained after going through several institutions its coming back into my thoughts after all of this and i dont know how to cope anymore i really want to die i dont have family to help since theyre vindictive or incapable ill do anything to get a job that can support us but this town is a government and healthcare heavy community so i cant even qualify i will say i am glad to have my gf i love our pets and i am grateful for my skills being useful enough to cover rent im sorry this is so long i just needed to say it somewhere thank you for reading and i hope things are going better for you all god bless,post-pandemic

technically they arent on the spectrum but they have pretty much the samesimilar struggles and very often dont fit in to society so are they nt plus there are plenty of other disorders that would make someone have the same struggles of an autistic person are they neurotypical too you see this is the problem i have with the word why cant we just use allistic to avoid confusion googles definition of neurotypical is used for people who dont have autism or other neurologically atypical patterns of thought or behavior which includes people with spd and adhd to me but apparently not to many other people were kinda leaving a big part of our community out arent we what do you think,pre-pandemic

i have recently been having trouble controlling my heart rate this past friday it was around 170 my therapist recommended that i go to the hospital its not the first time i go to the hospital for my heart rate but it was the first time it was lasting what felt like a long time at the hospital they did ekg blood tests and chest xray all came back normal flash forward to today my heart is beating fast not as fast as friday but fast nonetheless i have been feeling my heart rate for about 3 hrs and its really freaking me out i honestly dont know what to do any tips,post-pandemic
is it better to get diagnosed and start treatment then choose career paths or the other way around i was thinking if you structure your life while youre suffering you can be in the jobs that suits your strengths and then when you medicate you can excel more but if you get diagnosed first you are always more reliant on medication example hvac tech with adhd still works better than everybody unmedicated project manager needs medication otherwise cant manage and deliver projects but has a higher paying and no labour tell me your thoughts on this,post-pandemic
i was just prescribed prazosin for nightmares and this is my fourth day on it the first three nights were perfectly peaceful and last night i had one nightmare but not as bad as in the past note i have cptsd from abusive childhoodboarding schoolabusive relationships in my 20s so ive always had nightmares but ptsd night terrors started after my ex trigger warning raped me in october 2020 after i had broken up with him and was dating someone else i went over to his house to pick up a few boxes of my things and he triggered me then took advantage of me even after i said no over and over and that i had a boyfriend so i have two questions for anyone on prazosin with ptsd nightmares question one when you first started taking it did you wake up feeling like you had travelled back in time to before the acute event that gave you ptsd my first night on prazosin i woke up in the morning and felt in a peculiarly specific way like i had travelled back in time i woke up refreshed and felt hope innocence as specifically if i was back in 20202021 like happy and fresh to be in new york without all this heaviness of gloom and doom that clings to me now as if i want to walk outside and explore the city and am still in love or excited about the guy i was dating then i havent felt that exact feeling in the mornings since but ive felt rested and like sleep is a safe place again i realized today in therapy that this time travel feeling i got is located on my personal timekine right before my ex boyfriend rped me after which i began to have ptsd night terrors nightmares and became terrified of sleep throwing up from stress when i woke up etc question two did the drug start wearing off at any point whenhow often did nightmares start coming back again last night was night four for me on prazosin i had the first stressful dream since taking the drug although not as bad as nightmares in the past i dreamed my friend was driving a cargo van that i was sitting in and she accidentally drove it into a frozen river the van was sinking and she and the other passenger got out but left me behind in plain sight where i couldnt climb out on my own this same friend actually has scared me with her driving before and left me behind when i was kholed at a music festival this fall when she promised shed stick around til it wore off so theres a basis in reality then i dreamed that i was swimmingflying in the air over the river and that alligators were jumping up to get me and one caught my hand and lost some teeth in my flesh before i fully escaped i woke up and my thumb was throbbing i half expected to see the teeth in it still tldr prazosin made me feel like i time travelled to the time before the event that gave me acute ptsd but might be losing effect after 4 days,post-pandemic
wondering if anyone else has done this before within the last id say month or so ive gone from not normal eating but eating nonetheless to not feeling hungry thirsty anything im not sure if im just no longer realizing what these feelings mean like when my stomach hurts i just think oh i have a stomach ache my first thought isnt oh i need to eat like it typically is my throat has always had an issue being overly dry since i got my tonsils out almost two years ago so i typically am constantly drinking tons and tons of water i genuinely think ive had maybe 6 oreos over the past 48 hours my concern is its getting worse but i kind of also want it to get worse if that makes sense i dont know this is more of a rant rave discussion just generally getting it out there into a space that im hoping is safe since its been a few years since ive even bothered getting on reddit let alone this thread so i guess my question is does anyone else have any clue as to what physical issues could cause lack of appetite and thirstsignaling of those two things to your brain or whatever because its just getting annoying at this point its either eat weird quote on quote or eat too much hopefully this makes sense im also using talk to text because im fighting a pretty wicked headache but thought why not in the midst of it post here thanks in advance for anything like advice or otherwise,post-pandemic

hello i have a few questions regarding the supposed diagnosis i was given my psychiatrist originally diagnosed me with schizophrenia for whatever reason but now changed it to prepsychoticor prepsychosis i do not believe i am psychotic in any capacity whether psychotic or prepsychotic but i fail to understand what is meant by prepsychotic i an supposedly not psychotic enough to be diagnosed with schizophrenia but was deemed to psychotic to take part in a study of those deemed being at an heightened risk of becoming psychotic eg prodromal psychosis equally they threaten me with institutionalisation if i do not take medication despite prepsychosis not being a formal medical condition hence either they are utterly disorganised and do not know their own terminology or they are describing something else by the term i do not have any negative symptoms nor any classical prodromal symptoms the most i can think of is a greatly disordered sleep pattern but beyond that i demonstrate no real negative symptomatology i have normal affect i have energy i appear normal for my standards i always were a little uncomfortable with social interaction which persists to date i am not sad apathetic i am not paranoid nor referential i may have had periods of such states but these are few in between and never were of any concern to me or anyone else regarding psychotic like symptoms i also like the most common symptoms i am rarely paranoid i have no magical thinking i have no referential idea i have no hallucinations and my speech is no more diagnosed than it always has been i have a speech impediment hence my speech can be a little jumbled at times but always has been to my actual symptoms though the most distressing and that which makes me the most personal suffering arent even classically psychotic i have hour long ruminative phases daily everyday about the most irrelevant often hypothetical or bizarre things which threaten my ideas of perfection such as pondering the hierarchical nature of things in irritation trying to categorise hypothetical creatures into tight categories of supremacy eg if aliens existed where in the hierarchical nature of creature superiority would hey be and how can i explain why humans would always be on topgetting worked up about possible scenarios related to my body and what i would then have to do to retain my perfection in response to these offences to me eg if tumours grow out my head who could i cover myself up to maintain a perfect self beyond that i have what they describe grandiose and bizarre delusions i have that ability to believe what i want whenever i want when it suits me hence i tend to deny whatever i dont like from past actions to scientific facts i retain the ability to understand on some level that im just lying but it is true enough to me that it takes the distress off me and calms me and makes me somewhat functional again but these reisieintricste rumination and often backup plans to really keep the stress off they can influde also just very fanatical and grandiose themes like claiming to be flawless and supreme to boost my ego but i retain the ability to grasp that i am making up stuff it just seems more superficial hence i still believe it in some other level beyond that violent and rather gruesome thoughts make up the rest they arent distressing and rather play into my self esteem the themes can be anything really from cannibalism to other gruesome ideas no distress or disgust to the thoughts themselves and are rather indulged distress may arise though when the continuation of these thoughts is inhibited and feelings of weakness arise that said i dont see how this relates to psychosis and whenever i try to mention it i am not taken serious hence i wonder if i am just mistaken or if i genuinely am in the right here and should do the lengthy effort to find a second opinion which is hard in my position i am sorry for be in being lengthy,post-pandemic
for the past couple years my health anxiety was terrible i would constantly think about my heart and other random shit about my body wondering if i was gonna die it affected me everyday and there were many times when i was out doing something i had to physically leave because i was so anxious about my health since about a month ago my health anxiety is nonexistent i beat it and it feels amazing to have my life back i recently found this sub and i empathize so much with the people here because i experienced the same things i know how much it sucks hopefully this posts helps some people preface im getting a lot of this information out of napoleon hills think and grow rich he talks about what he calls the fear of ill health and his knowledge of the subject cured all my anxiety im gonna summarize whats said in the book the mind as im sure most of you know health anxiety is all created in the mind this means that the mind is the only thing that can cure health anxiety also understand your mind is extremely powerful and completely connected to your body in ways we cant explain your health anxiety has nothing to do with your body and everything to do with your mind your mind and thoughts can affect your body in almost any way you let it this is why health anxiety causes panic attacks and can even make you feel symptoms of the condition youre anxious about luckily we can control our mind and thoughts therefore we can control and eliminate health anxiety the fear of ill health the fear of ill health is traced to physical and social heredity its closely tied to the fear of death which ill touch on because it leads us into places we dont know but imagine to be terrible in main we fear ill health due to the terrible pictures that have been put into our minds if death should overtake us this is the root cause of your health anxiety hypochondria is the habit of thinking about an illness concentrating the mind upon the disease and expecting its appearance until a nervous condition appears this is what your health anxiety is its all created in your thoughts and mind the mind is very powerful it either builds or destroys us do not let your thoughts destroy you in the form of health anxiety the fear of death fearing death is pointless death is inevitable for everyone you must accept death as a necessity and pass it out your mind it must be necessary or it would not come at all and if it is necessary which it is perhaps it is not as bad as you may think the entire world is made of two things matter and energy from elementary school we learn that neither matter nor energy the only two realities known can ever be created or destroyed both matter and energy can be transformed but never destroyed life if anything is energy if neither matter nor energy can be destroyed then life can never truly be destroyed life like many other forms of energy may passed through phases of transition and change but never truly destroyed death is a mere transition even if death is not a mere change at its worst it will be a long and peaceful sleep and sleep is nothing to be feared thus we can wipe out the fear of death forever how to get over your worry relieve yourself of the fear of death by accepting that death is an inescapable event accepting this is a big step to beating health anxiety eliminate the fear of ill health by ignoring your symptoms whenever you think you have a symptom just think to yourself i ignore my symptoms no matter what it is think i ignore my symptoms x200b understanding the above information and thinking i ignore my symptoms whenever something comes up has given me my life back i hope this helps someone,pre-pandemic
hi guys i never usually post in these types of groups but im at a point now where i think i need to a bit of a backstory i have gad i have suffered from extreme panic attacks since i was about 12 im now about to turn 22 i have been on medication since then what i am about to mention may trigger some recently with the state of the world wars climate change etc my anxiety has been at an all time high i am constantly shaking having nightmares upset stomach i pretty much think im dying 247 i have always been an activist for the environment and world peace but i am just a regular joe person with no power to change significant world issues i understand i cannot control everything the lack of control and wanting to save the world is terrifying i have tried everything to calm myself research positive thinking talking to family therapy and i cannot get out of my own head how do i stop this i am physically and mentally exhausted feeling as if theres nothing positive anymore if anyone has any tips or even positive news id love to hear it,post-pandemic
ive posted about this book before on rptsd but it helped me so much i think it bears reposting the book came out in 2015 so its relatively new it was written by a psychologist who attempted to treat ptsd in vietnam veterans in the early 1970s and has been trying to understand trauma of all forms for his entire career it is written partly as a description of his career and the technological developments that helped doctors understand trauma but it also goes into great detail describing the physical mechanisms of trauma and how to overcome them and yes you can overcome them i have ptsd from a near death experience that landed me in a 9 day medically induced coma in trying to recover i kept meeting people talking about energy or memories living in our muscles and it just always felt confusing or vague and even more disempowering this book really demystified a lot of these concepts for me and helped me believe for the first time that not only were my problems understandable but that there were practical things that i could do to move beyond them,pre-pandemic

whenever im very productive during a manic episode while understanding im manic i feel like life is okay and everything is finally getting better i get a ton of motivation and think im going to accomplish everything that i want and need to recently i bought a meal planner a cleaning chores chart and started using my regular yearly planner one evening i just went ham on thinking of and writing down every possible thing i needed or wanted to do i wrote tasks on every day of the week until there was no more space to write something else and the problem with my extensive to do lists is that theyre unrealistic i never give myself enough time to do stuff maybe because im not very patient with myself i try to plan all of my tasks for a single day instead of spreading them out sometimes i actually do finish many tasks in one day and it feels nice to check things off my list so then i continue to think more highly of myself and my abilities which makes me create more tasks for my list inevitably that productivity and motivation will go away my baseline state is pretty depressed meaning that my depressive episodes are quite awful anyway since im usually depressed i basically set my future self up for failure when im over productive not only do i feel depressed but also unstable i definitely have some sort of completion obsession meaning if i believe that i cant finish every single task on my list i will not even start or attempt anything on that list the thing i hate most about all this is the waste it generates it wastes my time i spend several hours doing all this planning and frivolous stuff and never actually doing something it wastes my energy my brain stops functioning at some point because im trying to catch up to my racing thoughts it wastes my money a lot of us definitely spend more money during manic episodes and my most recent experience with this is the main reason why im making this post i was very broke recently but i got paid and have been able to be more comfortable spending some money after i got paid i felt extremely motivated to start meal prepping and planning it would definitely help me save some money planned out all my meals for a week but it was very last minute before the beginning of the work week so i hadnt even gone shopping for ingredients by the time sunday night came and went i convince myself i will shop on monday didnt happen i actually did go shopping the next day but i got home from the grocery store at 1030 pm not enough time to prep any meals at all so i convince myself i will cook on wednesday didnt happen its friday night now and nope did not cook if i dont quickly cook or eat these ingredients they will expire and rot which is usually what happens whenever im like this if i have to throw away the food because i couldnt cook in time that is really a huge waste of food this next part is kind of a paradox for me my trip to the grocery store this time was reasonable only 125 for a great amount of not just food but some hygienic products as well where i live it is cheaper to cook your own meals rather than order out so i did a great job saving money on that right no because the food that i never even touched had to get thrown away so in reality that is now around 100 wasted venting but want to hear everyones experiences with this sort of thing also any advice on how to mitigate this type of behavior fyi im trying to get an ocd evaluation because parts of this are not bipolar acting alone thanks yall,post-pandemic
so my health anxiety is almost entirely grounded in cancer today im worried about lymphoma and brain cancer a month ago it was lung and digestive cancers before that leukemia and before that bone cancer you get the gist my dad was diagnosed with cancer and did pass away from it before you freak out he was older active but poor poor diet his whole life history of alcoholism i mention this because its good context for my issues my health anxiety spirals every year around this time janmar when he was sick even though i know many many statistics about age of diagnosis and general health and this and that it doesnt always stop the worrying as many of you are well aware i tend to catastrophise if i feel bad it must be cancer and since its cancer ill die a painful death in a couple months i typically avoid cancer stories as they trigger me up pretty badly duh but today i stumbled across a story of a 27 year old guy who was diagnosed with a rare brain cancer a few months ago today he announced he was cancerfree the world isnt perfect and it isnt always fair there are lots of what ifs but i think its so so so important to remember the what ifs are conjecture and not fact so you go through the thing your lymph nodes are swollen youre probably a little sick with a cold or maybe youve been poking your neck non stop for weeks to check so you probably dont have lymphoma okay but what if you do honestly youd probably be fine this is not always the case but if we go by percentages 99 of your worries are not cancer or malignant or serious at all 75 of that 1 of real and serious conditions respond well to treatment theres variance but this is a great time in history to have cancer treatments are so plentiful and effective maybe you do have brain cancer but so that 27 year old kid did hes alive and well to be abundantly clear i think its most important to challenge false conclusions first and foremost challenge your worries if youre in a rut though and you just cant shake the feeling that this time is has to be cancer i just know it has to be stay optimistic we are a community of worriers challenge yourself to think of best case scenarios even if theyre within the worst case im here with you if youre scared of something today and im so positive that we will get through it just fine i want you to be positive of that as well,pre-pandemic

i feel very insecure i think i overheard my coworker talking about me but im not 100 sure i feel like a spectacle i always feel like ppl dont take me serious or like im an object also i work at a restaurant and im a server so i decided to wear makeup and specifically a shade of red lipstick so friday and saturday night i wore this new lipstick i bought just for work this one table of four with an older couple and a younger couple sat in my section the older couple and i think theyre daughter were shocked and laughing at me and shocked at me being their server the dad even asked me it was very weird and my coworkers brother and his gf has been coming to eat at the restaurant consistently first it started off as just visiting her outside but now they sit and eat why does he stare me down every time right in front of everyone i would be less offended if it wasnt in front of his gf do i find him physically attractive yes its a confusing feeling i think this type of thing happens a lot i want a relationship but all these guys want is sex its always a guy in a relationship and that kinda triggers something in me it feels like men dont think im good enough for a serious relationship and tbh this even seems to happen with friends and i try to bring up serious things but they dont listen,post-pandemic

when i was roughly 1516 years old id occasionally turn around to see people laughing just by looking at my face this developed social anxiety in me and fast forward 20 years i still have it i still to this day occasionally see someone laughing at my face out of the corner of my eye and as it has developed a bad case of social anxiety over the years i have never had the guts to call anyone out on it and ask them why they are laughing i have also had people say things like sorry but i just cant help but laugh at your face so i know all this isnt in my head ive tried therapy many times recording myself to see if there is anything funny looking about me i havent been able to notice anything reading self help books and generally trying to just not give a fuck but ultimately i return back to severe social anxiety and avoid all types of socializing other than at work i just want to get my life back on track now and start socializing and not let this dominate everything does anyone have any ideas on how i could do this or has anyone had a similar experience,post-pandemic

every conversation i have had about suicide in recent memory with mental health professionals or volunteers has included variations of the following have you considered listening to music have you considered going for a walk have you considered taking up a new hobby have you considered making new friends have you considered volunteeringgetting a job it happens every time it happens in every conversation it happened yesterday and it happened twenty minutes ago i finally summoned the courage to text a helpline for the first time because i just cant call one and this is the only help i received fuck yes fuck yes i have considered every possible option and opportunity to make me not imagine shooting a bullet in my skull or dragging a blade across my throat or tying a rope around my neck heres the problem it never works i have had meaningful employment and voluntary roles that i genuinely enjoyed i have socialised and met plenty of lovely people i have spent the last six years in a loving and nurturing relationship with a wonderful man i have taken long beautiful strolls in nature by the river i have fed the ducks and petted dogs and helped the elderly and looked after children i have listened to music and played the piano and sang my favourite songs the thing is i cant walk without imagining myself hurling my body in front of a car or drowning in the lake or lying on the train tracks i cant bake a cake from scratch without imagining myself plunging the kitchen knife into my wrists and bleeding out all over the counter i cant meet new people without withdrawing isolating myself and remembering that i am a burden i am a parasite i am worthless and i need to just die i cant trust anyone because i have been abused and broken and betrayed so profoundly that everyone feels like a potential threat the next predator i cant work or volunteer or commit to anything without my joints aching and my bones creaking without my mind spiralling and without my energy slipping away until i can barely move anymore i cant enjoy a hug with my boyfriend without imagining him choking the life out of me i cant do anything without wanting to die and picturing the multitude of ways i could end my life i could be having an amazing day and feel so much relief because wow for once i feel good the thoughts will linger in the background and watch they will creep a little closer and whisper in my ear and stand in front of me then climb inside my brain to remind me that they are still here that they will always be here no matter what i do to distract myself to find hope to find meaning im lost im lonely im alienated im tired it is so difficult to find people who understand because try not to kill yourself is not a part of everyones daily routine its not on everyones todo list i have considered everything i have tried everything and i still want to die every fucking day edit thank you all so much for your kindness and support it means so much i am working my way through the replies to this post and a previous post it might take time because i have a lot of messages but i will reach you all one by one thank you 3,pre-pandemic

really i promise when it comes to chronic illness a lot of the time people always try to only focus on positivity i dont let bipolar beat me i wont let bipolar keep me from doing what i love ill fight hard every day theres definitely a core of truth to maintaining a positive attitude throughout this disease but i also find that too often it comes at the expense of not allowing yourself to feel the bad parts because sometimes acknowledging that youre not okay when it comes to bipolar feels like a huge personal failure like you werent trying hard enough like you should have known and done better because how can you keep up with being positive if you let the negative interfere i want you all to know that its so very much okay to not be okay youre allowed to feel frustrated stressed and tired youre allowed to be fed up with this shit youre allowed to curse at bipolar and the ignorance spread about our condition were finite and were human this shit wears us down bipolar disorder is really hard and thats okay it would be weird if this stuff didnt negatively impact us dont get caught in the positivity trap where you only allow yourself to feel positive things because you have to or else you dont have to be positive all the time its super important for us to feel these frustrations and all the other bullshit so we can process them rather than push them aside and bottle them up until they cave in on us doing so is known to help prevent burnout and makes for happier healthier people give yourself the space and time to feel the bad stuff be sad cry punch things at the gym go for a long and lonely walk yell play violent games listen to heavy metal bitch at friends do all these things so you dont get stuck pent up in the background and unable to move forward youll feel so much better if you give yourself permission to feel these things take a nap or go to bed for the night afterwards and when you wake up reflect and plan why were you feeling this way can you trace it back to one specific event or does it feel like an accumulation of many things are you setting reasonable expectations for yourself or are you holding yourself to a really high standard that is setting you up for failure be honest with yourself and your expectations once you have answered these kind of questions you have processed the emotions attached to the situation at least partially a better understanding of whats going on to make you feel this way or clues to follow up on in the next step to figure that out the ability to start planning on ways to make things easier for you remember to take it one step at a time focus on what you can do be kind to yourself you deserve it its okay to not have the answer to fix your most pressing issues whats important is to make a list and go down it and deal with each item one piece at a time can you delegate x obligation thats stressing you out do it can you skip or reassign chores to make things fairer and less burdensome do it can you set reminders on your phone to remember your injections or mealtimes do it one thing at a time as important as it is to acknowledge the bad please also celebrate your accomplishments even if its just a small thing that everyone else does all the time if you struggled with it but you did it anyway you should be proud of that achievement dont measure yourself by what others do bipolar and chronic illness is about you nobody else you are your own standard you do what you can without hurting yourself and that is at all times excellent its important to understand that trying our best is all we can ask from ourselves and that trying your best doesnt mean you have to break yourself in the process youre valuable youre capable youve got this even when things are bad youre no less worthy of love support and care its okay to not be okay,pre-pandemic
currently im sitting in my school bathroom skipping my band class i have an anxiety disorder and i dont know what it is but i have such a hard time attending that class im able to come in late without repercussions due to the iep i have but it seems to do nothing for me in this class the teacher is very passive aggressive and seems to draw attention to me every single time i come in late like pointing me out in the middle of class stopping me from playing etc i honestly really like playing but ive been skipping so much class because i dont want to face that teacher and my emotions keep piling up does anyone have any advice or were in a similar situation,post-pandemic
i am social anxious and i am afraid of expressing my real thoughts problems and emotions to people i usually wear a mask pretending i am someone i am not just to be liked i dont speak much because i am over analyzing the other person and calculating in my head the right thing to say the right thing to say but not the real thing to say or what i really think and feel i sometimes i act as a chameleon around others so i wont stand out i think i wear a mask because maybe deep down i dont like the real me and i think that maybe if people hurt me at least they are not hurting me they are hurting the mask but also if they like me they are liking a fake me so neither hurt or love can truly get to me does it make any sense,post-pandemic

anyone else feel intensely lonely my only friend stopped talking to me my mom and i are out of our house currently at my aunts house because of a domestic violence dispute were waiting on a court protective order against my dad so we can safely go back my cousins are brothers and came home for the weekend theyre so close and i miss so badly having a sibling their parents are super chill and also rich its like they won the jackpot in life they have the money success in their respective fields great friends and a loving and close knit family even though my brother made fun of me and we wouldnt do many things together wed sometimes go out and see a movie or eat dinner my cousins went out to eat by themselves and im eating dinner with my aunt and uncle its fine but i intensely miss having someone to talk to my age especially something like a sibling or friend bond i dont even know how to describe how intensely lonely i feel on a daily basis and even more since my brother unalived himself i just want to be included and loved thats all ive ever wanted in life funny thing is i always try to make other people included because i know how horrible it feels to be left out or an afterthought it was super painful to be left out when my cousins ordered breakfast went out to work out and eat lunch and now theyve gone out to dinner theyre nice people and well exchange pleasantries but nothing deeper than that we used to hang out more when we were younger obviously but they mostly keep to themselves and each other after they got rich we dont hang out even though we live so close and when theyre home i know most people would probably not care but it hurts when i had to move away from my childhood home to be close to family after my brother died and i guess the only person who benefitted was my mom since her siblings live here she has a sister the aunt who loves her so much they do almost everything together the only thing that keeps me going is if there is an afterlife or a heaven or reincarnation i hope i can finally be with my soul family and be surrounded by love i dont know why im so deprived of love in this lifetime but thats probably the only time ill not feel lonely,post-pandemic
i keep having dreams of twirling a meth pipe i can feel the taste in my mouth and the anticipation of the high as i inhale then i wake up disappointed its been the 4th dream always the same i havent used meth in 2 years before that it was 1 year 2018 was my last 3 month binge my life is going really good i know i can go get some down the road and be high for 2448hrs even be a little productive and then possibly not do it again for months but i know that the depression and anxiety that will follow is just not worth it and the cravings will just intensify next time what do yous normally do in this situation i cant really reach out to anyone as they have no idea about this issue ive dealt with in my life my cousin would understand but he passed away three months ago,post-pandemic
i cant do this anymore no answer is a right answer every choice i could make leads to pain mine or others i get the feeling in my chest when the wave of realization hits meits an uncomfortable dissipation of hopelessness over my heart i hate it and yet its horrifically comforting but its also tragic because ive never been able to follow through i get that feeling that realization that there is no hope that theres no right answer and if i could just not exist all the pain would end it makes me want to hit something when i get this feeling while knowing i can never seem to act on it its so frustrating but i dont have the energy to lash out i just sit with the discomfort and shame and profound sadness and nothing changes i can get up and go to work tomorrow but that starts off yet another week where i am just holding on until i get to the weekend and have no responsibilities but thats untruethe work responsibilities end but the responsibilities to family or friends begin specifically responsibility to my husband who i am separated from we have been trying to figure out how to stay together he doesnt accept no to our relationship as an answer but he also doesnt accept how i am or what i need or more accurately the pace i am on and the ambiguity of my situation i am useless i am detrimental i am in pain why stay here and yet i havent been able to end it i need to just pull the plug i wish i could find the strength to just end it,post-pandemic

hey all i never expected myself to be afraid of social interactions but here we are im 21m and an active member of a universitys sports team id always considered myself an extrovert especially after joining the team and up until recently i really enjoyed talking to some of the newer players and made quick friends with a number of them however quite recently i received some criticism from my captains saying that i very often picked the wrong time to initiate conversations such as when everybody was tired they also described me as being pushy or overlyfriendly which may instead push people away from me the fact that i am on the autism spectrum does not help since i struggle with social cues right now i struggle with overthinking about social interactions and am afraid of talking to my friends beforeafter training for fear of annoying them with my friendliness or chattiness is there anything i can do about the situation thank you,post-pandemic
sorry this is kind of a late update ive been so busy for context here is the original post here i remember lots of people asking for an update so here it is sorry if this sounds a little off english is my third language i listened to what everyone said and i really really appreciated the advice after taking the time to calm down i screenshotted all of his emails to show how he was lying and changing my grade he changed it 6 different times to make it seem like i was failing even more and trying to manipulate me into retaking his course as well as emails where he contradicts things that he had told me in the past i attached all those screenshots to a long long email calling him out professionally as well as explaining my side of things i also went as far as rhetorically questioning a lot of his statements in an effort to emphasize how callous and unreasonable he was being so that not only can he process exactly what hes been telling me and reflect on it but also for others reading the email as well i attached my disability counsellor him the chair running the department and the coordinator of the program within an hour he sent a rushed email saying he didnt want to deal with this then another email an hour later trying to save himself i didnt say anything and let the emails sit 2 days later i received an email back from him saying he was talked to by his bosses and that theyve decided to pass me for his class along with an apology for how insensitive and harsh he was being yay so glad i stood up for myself this time and i encourage anyone else to 100 do the same thanks everyone,pre-pandemic

okay so basically ive been having hearth palpitations for 3 years now everything started when i was 17 few years ago i decided to visit hearth doctor which did all the exams and said that im fine theres nothing to be worried about theres no risk for anything bad to happen which doesnt seem 100 sure to me my current health or idk how should i say it i feel anxious 247 like wtf i dont feel like anything that i do that stresses me but i just have that feeling that something is wrong with me 100 my family doctor is also tired of me always complaining about my hearth for the last 3 years nevertheless she started to tell me that its just anxiety and she says that every time i ask what should i do about those palpitations she just keeps bragging that i should stay calm exercise etc few months ago i went to her again and asked should i go to a psychologist which she agreed with me long story short went to psychologist she said i should try doing some breathing exercises well okay 2 months passed nothing helped and im thinking right now theres one weird thing with me like i dont believe that breathing could help me which my doctor says differently everything is in our mind but the thing is when doctor told me to do those exercises i was 100 sure they wont which is just like i said now do you guys have the same thing like someone tells that it will work but you think about 1000 different possibilities like for example some people believe in god right well they always brag about how their health started to be better after they started to believe in him and they also have more energy etc well me being 1000iq i always say to myself example you only feel better because you believe that god exists and then i just cant believe in god just simply becausei always think that its just in your brain and that god doesnt exist its only your imagination which makes you feel better because you believe that god exists or in any other thing like i always think that im ahead of people 100 times and they dont understand what im trying to say does anyone understand what im talking about i dont know what should i do where should i go this is just making me crazy please help people,post-pandemic

ive been dealing with a constant anxiety for about 2 years now i have always been an introvert but now its like a horrible fear of leaving my house because people are outside a lot has changed since i started feeling this way ive stopped going to restaurants with my boyfriend and we probably havent done anything fun since we went to a concert in october of course this leads to a tenseness in the relationship which only gives me more anxiety its horrible but i drink at least every other night just to calm my nerves the tiniest bit i just feel like my symptoms are eating me alive this is on another topic but my parents and i pretty much stopped all contact with each other after i turned 16 im 22 now 3 days ago my mom asked me to go to lunch with her so obviously i knew something was up she told me my dad might have blood cancer i know nothing about this but cancer runs in my family horribly both grandparents on my dads side have passed from it im terrified of losing my dad because we missed the past 6 years together but im even more scared to actually pick up the phone and get ahold of him i have no idea what to say and my heart starts beating so hard i sweat i shake all while just thinking about trying to talk to him i dont know what im looking for here but im stuck in a horrible fucking limbo and i cant make myself do anything i dont want to even when i want to i feel like no one relates to this because most people would pick up the phone instantly if their loved one was in danger or whatever but i feel like im drowing in a very shallow well rn where do i start,post-pandemic
even on subreddits like raskdocs seldom does an actual doctor that specializes in your conditions illness post most often it is grade schoolers high schoolers and god forbid premed students playing dr house in some cases youll get med students but they arent doctors either i fell into a 3 month long depression because i posted on raskdocs on my throwaway for me it was a red patch on my tongue with some white in and around it i posted a picture of it and everyone diagnosed it as you know what i am not surprised if you google this you will see the only possible conditions are what you would expect c word when i went to see the doctor he laughed at the notion of it being that and immediately diagnosed me with stomach issues he saw the evidence of acid reflux in my mouth and referred me to a gi specialist i made some life style changes quit smoking stopped drinking juice at night made sure to eat no less than 3 hours before sleeping etc within a few months all evidence of that illness in my mouth went away not a single person in my thread mentioned anything about gi issues even google provided no hits for gi issues which is probably why no one said anything since all people do on reddit is just google your symptoms and read back the same shit you read and frightened yourself with the only issue that came up that wasnt the c word was geographic tongue but my doctor says this is very often misdiagnosed especially in people with gi issues andor on antibiotics once i started looking into gi issues and how it manifests on the tongue i found many people talking about their strange tongues and even finally found a person who posted a pic of their tongue that looked just like mine on one of the gi issue subreddits no less and he was also diagnosed with gi issues hours and weeks of research never once revealed this benign condition that i had if it had i would have immediately known because i had been waking up with stomach pain every day for the better part of a year had even awoken in the middle of the night a few times with what i thought was vomit in my mouth it was acid from acid reflux and constantly was using the washroom 5x a day,post-pandemic

hi i hope you are all good im going to share my story briefly and then jot 2 questions at the bottom you can skip to the questions if you want i have possibly developed residual schizophrenia due to a host of factors and neglecting medication for a long time for acute psychotic disorder about three years ago now so i have cognitive issues with thinking where i have an empty mind and difficulties thinking clearly without forcing it i have no positive symptoms of schizophrenia ive made great progress through healthy practices ie promoting joyous meditative states whilst listening to music positive imagerythoughts exercises like running drinking lots of water etc i can every now and then dight off these symptoms before i would fight them off and have relief from the cognitive symptoms for just 10 minutes or so now its 13 months of clearer thinking i always end up lapsing back into muddied thinking though so i have two questions in you guys experience in overcoming cognitive symptoms associated with schizophrenia how long have you managed to get your remission to last where you are near symptomfree and you can think clearly to what extent have you been able to minimise these cognitive symptoms in your case i can only see myself improving from here but id love to know how its been for yall with cognition specifically thanks,post-pandemic

i was laying on my bed when i realized for me the main thing about the way im bad with myself and everyone around me is that i dont have object permanence for how people view or feel about me they can tell me that they like me and enjoy me as a friend but that only lasts for a little bit afterwards just go back to not knowing how they would feel about me i stay up at night wondering if they hate me because theyre not responding or just feeling isolated and paranoid of everyone and asking others for reassurance that they are indeed okay with me i guess now i just need to work on that huh,post-pandemic

hi im 20 and have only recently seriously considered that i may be autistic after about 6 years of questioning several of my previous psychiatrists and therapists have brought up that some of my behavior and sensory issues could potentially be a sign that i may have asd however i initially denied this possibility with the reasoning being that i was previously tested for it when i was 10 years old and the results came back negative although i was noted to have noticeable sensory issues so that obviously means that i dont have it right recently i had my first appointment with both a new psychiatrist and therapist had to cause i moved and they both individually brought to my attention that based on my own descriptions as well as general observation that it could be possible that i have asd when i told my newest psychiatrist that i was tested and didnt have it she pointed out to me that since i only took that one test at a very young age some of my symptoms might not have been as noticeable as they are now and sometimes getting retested is recommended in such a case this earthshattering revelation has impacted me greatly and while part of me longs to receive an official diagnosis to be finally be able to rest easy knowing that im not just weird and actually get proper help for it i am very anxious about the potential cons to getting one for example my main fear is that if i get a formal diagnosis my friends family and peers will start treating me differently mainly im afraid ill either be infantilized very hard or looked down upon because of it tldr multiple doctors think i am possibly autistic would getting an official diagnosis for it actually be worth it or am i better off not pursuing it any advice would be very appreciated,post-pandemic

im not sure that im in the right place or if im an intruder here but i thought that asking people who deal from addiction would be the best way to find out for the passed 8 years ive rarely been sober longer than the first 8 hours im awake just long enough to get a shift in at work and maybe only 4560ish of those days were completely sober those rare sober days were usually due to me drinking smoking or sniffing my money away already its usually marijuana i smoke myself to oblivion well passed where i need to and keep smoking so i stay that way but its alcohol whenever the weed dries up and occationally its a 34 day coke bender note i do these almost exclusively alone not socially all that matters when i get home is that im not sober especially not for longer than a day or my headspace starts railing against itself its like somewhere in my brain something is always itching and if im sober too long my brain starts scraping against itself i just dont know if im an addict when i read what i just wrote i know its definitely not behavior to aspire to but ive heard addicts tell their truths and it feels like theyve dealt with something so much heavier and usually have an unilateral addiction to what most consider a heavier drug i feel like going to any sort of meeting is disrespectful to those whove had it so much worse ive never hit a rock bottom really my life has just never gone anywhere because im always messed up on something as soon as i clock out i spend 4060 of my income on substances and put off real life until tomorrow i put off family friends and even developing a relationship with my daughter its always tomorrow or next week ill do better but thats just what ill tell myself again the next day i guess my questions are is this addiction or am i just self medicating is this just me needing therapy or a 12 step is it disrespectful to even wonder this given what others deal with disclaimer i know weed is nonaddictive but i think its my bandaid to keep me off of the bottle or worse,post-pandemic

hey guys i know a lot of the folks in this sub are struggling with addiction every day and it sucks four months ago alcohol pretty much controlled my life i know that everyone is different and i cant speak to what you need on your journey with alcohol but i am hoping that me sharing this will speak to someone that was in a similar place that i was 4 months ago and maybe it can help i was drinking 23 bottles of wine a night or the equivalent in wine and vodka and woke up everyday feeling like complete shit id been abusing alcohol for awhile hiding my drinking sneaking tiny bottles of wine everywhere i was overweight my blood pressure was ridiculous and i have 4 kids and a beautiful wife i was listening to a podcast and heard about this book called this naked mind by annie grace i read the entire thing and i can honestly say that it completely changed my life and my view of alcohol in the first chapters the book had me write down exactly why i drink it was pretty crazy to look my reasons face to face and as uncomfortable as this is i wanted to share with you guys what i wrote i like the taste of beer it helps me deal with the craziness of 4 kids at 5pm it helps me forget the things im not looking forward to on the next day it helps me not worry so much about my health weight it helps me not worry so much in general it helps me be more outgoing not worry so much about what people think about me when socializing i like the camaraderie of drinking with other people i feel like it makes me a more fun dad i feel cool because i can drink hard liquor straight up i am proud of my ability to hold my booze and drink fast it helps me be present i like the ritual of going to the store everyday to get a drink maybe you can relate but these were the lies i was telling myself to justify my habit that was killing me i feel like i was promised by alcohol that it would deliver all these things and it probably did occasionally but the majority of the time it delivered nothing but hurt and pain alcohol lied to me and made me its bitch next i wrote out why i wanted to quit and when i first quit i just committed to 30 days i knew i could do anything for 30 days and told myself that id decide what to do after those 30 days based on how i felt here are the reasons i wrote out for quitting for 30 days im tired of waking up fuzzy headed and shakey im tired of trying to remember what happened the night before i want to lose weight i want to actually be healthy and not constantly worried that im going to die i dont feel normal i dont feel like myself i dont want to just endure my kids i want to enjoy them i want to be in control again im tired of thinking about alcohol so much and worrying how and when i can drink again i want to enjoy little things in life again like drawing or painting or crafts or woodworking i dont want to die young i want to see my kids grow up i want to succeed at know and love and have energy mindset to actually pursue it i want to be more proactive and excited at my job and invest in my team i didnt like what happened on st patricks day i drank way too much it was bad i can see my family members struggling with alcohol i dont want that i want to sleep better im so tired of worrying about what is or isnt working right in my body due to alcohol i want to not spend so much damn money on alcohol so we can pay off debt faster and buy a house this list along with the very compelling arguments against alcohol in the this naked mind book literally changed my brain im not sure how to explain it any other way but i have freedom last month i went on a work trip to an all inclusive resort for a week and didnt touch a drop of alcohol the best part is that i was happy the whole time i wasnt suffering and feeling like i was being punished because i now have and feel all of those things i wrote out above my health has improved drastically i sleep amazing ive lost 60 pounds i appreciate my family so much more i have new purpose and im moving forward in life and no drink or feeling that a drink gives me is worth trading all of that in thanks for reading my journey again i know everyone is different and there are so many factors with alcohol addiction i dont think this method of spontaneous sobriety can and should work for everyone but if you are questioning your relationship with alcohol and feel trapped i would suggest doing something dont waste anymore of this one beautiful and precious life you have being a slave to the lie that alcohol is needed there is so much freedom and joy on the other side feel free to message me if i can help you at all jason,pre-pandemic
so for years my wife who is somewhat ocpd and i have struggled to hold conversations when alone together we can talk about specific things without issue if necessary but just being and talking and connecting deeply is kind of a hot mess we talk but i never feel like we connect deeply to contrast this with another relationship i had with a wonderful gal who also had adhd she and i could sit or walk for literally hours and talk about nothing and yet everything under the sun barely a silent moment the conversation was always deep exciting flowed and we both understood exactly how and why we were talking about what we were talking about it was honestly amazing to watch it happen we would be talking about x and all of a sudden she would jump to topic c and i would know exactly how she got there and we would keep on going thirty minutes later she would just blurt out something and i would instantly know what she was referring to and how her mind jumped to that just now sadly for a lot of reasons outside our control that relationship didnt end up being who im married to but that emotional intimacy is what i need i feel so empty without it back to my marriage one of two things happens i either get emotionally exhausted trying to essentially carry the weight of the conversation for hours and keeping it moving or we have huge periods of time of silence and then one of us will talk about something but it feels very superficial and i dont feel it making a connection between us what can we do,post-pandemic

hey everyone ive been working on my health anxiety and one thing ive been curious about when you are able to get those negative thoughts out of your head what do you fill it with instead mindfulness and present moment helps to an extent but im looking for ideas on how to fill my mind with other healthy thoughts what do you think about,post-pandemic
hello folks some background i 31m have been suffering from health anxiety from last 8 months now i have been diagnosed with costochondritis chest pains it all started with me able to feel my heartbeat palpitations and later developed into full blown ha and then the chest pains obviously increased the health anxiety i stopped doing things that increased my heartbeat like running playing which i really used to enjoy first step was obviously visiting a doctor and getting all the tests done related to heart and chest i got it done twice because i was so anxious that what if the first doctor didnt do a proper diagnosis thankfully everything came all right but obviously the symptoms were still there and with chest pains i used to have random anxiety episodes this became an anxiety loop and i wasnt having proper sleep which was increasing the stress and then increasing the anxiety what i have been trying first thing i did was to visit a physiotherapist who helped me with some stretching exercises to help with my costo i have been doing it daily for the past 3 months and have been paying much more attention to my posture most of my work is behind the laptop and costo can aggravate due to bad posture costo is not completely gone but it has become manageable doing mindful relaxationmeditation i have been doing it almost 5 times a week on the insight timer app it has helped me by far the most among all the things helped with the general anxiety or anxious feelings general calmness slow breathing reduced stress etc my sleep also became better due to this which has a huge healing effect once your sleep gets better you will automatically feel calmness and less anxious if you do this then try to pick up a course rather than doing the same meditation daily they teach a lot of things including how to be kinder to yourself and to not judge or put yourself under pressure read the dare book by barry mcdonald and follow the practices he mentioned he has suggested some very simple practices and it really works he also suggests mindful relaxation along with multiple other things daily walks this has been life changing for me i started doing daily walks for 35mins1hour and it really took my mind off things try going out even if your mind says no force it few times and you will love it almost zero caffeine i never liked coffee too much so this was easy for me but reducing caffeine is very important drink lots of water along with all of the above my partner has really helped in the whole journey she listens to me and supports me which is really important where am i in the journey above stuff has been truly helpful and things are much more manageable for me right now compared to 6 months ago costo is not completely gone and other symptoms like palpitations feeling the heart beat etc are there but i have trying to live with it without getting stressed i trust that it will heal in its own time that time could be months years but i have accepted this truth that i need to have patience things will happen at their own pace and i should try to be happy calm and live the life everyone has their challenges and life throws ups and downs but there is no option but to navigate it how you react to those challenges is more important than the challenge itself remember there will be setbacks lot of them in fact i just had one setback yesterday but it wasnt as bad as before i was able to get through it in a much better manner without worrying too much life is a journey and not an event so dont let this even define you you will be fine just have patience and keep trying want to add that i have tried lot of other things too but some didnt work and thats fine it will happen and different things work for people but do try things then only you will know what works for you hope this helps someone,post-pandemic

gelotophobia is also known as a fear of laughter or being laughed at since gelotophobia is a relatively new concept gelotophobes may have received other diagnoses such as specific phobias or general social anxiety disorder a person suffering from gelotophobia may hear a strangers laugh and believe it is aimed at him or her they have a fear of being ridiculed and unfortunately often cannot distinguish playful teasing from ridicule gelotophobes either do not understand what laughter is or they think it is directed at them in a negative malicious way and feel scared when they hear it i think this is what i actually have who else,post-pandemic
well results are back from the mri that i insisted on due to memory and other various symptoms drum roll im not wrong im not being a hypochondriac its not my bipolar i have encephalomalacia brain damage due to a stroke ya know something turns out youre not being a hypochondriac if your right and there really is something wrong guys and gals if you know something is really wrong be your own advocate fight those fuckers argue complain beg if you have to if you know something is wrong now that i know that the mental impairments are permanent im pretty bummed out but we can try to prevent another stroke next time i hear the phrase youre too young to have that problem i will respond with so what you are telling me doc is you havent had enough experience in your field to realize its not only possible but warrants investigation please tell me im mistaken update the kind of stroke i had was a hemorrhagic stroke aka cerebral hemorrhage im hunting down a neurologist to see if there is anything they can do but my prognosis looks grim its degenerative with each stroke killing more of my brain 38 of us survive the first year it drops to 24 at five years oh today is my birthday i made it to 44 happy birthday to me most likely i wont see my son graduate high school or see my daughter get married my wife called me from work wished me happy birthday and we agreed that we should start getting my affairs in order i dont know what else to say i thought of something to say shittyprolifetip while being part of a sub that has suicidal people assert dominance by dying of natural causes sorry trying to be funny i laughed while i cried,pre-pandemic
this sub has helped me through a lot of health concerns but today im finally in a place where i can deal with it on my own so im posting to hopefully help someone else i started off as a mess and eventually got a full heartbody checkup including an mri and wore a heart monitor for 24hours to check out my palpitations after being told that everything is fine that was a big step getting a professional comprehensive medical diagnosis to rule out what youre worried about goes a long way after chest pains numbness tingling in my limbs dizzy spells being sent to the er because urgent care thinks i might be having a stroke and a ton of other shit something outside my control changed my stress level i took on a different role at work that is much less stressful i had no idea how big of an impact this was because i didnt consider myself stressed but several symptoms subsided with this change like everything digestive and the chest pain is less frequent after i was told the chest pains are costochondritis inflammation of the rib tissues read stressinduced i saw a chiropractor for about 5 months who taught me some stretches and selfadjustments i could do with a back roller and now ive trained myself not to panic when i feel those chest pains just do the stretches and trust that im fine and sure enough i am also my doctor told me to cut caffeine and i didnt listen i am a coffee junkie and cut back but didnt cut it out entirely well recently i switched to decaf i know stick with me and its been lifechanging yes this is obvious yes we all know caffeine raises your physiological arousal level but many of us keep consuming caffeine not realizing just how much it actually contributes to the cycle im a much happier person on decaf and i dont think ill go back i found out all of the shit i was dealing with can be caused by anxiety so this whole time it was the fear of a health problem that was causing health problems stress impacts us more than we realize so to recap here are the things my dumb ass put off doing forever that really made a huge impact get a doctors opinion as in a thorough one if possible instead of just a quick visit they will run some tests and give you a professional take on it when you get this trust it if you have reason to believe the doctor missed something get a second opinion but really you should trust the doctor manage your external stress this doesnt mean quit your job but if something is stressing you out a situation at work a significant other family take some real steps to get out of that situation in my case it was a lateral transfer and a change in responsibilities but man did it lower my stress levels cut the caffeine and any other stimulants including recreational ones if you struggle with anxiety your brain is already pumping you full of stress hormones in a fightorflight response you absolutely do not want to make it worse even a little can impact some people like me apparently for the love of reddit never google your symptoms the terrible thing about anxiety is once it has you its a downward spiral but the inverse is true too once you are confident in your situation and know the quirks of your own body you can come out of it quickly too hope this helps someone,pre-pandemic

third time this week ive bought a six pack of ipas i already know ill be done with it by tomorrow maybe its not as bad as some others but this is a habit ive desperately been trying to break for context im a 24 yo female and this started a couple months ago when i was living at my parents i got into the habit of buying ipas every now and then and the habit followed me until it was at least 2 6packs a week i even started hiding my purchases from my parents and bringing it secretly up to my room to prevent the shame ive since moved out and live alone and its only getting worse living alone makes it so much harder the urge to have a bunch of beers or a few glasses of wine is strong i bought a bottle of white the other day and finished it the same night wasnt even that drunk either i dont feel the same buzz from drinking anymore i just feel the need to drink any advice i was proud of myself for only having 1 ipa last night only for me to go out and buy a 6 pack today feeling super bloated all the time too obviously im an avid gym goer but my progress is 100 stunted by the wine and beer not to mention once it hits 3pm during the work week i work from home the urge to drink hits me nobody knows when you work remote which makes it so much easier to crack open a beer and finish the work day,post-pandemic

hey rhealthanxiety just thought id make a post detailing my personal experience and knowledge about reassurance seeking and why it is self destructive so youre experiencing your symptom that youre increasingly more worried about whether that be chest pains heart palpitations stomach problems poop problems any of the hundreds of symptoms any of us could possibly be worried about youre worried about if this is the time where your worrying is justified or if it is actually a sign of the illness youre fearing maybe youve already been to the doctor to get checked out but doubt their opinion all of these have happened to me and happen to many many other ha sufferers which is completely okay however the way you deal with it is paramount to your recovery usually what i would do is post here explaining my symptoms and what i was worried it was then id get some replies reassuring me and maybe feel better for a bit or id ask a close friend or family member and get the same results all of this felt like what i had to do a huge compulsion to do this just to know that i was fine in the short term yes it made me feel better but this was only short lived this might also account for medical tests ive spoken to many people who have previously thought that getting that mri or ct colonoscopy or endoscopy or whatever it might be would make all their worries go away which after the short term relief the anxiety came back this is so important to understand and grasp to begin recovering from health anxiety i speak from experience one of the biggest things in recovery is how you deal with these thoughts and need for reassurance possibly even the key to fixing your health anxiety so if you dont seek that reassurance whats going to happen for me at first it was unbareable anxiety and just an extreme desire to check i was okay whether that was through posting to the subreddit the discord asking family checking my body for lumps checking my lymph nodes etc youll most likely experience increased anxiety whilst not seeking the reassurance you want which is completely okay rather than seeking reassurance do something mindful something genuinely healthy for the mind as when in a very high anxiety situation sometimes its the things that you do during that time that really define how your mental wellbeing will go in the future you can do many things for me it was taking myself away from what i was doing and spending 10 minutes trying to immerse or distract myself within something else not an easy task by any means but something to try after the 10 minutes was up i would come back to what i was doing and try to revert my thoughts away from my worry which most times the anxiety had passed and i didnt need to seek further reassurance you could possibly try meditation though if you dont regularly practice it itll be very difficult to do under high anxiety levels you could try relaxing music your favourite food anything else that enhances your mood whatever works for you during this time you will experience anxiety potentially more during that time of not seeking the reassurance but i promise you in the long run it is going to do wonderful things compared to getting the reassurance and feeding the problem when you seek reassurance youre reinforcing the behaviours which keep your health anxiety alive unfortunately because usually it feels like the right thing and the only thing to do in that situation but trust me try not seeking it itll be very similar to this graph the more you do it the easier itll be and it might get to the point where the anxiety almost completely goes after a while of practicing this seriously it is worth definitely giving a go and thinking about this if youre currently having a lot of anxiety ive been there hundreds of times and applying this mentality was one of the key turning points into recovering from health anxiety,pre-pandemic

i need some advice i want to move from the rural assisted living into supportive apartment in the city i am currently living in an assisted living group home it is in a rural area with no public transportation staff manages my meds and are around 247 if i need support its like living in a cocoon it is both good and bad what i like about it is i am less worried about be followed or intruded upon i tend to get very worried about being followed by cars and people on foot the rural area has made me feel safe from this with that said i have become a shut in the only time i go out is to appointments i also feel like i am wasting my life living here i used to live abroad and i miss that i can only be gone for 30 days at a time living in the assisted living and maybe that should be good enough but if i lived in the assisted apartment i could live part time abroad and i could move anywhere in the us after a year of living in this city somewhere i feel safer but what if i have a breakdown what if people start following me what if i feel like a prisoner in my own apartment going back to the group home would not be an option as there is a long waiting list so what do you think yolo or play it safe,post-pandemic

i was a huge fan of the show house particularly in college and high school as someone who wasnt diagnosed until young adulthood 26 i sometimes look back on my past through the lens of adhd to try and make sense of past behaviors preferences etc i had this random thought as you do that one of the reasons i felt like i related to dr house very strongly in the past was his lackadaisical behavior when it came to routine but intense interest in bizarre and novel cases and personal drama friends coworkers his intense interest in general hospital thats when it hit me did house have adhd and by extension does sherlock holmes house is based on holmes have adhd i did a little google search and someone in this subreddit beat me to the punch sounds convincing to me makes me feel better about my adhd too ill swallow that koolaid with a smile on my face,pre-pandemic

would this approach work you make a list of medical tests for conditions you are afraid of and rank them by how much anxiety inducing they are from least to most scary then you do them one by one in order so list could look something like this 1 routine checkup 2 eye exam 3 cbc complete blood count 4 eeg 5 ecg 6 chest xray 7 abdomen ultrasound 8 tumor markers 9 brain mri 10 emg and ncs so after doing all of them you have evidence that youre not dying and you also exposed yourself to anxiety inducing situations which could lower your overall anxiety in the future what do you think could this work,post-pandemic
surely im not the only one that needs their ears brutally assaulted by the most aggressive asmr known to man in order to fall asleep i have fond memories of falling asleep with heavy metal or horror movies playing one time my cousin woke me up from my after school nap because he came home and found me blasting let the bodies hit the floor through a guitar amp on repeat right next to my head although i havent been officially diagnosed with adhd i have been diagnosed with mdd and gad since 2013 that being said behavior like this doesnt make sense to me you wouldnt think someone with extreme anxiety and depression could happily fall asleep to nasty heavy metal riffs or scenes from chucky but here i am does anyone here do the same,post-pandemic

hi i would like to propose this theory i am totally not kidding if you think about it a lot of people with autism have less social skillsless capacity to deal with emotions or pick up small non verbal cues hidden meanings etc increased cognitive capacities less emotiional attachment more rational reasoning very little aggressive most of the time dont understand why people would be mean to them etc dont we as homo genre slowly moved away from emotional and instinctual reasoning and started to use our rational minds to adapt to our surroundings why cant it be that autism is just a step foward in human evolution with our brain shutting down or modifiying the way we interact with our reptile ancient part of the brain and now moving away from our symian ancestry inbrain behaviour i am being deadly serious here i would like to hear your thoughts on the matter,pre-pandemic

i always feel like people dont like me or think i am weird i have generalised anxiety but for the past year and a half i have been struggling with social anxiety and this constant fear that i have done or said something wrong i always overthink situations that have happened where i have done or said something weird which makes me feel worse it also makes me overthink peoples behaviour towards me and makes me think that if a person is mad at me or hates me if their behaviour is different this sometimes happens when i visit my partners family and even if nothing bad happens i get anxious and replay everything that i said and done when i saw them this especially happens at work with a coworker who is being rude to me and i constantly try to be nice to them or do their work for them so they can treat me a bit better or at least be nice but they dont change and because of this my anxiety gets worse it hurts and makes me feel worse because this coworker is being nice to everyone else but wont even talk to me apart from when they want to be sarcastic towards me i know that i shouldnt take it personally but i do and my anxiety just makes it worse this all leads to not wanting to go out with friends or family because i am scared i might say or do something wrong or weird and people will hate me i would really appreciate some advice on how to handle this anxiety because i really want to work on this so i can feel better and enjoy seeing family and friends again,post-pandemic
i was never a good friend i was always a problem for you and i was always a fool and did not understand i think that being sorry for the millionth thing will be useless and you are no longer the same the story is over i cannot fix what was lost i can try to make the competition better if i succeed in that i wish you were the first friend i lost but you are the last and no one will come after you because you are the last in my life my life is no longer life and i only want to die now but i dont want to take this friendship with me to the grave i want it to stay with you so you will remember me if you naturally want that i closed everything in front of me and life did the same thing and i had no other way to be a normal person again i was never a good friend and i would never be a perfect friend as i dreamed i am just a fool everyone left him to die alone goodbye my last friend if you want to say goodbye and peace to all the people in this world that left me suffering alone,post-pandemic
for about a year my anxiety got a lot better until about three months ago when it suddenly got extremely bad i had a bad panic attack in public and almost passed out and everything spiralled from there since then i have probably left my house a maximum of ten times all of which for extremely short periods of time for a bit i was having panic attacks daily but since then it is mostly when i try to go outside i really do not know how to go about getting my life back on track i havent seen anyone apart from my partner in months i got kicked out of college as a result of not attending i lack the motivation to even try and get out now as it is just tiring and the thought of it makes me anxious in itself being inside all of the times makes me feel even worse if anyone else has been in a similar position any help would be appreciated thank you,post-pandemic
im sorry for that horribly constructed sentence im a weird split between extroverted and introverted but i love having a day or two to myself to just do whatever id like in the comfort of my cozy home however my anxiety makes it so hard to do that sometimes and the guilt of doing relaxing things when i should be doing other things and my lack of ability to concentrate my angry thoughts all tend to sweep up that day full of potential and curb stomp it on the ground i end up crying getting nothing done and also not being able to relax so then ive wasted a day and now i feel 100x worse about myself does this happen to anyone else edit thank you all for your replies it definitely makes me feel less alone in all this you guys are the best,pre-pandemic

i have been facing a few problems since the past 6 months with no solution it all started in august when i had twitching in my temples which used to take place every 15 days but used to last an entire day and once the twitching was gone i used to feel sharp pain in the same region which further extended till my neck i was visited a gp and was given a couple of meds after which the pain was gone but somewhere in september first week i started to feel these weird sensations in my legs such as twitches buzzing in foot and pulling sensation in my hamstring it got upto a point where i used to feel that i wont be able to move my leg i used to feel dizzy almost everyday this has since been on and off and here we are in mid february and nothing has changed i visited an orthopaedic for the symptoms i was facing in my leg as well as a neurologist who carried a general examination i also carried out a complete blood work of 66 parameters which came out to be perfect as well i also visited an ophthalmologist to check whether the dizziness was due to my eyes getting strained which was also stated completely fine by him i also occasionally face sharp pain in my ankles wrist ears without any activity which usually lasts for a couple of mins i feel i wont be able to carry something in my hands i am the same person who used to deadlift 150kgs at some point last year i was then told that this is psychological since every possibility has been ruled out i have been taking therapy since november but these weird sensations in my legs and wrist still persist i have been sick of all this as i was always sportive and never used to sit in my room i even started jogging a few weeks back but the intensity of symptoms increased hence i stopped again i am really sorry for such a long paragraph but i am just desperate to find solutions to this someone please help,post-pandemic
hello everyone i should mention that if the concept of a brain aneurysm bothers you this post may make you anxious however the intention is to provide relief to people in my situation by sharing some statistics ive dug up regarding brain aneurysms here are the statistics x200b in the united states the general public has a 5 chance of developing an aneurysm in their lifetime this affects women more than men at a ratio of 32 of these 8590 never show symptoms of these only around 1 occur in children under 18 presumably the number is not greatly higher in young adults 20s though i was not able to find direct statistics on that of all aneurysms only around 1 of aneurysms will ever rupture around 99 of people with unruptured brain aneurysms never have to worry about it and die from something else of these many cases correlate to other risk factors genetics lifestyle habits of this survival rate is as high as 60 x200b based off this its reasonable to conclude that the odds for an otherwise healthy person in their 20s with no risk factors to have an aneurysm are very very unlikely rarer than being struck by lightning literally furthermore while it may seem scary that they cause no symptoms it also may help a hypochondriac to realize that their symptoms are psychosomatic imagined caused by anxiety though of course if symptoms do arise and persist its important to discuss them with a doctor also keep in mind that the symptoms of a ruptured aneurysm are unmistakable some of these statistics may seem obvious but it has helped me to lay them out and i hope it also helps you,pre-pandemic

i dont expect you to read this just need somewhere to vent here i am again sitting alone in front of my tiny space heater trying to find a reason to keep going it doesnt help that its christmas eve im basically a 24 year old virgin and have spent holidays alone for the past 5 years i remember bill burr said at like 39yrs old he stopped going home for the holidays i envy that at 18 i went to college across the country to get away from my abusive mother even picked a college she hated it would embarrass her speaking of college im still unsure whether i was molested its hard to say when you wake up to some guy in your bed the not knowing really pisses me the fuck off to this day my mom doesnt think shes done any wrong after i dropped out i went back home for a little bit i dont know what i expected a year or two later i move across the country again to get away now i am truly and utterly alone im currently on my 22nd or 23rd deadend job honestly cant believe ive lasted so long at this one i guess i look up to the store manager a lot and dont want to let him down ive seen a hundred therapists been on a million different meds went to rehab for 6 months and i feel worse now than i ever have depression anxiety paranoia theyre all too minor to describe what i feel had my first suicidal thought at 9yrs old at that same age i realized i wanted a girlfriend it was like there was a hole in my heart i think i just wanted a female in my life because i hated my mother but i knew i was too young and figured id get one later in life nope never been in a real relationship i was with a girl in high school for a couple months maybe we sorta had sex once but i wouldnt even call it that every girl ive tried to pursue since either wasnt interested or i didnt try hard enough didnt have enough experience to understand what they wanted me to do doesnt help that i grew up afraid of my mother and hating her in college i was so desperate to get laid i went on craigslist casual encounters when that was a thing but girls from my floor found those pictures and passed them around that shattered the little confidence i had that is just one experience but probably the one that most changed my perspective of women i wish i could tell those girls how much damage theyve done then all my fuckups with girls just added to my pain dating apps dont work its like my account is invisible at this point i dont try whatsoever its as if ive been conditioned to not make a move and the ironic part is i look like a model genes muscles sixpack dress well and im actually very smart the few parties ive ever gone to girls basically threw themselves at me and i would freak out have a panic attack and then leave alcohol didnt help im not gay im just broken a beautiful girl might look at me and give all the signs that she wants me to talk to her she might even come talk to me first ill just shut down afterward ill get angry at myself so ive stopped going places where i might meet a girl because i know whats going to happen ive always found it interesting how much i relate to ugly guys who wont pursue a woman because they know what will happen and those guys take one look at me and hate me its like theyre thinking man if i could just trade places with that guy hahaha aint shit would change man youd be just as alone and maybe feel worse than you already do at this point the only reason i havent shot myself in the face is because of my dog my cat wouldnt give a shit but i cant do that to my dog i just cant the sad part though is dogs vibe off you and adopt your personality meaning hes gone from an angel to anxious and quick to fight other dogs so maybe itd be for the best if he had a different owner cant exactly take him to the dog park anymore and im sure you can tell how close i am to suicide because i know exactly where to shoot for your sake ill spare the details i dont know why im writing this i guess the holidays are pushing me over the edge i just cant be alone anymore the girl i like is a coworker who shut me down for a different coworker who went and cheated on her and now i feel like maybe shes expecting me to make another move i dont know but the way i am im not gonna pursue a girl who shut me down you know how hard it was to tell her how i feel couldnt even do it in person had to send some stupid message now i have to see her every day i guess thats why you dont ask out people from work i have panic attacks every night and the thin walls in this ghetto apartment complex do not help nor do the gunshots down the street i have no one to call my dad kind of understands what im going through but theres only so much he can handle every time i talk to him i feel like hes about to have a heart attack my brother says i have an illness that just needs to be treated i feel like he thinks i just want attention obviously i dont talk to my mom i actually blocked her and the suicide hotline dont get me started its like they want you to die the two real friends i had forgot about me once they found girlfriends i dont know how much time i have left and i always thought i was destined for big things youre all i have left reddit you and my dog shit the cat probably wants me gone if you read this far thank you from the bottom of my heart edit thank you everyone this was more helpful than rehab and yes i love my cat hes actually really interesting basically a reallife garfield edit 2 i think dave chappelle said it best when he talked about anthony bourdain thats why i used that title i cant stand when people think i have it all so how can i be so unhappy anyway thank you again everyone and thank you for the platinum whatever it means that made my day edit 3 i am either delusional or my coworkers read this post not sure which is worse but it really feels like one of them read it and passed that shit along like a hot potato i hear them talking and i hope its just confirmation bias but it sounds like theyre talking and laughing about what i wrote why are you laughing you fucks more gossip to gobble up one of the guys here tried to have a real talk with me how bad are these intrusive thoughts getting i havent been acting different at work why would he ask me that i did have people contact me saying they werent on this sub but found it just scrolling through rall so i dont know how many people actually read this i guess its possible someone i know came across it funny that i care when im so close to ending it all glad i got it off my chest though was a huge weight lifted and the support from you guys was unreal i didnt respond to

i just needed to get this off my mind and im surprised i havent made a post about it yet i had been sober since oct 5th 2023 i had decided to drink recently and have a bender dumb i know because i already know to play the tape i am a chronic relapser and completely understand that the crappy symptoms go away over time but the crippling anxiety over what this last bender did and i wont get into detail about it really other than i just cant stand it because it comes and goes and if my mind drifts and thinks about one of the many things i need to take care of it will literally wake me up from falling asleep and start having waves of panic i hate it im starting to be the one to give up on myself now ive been trying to get sober since 2019 i will get days weeks even months in mostly what helped me was smoking weed but i am trying to not do that anymore because i want a job that isnt freakin waitressing huge trigger to drink for a lot of reasons and honestly i had this job where they drug test and i felt uncomfortable at the idea of being high while working there so im fine with it but since august ive been weed free for the most part started taking gummies but im not high 247 like i used to be and i prefer it actually not to be high like that all the time and then up until recently id been sober from alcohol since october both of last year so it was my longest stretch of being actually stone cold sober since trying to quit in 2019 and i enjoy many many things about sobriety i also had an 8 month stretch in 2021 but i was smoking at the time weed has never been an issue that distrupted my life so i do consider it at least sober from alcohol i just hate it that i always get this itch to drink i get bored mostly but lately ive been so tired i just wake up drink for a while sleep repeat and sometimes i just feel like all i want to do is sleep anyways im trying to keep this as non depressing as possible i used to rant on and on and on about things i hate about my life and its like all it did was make it worse i try to stay positive im not sure what advice im looking for really i mostly wanted to just rant and it helps me to write and get my thoughts out and is helping me so far but if anyone had anything to tell me any of it is appreciated because even if its something im already well aware of or doesnt really apply to my situation it is good to just have people who know what its like to talk to so thats really what im looking for here thank you for reading x200b x200b,post-pandemic
ive never known a life without trauma the first one happened when i was a month old i dont remember it but the effects still linger to this day obviously that means that ive lived my 9999 of my life with trauma i had other traumas happen throughout toddler hood childhood and into my teens im sad that ive never known what it is like to be completely carefree and without damage despite being on better terms with my past a small part of me wants to live in a life where my traumas never happened,pre-pandemic
as someone who has been diagnosed with ptsd and also happens to have other types of trauma that didnt cause me to develop anything serious this is how i differentiate between the two and i say this because i noticed lots of people throw the word ptsd around but feel free to correct me if im wrong nightmares ptsd vomit inducing dreams i refuse to even tell myself or others what happened in the dream i do my best to distract myself to avoid experiencing a panick attack as a result of the nightmare normal trauma scary nightmare sure i alao wake up shaking but i can easily think back to what happened in the dream and be okay with it like its really sad that i keep reliving such terrible memories but i dont regret being alive while doing so its so different from a ptsd nightmare that when i have one i feel soo envious that this is what people mean when they say nightmare like thats a dream for me at this point lol flashbacks ptsd terrible just bad vivid memories the outline of the image in my head stays in my vision im terrified during normal trauma i dont experience them i remember the trauma often but its not vivid and terrifying it makes me cry but thats it triggers ptsd immediately weak in the knees stuttering blurry vision hot feeling spreading over my chest panick attacks body shaking hard for at least an hour aftwards shaking and weakness all over the body can last days if not handled immediately normal trauma occasional weakness in the knees stuttering and blurry vision never accompanied with vivid memories flashing in my eyes takes me a few minutes to recover rarely happens simply thinking back to it ptsd i dont thats asking for a panick attack fuck that normal trauma sad sad thing can make me cry what do you think,post-pandemic
my health anxiety is kinda like my ocd i need reassurance after a while last year i went to see my doctor who asked me for an endoscopy and he noticed a polyp that wasnt removed but he said it was okay because it could wait until my next endoscopy to be removed i was okay after that but sometimes ill get this anxious feeling that i should get the endoscopy sooner even though a literal doctor just told me it was okay how do i stop these thoughts and the anxiety of waiting a year these happen with other doctors as well after a while i just start doubting them all and i really wish i didnt i need to concentrate on my college exams right now and i cant,post-pandemic
long story short i wanted a tasty frozen treat i was gonna get a very low calorie pint of essentially flavorless frozen vegan substance so i went to the frozens section in walmart and lo and fucking behold its fucking locked because of these bastards doing that ice cream licking challenge i had to ask a fucking employee to open the thing up for me so i already feel hella vulnerable cause im interacting with another human being in the context of food and what does this fucker do i get my low calorie depression pint and this fucker rolls his eyes and says of course before locking the thing back i had to forgo all of the rest of my grocery list and check out immediately so i could get to my car before i started crying so basically if any of you fuckers do that lick the ice cream and put it back in the freezer challenge im going to come to your house and kick your ass,pre-pandemic
learning about asd and considering the possibility that i might have it is making me reframe some behaviours of mine when i was younger one thing that im tripping about rn is that i dont have outward meltdowns however im wondering if a thing i did when i was a kid that was eventually beatenbullied out of me could have been meltdowns so when i was a kid im talking about 38 years in age it was quite easy to get me to cry i dont fully remember all of it but i dont think that those were tantrums typical scenarios would have been a a thing happened or was said to me that made me panic because i imagined that it would have terrible permanent impact on me and would basically ruin my life b i felt that some grave injustice was done to me but i was too overwhelmed by the emotion andor didnt have the vocabulary to articulate myself otherwise and being subsequently punished for crying would only add to that feeling iirc the event that happened right before would be the sole trigger for the crying instead of a buildup of small triggers does this sound like meltdowns i assume that not everything that isnt a tantrum is automatically a meltdown but i also dont have a full understanding of the ways a meltdown can be triggered or manifest,post-pandemic
look i get a lot of you are bipolar ii and have never experienced true mania or psychosis but closing your eyes and sticking your fingers in your ear anytime there is evidence that someone with bipolar said and did really shitty things doesnt negate the fact that these are often symptoms of the disorder can we at least distinguish them as symptoms as opposed to personality traits just because your symptoms are less doesnt mean you are a better person telling someone that it is their fault their an ass when psychotic is like telling someone it is their fault they have no energy when depressed and telling someone they need to learn to manage their symptoms betterfor fucks sake everyone knows that is near impossible to manage all episodes what if someone told you that when you were depressed im going to use kanye west as an example people in the bp community went into an uproar because they didnt want to be associated with someone who is displaying absolute signs of severe mania bordering on psychosis what are you trying to say that he was in complete control of himself and is responsible for all of his actions there is a disconnect between people who have less severe forms of bp being disgusted by what the severe manifestation of this disease looks like and there is a lot of ignorance how many posts are there about weeee im hypomanic i love this and then berating someone in the media for being manic and claiming that they have a gift just because mania manifests itself productively in some of your lives doesnt mean that is the case for everyone imagine your hypomania keeps going up and up and up youre having so much fun and then bang psychosis hits mania and psychosis can make you into a shitty person that doesnt mean its the persons fault my mother has psychotic episodes about once a year despite weekly doctors appointment and staying consistent with her meds in her psychotic episodes she calls the cps on my siblings claims my dad has raped everyone steals and pawns all of our stuff and manipulated everyone causing excessive trauma do i blame her not anymore than id blame a cancer patient for extreme fatigue this is a characterizing symtpom of our disease im sorry that you dont want to be associated with crazy but guess what you have the benefit of being bp ii and will never have to experience the ruin that comes from psychosis so instead of stigmatizing a traumatic stmptom maybe count your blessings that you have the lack of experience that lead you to be so ignorant about the disorder i have been downvoted by saying that having bp will likely lead your children to trauma guess what guys if you have psychosis you will inevitably leave trauma on your family maybe you take offense because your bipolar isnt that bad but anyone who has experienced psychosis will readily admit to this just as anyone who has cancer will probably come to terms with the trauma their illness is causing on others because anything that is that severe is going to have serious impacts you are not better than other bipolar people because your symptoms are less it doesnt mean that you have a better handle on things that youre more responsible that you are a nicer person someone who is psychotic is not less than you they arent a shitty person its not because they arent trying i think these diseases should honestly be called something altogether adding psychosis into the mix is closer to schizophrenia than it is bpii but a lot of people dont seem to recognize this for the record i am bp ii so i get that depression is hard but unless youve witnessed or experienced psychosis or severe mania you have no right in judging others edit okay apparently i triggered a lot of bpii people look if you have never judged someone for psychosis then just ignore this post completely this was all it was made for no i am not saying that bipolar ii people have it easy or that they are less than a bp i diagnosis im bp ii ive been hospitalized ive lost jobs ive lost relationships this isnt about one diagnosis being better than another its about people who have no experience with psychosis thinking that psychosis is just an extension of their hypomania and yes id argue bp i is a more severe condition im not saying that your bpii is easy i get it i have been on the verge of suicide multiple times however my mother gets crippling depression but guess what else she gets psychosis she is completely dependent on me and my family what people dont understand is that bpi is by its nature more severe than bp iiin fact bp ii can turn into bp i if the symptoms get more severe but in reality i never should have mentioned these diagnostic terms since thats all they are to begin with this post was simply about psychosis and about those who have never experienced psychosis outwardly judging those who have,pre-pandemic
and as i have said in the past i share for pride but also to show others that you can stop killing yourself and the lives of those around you but getting clean and sober also as i have said in the past i have gone through cancer treatments spine surgery getting downsized losing people i loved very much granny last year as well as saying goodbye to our two cats that were basically our children crushed and still crushes me and many other things and i still didnt pick up so it is possible you just have to want it bad enough and reach out for help when you need it i dont ever want to be that lost psychotic unstable addict i once was cross posted to rstopdrinking rdinosaursinrecovery,pre-pandemic
as someone who spends too much time on reddit rautism is one of the kindest and sanest places on here as an allistic person it is a good and maybe important reminder about who autistic people are vs some characteristics that might stand out seems like most posts here are just people reaching out for help advice venting and if there are comments for the most part they are helpful or sympathizing typically on other subreddits someone will be trying to find fault with some minor aspect with a post or making it out like there is something wrong with the poster for what they had to say i know some people i have talked to here have had the same triggering experience on other subs too also no one has called me out for not belonging here which i think is generous wishing everyone here the best,post-pandemic
ive live here for over 6 years now and ever since i switched schools things have gone downhill i used to go to public school and now recently switched to a private school i have since realised that the friends from my old school are not good human beingsstealing blackmail telling stuff that is not true or is embarrassing of me as a new kid in the new school i have been left out of the inner circle only left with an occasional small talk ive realised that my old friends have already told bad things of me in this new school and now i feel left out and lonely despite this i strive to be nice to everybody and some people do recognise that however people are too afraid to put their good reputation on the line to hang out or talk to me i have been in this new school for 2 years and things just havent improved if somebody reached out with the same experiences i am going through or even just to talk for fun would be really cool,post-pandemic
hi everyone how has your experience with networking as someone with social anxiety been andor what advice would you give to a socially anxious person going into a career where networking is important heres some personal context if youre interested im a sophomore in college and am still figuring out exactly what i want to do right now the two careers i feel the most strongly about pursuing are graphic design and audio engineering from what i understand in order to be successful in these careers its very important to have the ability to make connections and network with others as someone who has struggled with social anxiety my entire life and has an especially hard time making friends and bonding with people careers with a networking aspect are very intimidating i never want to limit myself or write something off just because of the way my brain works but im paranoid that ill miss out on opportunities or worse have a a failed career its possible that im making a bigger deal out of this than i need too and this is just a very new concept to me,post-pandemic

hi all disclaimer i am not looking for diagnose since i am not sure if my friend has ppd or other kind of disorder im trying to see if there are anyone who experienced similar situation or symptoms as my friend so i can recommend the right help to her and her family my friend is 32f she was in a cult for a good 56years she had donated lots of her money give up her studies and unfriended lots of people she isolated herself thinking everyone who is not in her group is out to get her on top of that she wasnt allowed to sleep much since she had duties everyone has to follow a hierarchy and its very toxic to say the least i tried really hard to get her away from the organization for 3 years she just finally got out now she thinks some guy from the cult is trying to manipulate her mind mind control her bf who has been financially supporting her this entire time is cheating her reasons are also questionable she thinks the guy whos trying to manipulate her is using a book called art of pickup and her bf is cheating because when they are sleeping together he stop hugging her during summer in a tropical place with no ac i try to take her pov and follow her logic when i question her she would tell me to stop gaslighting her some of her point of view is quite convincing she also lots nearly 30 pounds of weight in less than 2 month she is not a big girl to start with and now shes got stomach pain all the time she recently reenrolled in school and is convinced that the orientation guide is an agent of the chinese communist party spy she then out of the blue ghosted me i was worried about her since she had suicidal ideation before so i went to her classshe send me her schedule and asked me to drop by before she ghosted me she saw me and ran away from what im describing does this sound like someone who is suffering from ppd if so what should i do approach this i no longer message her since im also afraid of herdont want to disturb her thank you,post-pandemic
just a rant its long malware is software written specifically to harm and infect the host system ptsd is the malware infecting my system and fear is the virus that wrecks havoc so i have been triggered and my symptoms take over my entire being i have 3 options flee freeze or fight these are the only options fear will give me suddenly a harmless and simple situation has turned into a battle for my survival and yes to me its as dire as it sounds so my logic and reason programming has been overridden its not gone its still running but its only running at minimum so the virus can feed off the program and piggy back on the signal to proceed with the virus own programming so i am faced with the three options mentioned above what do they look like flee literally leave the situation in any way i can seeing as the logic and reason programming is still running albeit at a limitation i can process enough information from my environment to look for an immediate exit and follow through with fleeing from the situation analyzing my environment for an exit is about the only way i can use the logic and reason program that is still running and this is an immediate reaction either i phsically leave my environment asap or make arrangements and overcoming necessary hurdles to leave the way i flee is dependant on the trigger that accessed the survival instinct and the severity of my reaction to flee is also dependant on said specific trigger no matter what im doing or whats going on when im triggered its time to flee fight so my fear of my survival has been activated essentially my logic and reason program has been infected with the malicious code fear and my logic and reason programming is running at a minimum ive already scanned and processed the option to leave but i have come to the conclusion that fleeing is not an option meaning my exits in my environment are blocked or there are people who are blocking my exits for my reaction to be extreme enough to want to fight the people blocking my only exits must be some type of authority for example police officers emts or any type of medical professionals my understanding is that these people are the only people who can act on their authority at will with or without good intent in civil society these people are considered as necessary and these people are supposed to hold good intent i am recounting vividly how each and everyone of these so called authority with good intent violated me physically and psychologically seeing as i dont want to relive said horrible experiences again i consider theses authorities as enemies to my survival whenever i see them when my survival instinct has been severely triggered i will fight these authorities i will flail and scream and cry and do whatever makes them feel uncomfortable by being naked or screeching and howling when they touch me and it seems like in my experience these authorities do not have the faculties or understanding to not not treat me like an animal i mean in all of my recounted experiences of cops emts and nurses they exacerbated my symptoms by physically hurting me and demeaning me remember my logic and reason program is still running in the background so im still aware of whats being said to me how they are touching me how they handle me and what emotions they evoke when they demean me plus im cogiscent enough to realize causing injury to said authorities is a metaphorical death sentence i dont want to go to jail or be arrested or treated like a dangerous and malicious mentally ill person so i am cognizant enough not to cause injury to others im just scared and i cry do these professionals really think im a danger to them when im naked and bawling and screeching about being raped and that i dont want to be touched without care dont i have a right to say dont touch me during perineal care yet said medical professionals disregard my repeated requests rendering me even more panicked about being in the er they think im insane well they are the ones who are insane with reasoning that extreme measures of restraint ridicule and deliberate touching of my clitoris is the only way to treat a frightened crying naked young woman who let these people be medical professionals and they get to live their lives thinking they did nothing wrong while i suffer im reliving these memories to the point of not functioning due to the extreme anxiety that these memories induce i have ptsd from my experience at the er ptsd that is being treated with the help of my primary doctor who btw i can barely see because he triggers such horrible feelings and memories medical professionals are suppose to be a beacon of hope but instead they are psychological abusers when it comes to psychological trauma its like all their training goes out the window and im just some animal these medical professionals should not be allowed to wantonly explain away their cruelty and the robbing of my humanity with a phrase of that just my job yet i have no name of the woman who touched my clitoris deliberately while providing perineal care i dont even recall if she was an rn or cna but the restraints those were uncalled for and im going to have to live with that trauma for the rest of my life freeze knowing i cant fight or flee my body and brain just shuts down im immobile incapable of normal interaction im still cognizant of whats around me but im being forced to watch the memories like some sick psycho is tying my down to a chair and forcing horrible movies about my life im shivering holding back tears gripping whatever is in my hand with dear life just visible distressed and immobile every single one of these reactions are embarrassing and shameful in polite society im no longer worthy to exist because people just dont understand what trauma does to a person edit i didnt expect my post would get as much traction as it did thank you for your stories i feel kinda weird for being grateful to share this specific type of trauma with others yet before the ptsd subreddit i felt so alone and so ashamed i wish you all safe travels on the path to healing ps any medical professionals who just have the need to educate me or anyone else on proper ems procedure with the intention to exonerate ems personelwell i cant stop youbut just know your unsolicited advice will fall on deaf ears pss im coming off as angry and maybe a little harsh in my writing tone becauseim angry im not neccesarily proud of sounding so angry but i think i have the right to do so in order to express the trauma i received i believe its part of my personal healing process,pre-pandemic
using throwaway account for this cant risk being identified i 48m have had an issue with pain pills for many years now i remember first being given them for a good reason in about 2006 while i used them as prescribed and appropriately for some time it wasnt too long after that until instead of taking them two at a time i took more than i should to try and recreate that high at my very worst i was taking 20 at a time often more than once a day i realised i had to get a better handle on this and was able to reduce consumption to 1015 a day still far too many theres paracetamol acetaminophen for the yanks alongside the opiate in this particular pill how my liver has survived the abuse from that ive no idea i didnt just take those though i also quite liked tramadol a synthetic opiate no paracetamol these id take in huge handfuls to the point i actually had a seizure its a common side effect to overdose of this particular pill getting supplies wasnt difficult for me im a gp and so with some modified lets not kid myself fraudulently falsified patient records id simply issue a prescription in their name and be careful where i went to get it filled i used pharmacies outside my own town which is small and people know my face im not really sure what made me realise that i need to get a grip on this but ive decided that it really has to stop the stuff im doing would be career ending i really dont want that i love my job not just as a source of drugs its all i ever wanted to do and i think that im actually pretty good at it i cant quite get my head round just how much the stuff ive been doing put all that at risk im not sure i think i rationalise stuff in my head and manage to convince myself that its not actually too bad for now it looks like ive got away with the prescription fraud up to this point not proud of that but grateful i cant go on defrauding my patients i cant go on needing a buzz to get myself through the day and i cant go on taking such regular and substantial overdoses of hepatotoxic drugs i dont want to lose my job and i dont want to die im on day 5 without a single pain pill i can only guess that im lucky because i dont seem to be suffering any particular physical withdrawal symptoms except a certain amount of diarrhoea its the psychological thing im struggling with swallowing a handful of pills each day has become such a part of my life that it still feels like somethings missing i cant begin to imagine how long thats likely to continue ive concluded that coldturkey and just trying to move on is the only way i can do this without further threatening my career i treat and advise patients about this frequently this is very rarely the method id recommend the benefits of the support of an addictions specialist are enormous but i cant see a way to make that an option for myself i really want and need this to be the end of this i just dont know if i can and to be perfectly honest im terrified just dont know what to do,post-pandemic
im extremely autistic and i have sensory needs so i was scrunching up some paper very quietly when my brother just grabs me twists my arm 360 degrees causing me to start crying he starts screaming at me saying im annoying saying he wished i never existed this was about 5 mins ago i am currently hiding in my closet typing this message sometimes i just wish i wasnt autistic and ill i think when this happens is why why me,post-pandemic
i dont have friends and i never had a girlfriend i know that i can improve my chances of someone showing interest in me but i guess im too prideful to really fix anything about myself im out of shape i wear very plain clothes i cut my own hair simple buzz cut and i look restless most of the time if i put on a nice outfit or go to a barbershop instead of me cutting my own hair i feel like i look desperate for approval i dont know if its because of bullying and ostracism i faced as a teenager or if its just my own cynicism that makes me feel that way theres nothing wrong with putting in effort in the way that you present yourself to the world its encouraged even by many but i just cant do it myself if people see that ive put in effort to make myself look as good as i possibly can then i imagine people will just laugh at me because all of my efforts are in vain its perfect normal to want to rid ones self of their loneliness i think people would even try to support one another by helping each other improve maybe suggest new outfits hairstyles or colognesperfumes i just cant imagine that being the case for me i dont believe people would be supportive of me in my effort to improve and would prefer that i be put back down in my place im expect to just wallow in my pity and it looks like thats just what ill do ive ruined my opportunity of having my first girlfriend as a teenager a young adult and now my mid twenties im growing older and less youthful by the year the expectations of a man in his thirties and forties are much greater than that of a 25 year old im so far back behind in life for my age it seems like im always going to be playing catch up with the rest of the competition i want to care about my appearance but it just feels so wrong for me its like imagining a quasimodolike figure wearing a really nice suit or lipstick on a pig at the end of the day they are still fundamentally flawed and no amount of effort will ever really be enough for most people some people will even laugh at them and call them delusional for thinking that theyll ever have a chance at finding someone thats how i feel about myself until hopefully one day ill finally get over this fear im going to just continue to appear stoic and pretend as if everything is ok as far as the world is concerned im perfectly happy being alone,post-pandemic

im 27f active duty military new to using reddit but i have had such a hard time trying to find anyone who can relate to the type of trauma that i experienced even though i know there are definitely other people in the world who have experienced similar things id like to talk about it here to get some more feedback and just be able to vent a little please do not bring up any of your political opinions about military ukrainerussia etc since that is not the point of my bringing any of this up tldr 69 months of my 2022 deployment were spent in near total isolation with nothing except repetitive exposure to the horrors what were taking place in ukraine during the first 8 months of the war i developed memory issues and also for a short while a stutter i developed anxiety and irrational fear of being out in public i left to a different country for 3 months with some other soldiers and better housing and i made new friends there before coming back to the states i thought i was on a road to recovery from what i had experienced thanks to being able to talk to these new friends however very shortly after coming back one of my best friends committed suicide and that felt like a confirmation of everything that i had feared would happen after such a long deployment and being separated from everyone back at home now nearly a year later i still am in a deep depression and feel very distant from my friends and family i started trying to go to therapy but my therapist right away is trying to emphasize me having to heal on my own and not rely on other people whenever i try to talk about my experience she only tries to tell me that i just need to validation of knowing that what i went through was rough but she doesnt even want to call what i am suffering right now ptsd im getting very tired of coming to her and i dont know how to steer the conversation right at the beginning of the russiaukraine war i was deployed overseas with a very small group of soldiers these were not soldiers that i knew however i was transferred to a new unit just for the point of going on the deployment i have always been the kind of person who can quickly make new friends but unfortunately the people that i deployed with were not interested in getting to know me at all and were not very responsive to my attempts to build friendship and rapport the location that we lived in was essentially a abandoned warehouse and we made little sections for ourselves out of bed sheets for privacy my unit was essentially forgotten about once we were deployed so we did not have to show up for work for nearly 6 months it started out as kind of a vacation but quickly became what i would like to refer to as free range solitary confinement i ran out of things to do anf places to travel the handful of soldiers i were deployed with were content to sit in their boxes all day and play computer games so i never saw any of them we did not work with any of the other soldiers at the base so i did not have an opportunity to get to meet any of them given how wildly different our schedules were i soon found that i had absolutely no one to talk to except for the occasional phone call from home additionally my job required me to keep a close eye on what was happening with the war in ukraine i can speak and understand russian and some of the duties that i performed required me to translate things and pay very close attention to news and different kinds of reports im not going to get into much detail about that but suffice it to say that day in and day out i was listening to stories of innocent people being killed both ukrainian and russian soldiers dying pointlessly and painfully family members on all sides wailing for their loved ones and people not even being able to afford the decency of burying their dead understanding all of these things in the languages that they were spoken made it hit that much closer to home i dont speak ukrainian but i can understand it i also had personal friends who had family members in both ukraine and russia so everything that i saw was not only horrific but had a deeply personal touch to it i had no one to talk to about any of this either because the soldiers that i was with were not interested or because my friends and family are back at home could not understand why i was so deeply invested in what was going on i find that people naturally do not want to expose themselves to the horrors of war and they try to remain distant and unaffected i am also the only person in my family and friend group who can speak russian and who has an understanding of the cultures of both ukraine and russia watching this war unfold has been absolutely heartbreaking to me and there are images and stories in my head that i cannot get rid of the entire time that i was there i felt haunted by what was going on and by all the suffering i had seen and to this day i still feel haunted i dont feel like i have anyone i can talk to about any of this who will not just try to tell me not to care so much even if i didnt care who would not be horrified by death and destruction and mutilation i finally got myself to start going to therapy after i had found that after several months i was not getting better i had also recently lost one of my closest friends i fellow soldier who i would talk to by phone every day while in the states and not only was i grieving her loss but i also felt a sense of guilt since i had not really been there for her while i was overseas everything about her death is a mystery to me and i cant seem to get any information so it is very hard to have any closure beyond trying to tell myself that she knew that i loved her while at therapy i shared all of this with my therapist and she said that it was very unusual to find someone who had been through this entire list of circumstances and then went on to talk about how my case was so unique that i should give up on finding anyone to talk to about it and relate to i looked at her and told her that she basically is verbalizing my worst fear with those words i cant really remember anything she said after that but i felt so terrible the entire the day that i had to ask my leadership if i could just go home so that i wouldnt have to embarrass myself by crying in public that first therapy session left me with all kinds of negative feelings for weeks after until our next session i decided the next section not to talk about my experience overseas at all but instead focus on my friends suicide that discussion seemed pretty much what i would expect but i felt that my therapist seemed pretty eager to move on and almost relieved that i didnt bring up anything else do this date ive had several sessions with this therapist and i have brought up my experience again and shes begun to refer to what i am experiencing as pts emphasizing that its not ptsd this is despite the fact that i told her that i could not fall asleep without having panic attacks that have severe insomnia and that im constantly depressed and feel irreparably distant from my friends and family i keep asking her for direction and something that i can do to help improve my situation and she hasnt given me any advice at this point i just feel so discouraged and i dont know what to do other than asking for another therapist if you read this far thank you so much your

help i badly struggle with writing essays i can think of tons of poetic things to say but whenever im faced with a big nebulous illdefined project that i cant produce a procedure for myself i get overwhelmed i usually have to stare at a prompt until the ideas and the flow come to me and let my brain settle down enough about it to think but in college this is obviously a terrible strategy im getting into higherlevel composition courses so the prompts are becoming looser and its up to the students to figure out what to talk about and has gotten me in quite a few pickles i cant figure out what to say i want to say too many things and then sometimes i narrow it down too much and have to spin it to fit a word count how do you get your brain to plan an essay when you have so many thoughts all the time i procrastinate on essays so much like the one im currently trying to write that the added sense of panic bars me from calming down enough to sit down and plan until the absolute last second,post-pandemic
ive been best friends with this girl for around 7 years and in 2019 she was struggling with bulimia pretty badly and for a long time i was the only one who knew of her disorder back then i was also clueless about how to help her because she refused to accept she had a problem and it became a really sensitive topic between us but by the end of 2019 she had told her mother everything and began recovery although we never really spoke about it either which was going well for her of course i dont know what she did behind closed doors but as i have struggled and am still struggling with an eating disorder myself i didnt see any signs that she was still actively engaging in her ed like i used to before and she seemed also physically healthier that was until around septemberoctober of 2023 when she started talking about her weightbody again and how she wanted to lose weight we were out eating once and after eating she went to the bathroom took a long time and came back with bloodshot eyes and shaky hands i knew exactly that she had purged but i didnt want to believe it so i brushed it off and i also didnt know if i should talk to her about it especially since we were in public over the course of the last months she visibly lost weight and in december she even specifically told me and asked me to guess how much she lost but i refused since i didnt want to fuel her ed i also never comment on her body or weight loss in any way because i know from my ed how triggering even small remarks can be and she told me she lost 18kg in the last 3 months later that day we were at a party and when she was already pretty drunk she kept talking about her body and told me what her ultimate goal weight those exact words too which is a common phrase in ed spaces is this was what confirmed for me that she had relapsed she also keeps reposting tiktoks that are about weight and starving yourself on her alt account which i think she forgot that i follow i want to help her but i dont know how she is very sensitive when i bring up her history with bulimia and in the past always shut down any concern i considered confiding in a common friend we have but i think that would be a really shitty thing to do to her and if she was to talk to someone about my ed with someone id feel very hurt too so i most likely wont do that but i cant keep this to my self much longer mostly because i know that shes suffering and im literally doing nothing to help her what should i do i know i should talk to her and that i know her best but i really have no clue how to even bring it up,post-pandemic

ive had health anxiety for maybe five years now specifically heartrelated i havent had a panic attack in about a year but im 36 weeks pregnant pregnancy and birth has always been a big fear of mine and all the crazy new sensations have definitely been testing me so far my biggest fear is getting preeclampsia the major symptom being high blood pressure i have major white coat and have had many a panic attacks from high blood pressure readings that included trips to the er and calling an ambulance some of my lowest moments i always knew if i got that high reading that it could trigger a panic attack and also just thinking i could go into laborbe inducedemergency csection could trigger it as well well tonight i got a high blood pressure reading while testing at home i did as my doctor directed and laid in bed in the dark deep breathing for about 30 mins and tested again it did not go down so far i was only slightly anxious but like normal human without anxiety anxious i called the oncall doctor at my hospital and she told me to come in normally that call would be the biggest trigger for me someone confirming my fear ive had calls like that before and bam full on panic attack but it didnt come i did start my deep breathing and had to distract myself from thinking tonight could be the night as my hubby and i packed our hospital bags in the car and headed out when we got to the hospital i asked to sit there for a bit in the car i turned on one of my meditation songs deep breathed and told myself that things might get scary but it will all be okay after that i was pretty gowiththeflowy and managed to not let anxiety get to me my blood pressure did go down and they sent me home to be on bed rest just in case but i did it guys i have been so worried about getting that high pressure reading this pregnancy but i didnt panic,pre-pandemic

so im going to keep this as summarized as possible im currently 31 had the same job with the same friends from age 19 28 while at this job i was in a very very toxic relationship with a guy i met there he was my first true relationship but it was extremely toxic and manipulative i fell into a trauma bond with him and it took me forever to leave him at this time i had also lived with my parents my entire life while paying them rent i was comfortable with my job my friends and obviously living at home fast forward to 2021 i left that job cycled through a few more jobs that didnt work out stopped having a social life and my social anxiety began to skyrocket 8 months after leaving my job of 10 years i also finally broke up with my toxic ex it was the hardest thing ive ever done the day after i broke up with him i hung out with a guy i had known for a out a year we slept together and we have since been together for over 2 years today were in a good spot with our relationship we have an apartment together but i absolutely hate my current job and have no friends there i feel like im constantly stuck in the past and super depressed about how my life used to be does it ever get better i still miss living at home and miss the fun times i had with all my friends i have no social life anymore and my anxiety has gotten so bad since i left my first job i feel like im going through the motions of life completely numb,post-pandemic
im trying to do a lot within my career and personal life im working two jobs and also starting my business in the process i also go to the gym 5x a week and try to read every night im 22 and my full time employers became huge role modelsmentors in my life similar story in regards to how they got where they are and theyre multibusiness owners within a year of millionaire status they inspire me so much and theyre what prompted me to get a second job while im trying to start my business so i can have an extra check in the process but heres where the issues creep in for some reason ive gotten to the root of it and know the why but to me its still ridiculous in hindsight i get extremely triggered if i do something wrong at work need a course correction etc or if i see anything online relating to my trauma a post photo comment you name it the thing is when its really bad i end up acting like a complete fool trying to get shit done and trying to act normal in front of my employers this shit will knock me off my routine for days i say this as ive been sitting in the bathtub disassociating for 3 hours instead of doing my usual gymreadcreate content for my website like i should be doing ive had a total of 3 meals in the past two days i just go completely blank and shut down for days every single time i encounter a bad trigger ive tried deep breathing meditation journaling going on a walk and honestly pretty much all of it just makes me feel worse does anyone have something they personally do that can help me manage this better im trying my hardest to chase success and build a life for myself but i will honestly never accomplish anything if i keep letting it fuck up my entire system for days on end if anyone has any coping mechanisms that work for them im all ears,post-pandemic
i learned this concept last night and wanted to share you can think of success in life like a club were all trying to get into most people will go in the front door they stand in line wait their turn and work their way forward slowly but surely a select number of exclusive people get to use the back door the are the people who know the right person have the right reputation or could buy their way in but some people cant get in through the front or the back door they need the third door the third door is the unmarked way in its a window a fire escape a roof exit its hiding in the laundry cart when they bring in the linens or disguising yourself and going in the service entrance its a combination of timing ingenuity and effort but you can keep trying until you make it in i often need to remind myself that my route to success is different but that doesnt make it any less real the whole concept of run your own race has been reiterated to me so many times but i find it hard to stop comparing my path to others i have to remind myself just keep trying things never stop innovating ways around your problems fall down nine times and stand up ten i think i feel my best when im in lovable rogue mode because i know i dont feel good at all when im in trying to be normal mode find your third door people and remember if you get into the club you arent a fraud you deserve to be there just as much as anybody else edit holy moly this resonated please everybody keep sharing your stories and experiences maybe we all need to seeremember the breadth of possibility thats truly out there edit thank you u23wings for the original source its a book third door by alex banayan,pre-pandemic

specifically asking about the uk here but im happy to hear about other countries as well i remember like 810 years ago i was hearing about people getting regular weigh ins and actually offered appointments with a dietician meal plans the lot really but when i went to a doctor to try to get help and told them about my problems with eating and they just seemed to brush me off i cant even seem to get a face to face appointment anymore granted i wasnt there primarily for my ed but they didnt even address it i understand the nhs has become more strained but it seems like they dont even want to give us these appointments,post-pandemic

i feel like its very common for people to cycle through bingerestrict cycles but ive never really experienced that rather than bingerestrict its more like just restrictnot restrict i go through periods of eating a relatively normal healthy amount and then out of nowhere it gets super easy to restrict for a few weeks and there are so many reasons why this makes me feel like a fake whiney baby eating a normal amount makes me feel fake because i clearly am not repulsed by food and i dont have to force it down i enjoy it i mean during these periods my thoughts are exactly the same as when i restrict and i always would rather be restricting i feel the same guilt over the food i eat but i still eat it in the first place since developing an ed ive lost weight pretty consistently only gaining real weight when ive gone on vacation or during holidays but i lose weight slowly as fuck ive lost only 35lbs since last may and i have been having these disordered thoughts for almost the entire time but where the fuck am i suffering i clearly dont have an issue with the act of eating if i decided to recover i feel like it would be relatively easy for me because i fucking love food i feel like some wannarexic lmao i want to restrict 100 of the time and lose weight super quickly but i cant because i dont actually have an eating disorder im just forcing one even though ive restricted to the point where im underweight i just feel like i dont match any criteria for any eating disorders i have no binging or purging issues so i dont see how i could have ednos but i feel like i eat normally enough of the time for anorexia to be wrong as well part of the reason i want to lose even more weight at this point is because if im underweight enough then i know i have an eating disorder for sure this post is a mess lmao im just sick of my own bullshit and idk how common this is,pre-pandemic
i only have one real friend and i dont treat her well she likes to text often but ive gone days or weeks without texting her back but shes still a good friend to me the thing is in high school i went out to a dance with a group of girls my bff really didnt like one of the girls my bff never liked going to the events but i wanted to go and i didnt have anyone else to go with my bff said she was fine with me going but the next month at school she was avoiding me i sat alone at lunch and she was just very passive aggressive she apologized later it was kind of a half assed apology and i knew it i didnt really want to be her friend anymore but she kept texting me even after we graduated its been five years and im kind of emotionally checked out of the relationship,post-pandemic
wednesday evening i had a guy ive been seeing the last month or so come over to my place wed slept together before and id already felt relatively safe but this time i got triggered i dont know why maybe it was the stress but when he bit my leg something i usually enjoy i triggered and i started flailing and kicking then rolled over on my side and covered my face he was gentle and checked on me and i apologized and he pulled me in to cuddle after i calmed down a bit i said something about how we should talk about it he said that we didnt have to i dont disclose i was in denial of my rapes and abuse for years and when it all came out i told my boyfriend at the time wed been together for years we lived together i completely believed that he was going to be supportive instead he verbally abused me for hours told me i was a slut and a liar and other horrible things i have struggled with disclosure ever since and have missed out on potential relationships because my fear of disclosing makes me disconnected and withdrawn disclosure is a huge barrier for me but i disclosed i had to work myself up to it and he was patient he already knew i had ptsd so i said my ptsd comes from sexual assault and domestic violence i talked a little about it and explained my reaction i had to work myself up to it but i did it i was still very activated so i put on music and told him we should talk about other things to distract me so he let me show him all my gemstones i recently got he literally listened to me talk about rocks i managed to pull myself back and finish having sex with him and he was gentle even though i knew it wasnt his preference i kept apologizing to him about everything that happened and he told me it was okay and to stop apologizing this is a huge event for me disclosure to a sexual partner has never been successful for me most of the time it doesnt happen potential relationships have been impaired by my avoidance disclosure itself carries trauma for me ive been talking in therapy about how to disclose for years so this is a big deal for me and im proud of me i hope that this means ill start being able to have this discussion with more serious romantic partners and ill stop ruining relationships,pre-pandemic

i relapsed 48 days ago and of course its worse than ever and im talking going through a half gallon in 3 days the daily withdrawals have started getting bad and im worried about what will happen if i decide to stop drinking rehab isnt an option because of money and i stopped going to aa even before the relapse because it got too overwhelming naturally i cant skip work because i need to pay rent somehow but the withdrawal symptoms are getting awkward even if im not trying to get sober and just going through the daily withdrawals if i decide to get sober what is this going to be like with having to work yesterday i tried to refrain from drinking but it just too bad and i couldnt handle the symptoms any tips are appreciated,post-pandemic
i stopped taking my medication a few weeks ago and its starting to catch up to me im having a lot more flashbacks again and dissociation has been so bad nightmares jumpiness mood swings anxiety and depression everything is coming back i originally stopped taking my meds because i wanted to prove to myself that i didnt need substances to cope it makes me feel weak to think that i cant even handle my own brain without added chemicals im still young 19 and dont want to have to depend on anything for the rest of my life i know thats an incorrect way of thinking and medications can be wildly helpful for so many different reasons but ive been on them for years now and i just got sick of it also they kinda made me feel zombieish like i couldnt fully feel my emotions i want to prove to myself that i can live happily without assistance that i am stronger than my trauma but god its so hard most of what i think about now is my trauma i constantly am second guessing if what happened to me actually happened or not i constantly feel like crying in the past year or so ive resorted to substances to numb the memories out nothing extremely hard mostly just weed and even that is starting to not work my actual life is good right now for the first time in years and it makes me angry that i cant even fully enjoy it sure there are good days good moments but theres always that lingering knowledge of what happened to me is it dumb of me to stop my medication is it even possible for me to live comfortably without it and if so how can i achieve that on my own thank you for taking the time to read this,post-pandemic

its not the disease of drug addiction its the disease of addiction when i was in active addiction even as a hardcore addict i never believed addiction was a disease after all i made the choice to use drugs for the first time like so many of us which is most often the argument made by non believers however when i made the choice to work on my recovery i realized i am not just a drug addict i am an addict the drug addiction is not the disease its the disease of addiction disease of the mind diseased thinking i used to believe it was the drugs that were my only issue however now that i no longer use any mind altering substances ive come to realize that my thinking is the issue my obsessive compulsive hyper focused mind i now see clean that my disease will manifest itself in so many ways daily if i am not actively seeking my recovery as aggressively as i seeked my next fix ive come to realize i cannot do anything even the healthy things without it making my life unmanageable whether it be food the gym karate kick boxing yoga relationships and even my recovery too much of anything is not good for this guy and that is what makes me an addict that is the disease of addiction again not drug addiction as drugs were just a symptom of my disease i also look back on my life and realize i was an addict well before i tried my first drug including alcohol i was addicted to many things both healthy and unhealthy as a young kidteen i was always the child that could never stop after one pop tart or one oreo i had to have the whole box ultimately we must give up on the debate on whether it is a disease or not because all it does is divide us we create the division and that does not get us closer to resolving the issue of addiction and many issues that go on in the world we must come together because nearly everyone has been affected by addiction one way or another and some of us havent even come to realize it yet so whether you feel pity for the addict in active addiction or not is irrelevant whether you believe its a disease or not is also irrelevant all i ask is that you try to understand that it is everywhere around us and when that person you love comes clean and asks for help put your pride and ego aside and lend them your hand because my hand will always be out for anyone who needs it,pre-pandemic

ive always find it weird that only women tend to be diagnosed with bpd since its a mental disorder and can affect anyone ive been thinking that its maybe because men are expected to be more macho and stoic by society and also testosterone filled which makes their symptoms manifest as aggresion violence anger issues and substance issues which would look really similar to aspd and maybe they get misdiagnosed a lot are there any men here with bpd if yes what are your symptoms edit sorry shouldve worded it better female predominant not femalespecific,post-pandemic

ive been a long time lurker in here cause ive found it helpful and its what pushed me to finally get tested for adhd i got the results back yesterday and the psychiatrist said i dont have adhd rather i have cognitive deficit in concentration and she also used the term concentration deficit disorder she said the above disorder is treated the same way as adhd with medication the reason im questioning it is because in one part of the testing it said im able to inhibit impulsive behavior but in the conclusion she wrote this is a valid testing protocol suggesting intact cognitive functioning with impairments in cognitive processing and executive functioning difficulty with impulsivity information organization and retrieval task monitoring and task initiation were noted specific difficulty with attention was not clearly identified however cognitive processing was notably slower than other cognitive abilities suggesting difficulty with the ability to maintain engagement with cognitive tasks long term this type of difficulty can often appear similar to adhd symptoms and may also benefit from medication management as directed by redacted primary care provider icd10 diagnostic hypotheses primary diagnosis cognitive deficit in concentration slowed cognitive processing doesnt this seem like it contradicts itself and i should get a second opinion or should i just take the diagnosis and try medication and see if it helps i appreciate all feedback and i can provide more information if needed,post-pandemic

weed sends me into paranoid episodes where i heavily disassociate or think someone is trying to hurt me and no matter how much i assert that ive always had bad experiences with weed people continue to suggest it to me as this like magical cure for all my symptoms someone even told me to stop going to therapy and just smoke instead lol im really glad that it helps some people a lot but its honestly not for everyone edit i see some people misinterpreting my point so ill say again that im not implying that weed or other substances dont help people its just hurtful when people refuse to take no for answer and try to pressure you to do it whether thats through friends or dms im glad some people have good experiences and want other people to as well but its not helpful to nag someone about it if they say no especially when its a stranger,pre-pandemic
i just started a new job a few weeks ago and out of nowhere i got really sick body ache cold sores coughing and then i couldnt stop throwing up i feel bad cause i just started but i know they were staffed properly it just makes me feel guilty my coworker seemed uncomfortable with me coughing and sneezing the last day i went in she wears a mask and we work in a small area together thats part of the reason ive called in for 3 days besides the fact that i can barely go 30 minutes without throwing up i feel like my manager is mad at me but idk what to tell her,post-pandemic
this is a new medication for me i dont wanna wait too long and i dont want to take it too soon around how long before i go somehwere anxiety enduring should i take one thank you also how often is too often to take it i havent been taking it every time ive needed it because of how much pressure my peers have been putting on me not to abuse it i have zero desire to take it more than needed it just doesnt sound enjoyable i do not have an addictive personality no hate or judgement to those who do though,post-pandemic
ahhh anyone else extremely frustrated with how many medications result in weight gain i had to lie to my therapist and psychiatrist that lexapro wasnt working for me when the real reason was because i had gained a lot of weight in a short amount of time i feel so guilty and upset that im valuing my weight over my mental health but i keep telling myself that the weight gain will only make me more depressed i got prescribed an antipsychotic today but after reading other redditors experiences im just way too afraid to take it my psychiatrist suggested other medications as well but that they have a side effect of weight gain and he said but i wouldnt recommend them for you and that comment is just making me more insecure and torn about taking the medication,post-pandemic

my bf was sober without help starting about 10 months ago a bit before we started dating hes incredible and genuinely weve not had a single problem it feels like a fairy tale and hes very driven and emotionally intelligent and i believe honest last week he relapsed i think he was in denial before now because hed told me it was due to his drinking being problematic but that he is absolutely not an alcoholic because the issue hasnt ever been daily drinking he was drinking for a whole week before he agreed to let me get him help and call his family he then agreed to detox and treatment and has verbally committed to aa and counseling when he is out i talked to his family and so im 110 that im up to date on his use history my friends want me to dump him over this i feel like because he was able to be sober for so long before without help he likely will do much better with all of this support and ongoing help after i have told him us being together is contingent on him continuing to seek help after all this and that in the meantime i wont go anywhere i also feel that if hed had more education and support this was a preventable relapseguy just bought a house and has been very financially stressed and its his first time living alone so theres not that accountability he also was training for a double marathon and was doing long runs daily but then got hurt a month ago and all activity stopped i want to give him a shot is that crazy i need a reality check or validation here,post-pandemic
okay so i graduated university my gpa isnt stellar as adhd did interfere with my ability to memorize boring information and spit it back out onto a piece of paper one area where i was strong in was finance and accounting math in general really i am currently in the process of applying for jobs and finding it somewhat difficult to get taken seriously because of my lower gpa 26 overall 335 accounting gpa my question is rather than explain it from the view of oh adhd interfered with my ability to memorize hence the low marks has anyone actually came out and said in a application that one of their main strengths is the fact theyre diagnosed with adhd i mean personally i think adhd is a gift from god we have a powerful brain that sometimes gets a little carried away i know in some positions it actually gives me a competitive edge sales for instance i am pretty certain that mentioning a bold statement like that will make you stand out however i dont know if the person on the other end will see it the same way i see it endrant tl dr i have adhd i believe its a strength to me more so than a weakness would it be smart to throw a statement on my application cover letter saying that it is something valuable i can bring to the table,pre-pandemic
im a music student taking a beginner piano course and in that course we had to compose an original piece and perform it publicly i was super excited about this assignment and for the past couple of weeks i worked super hard on it i mean i spent like 2 hours in the practice rooms every day for about a week and a half i was really happy with it and the performance went pretty well i thought i would do really well on it so i was really excited to get my grade back as i have been academically achieving literally nothing lately and this was something i was functional enough to actually work hard on and enjoy i got my mark back and its a 61 i didnt even get a passing grade i got perfect marks on every part of it except for inversionsvoice leading which i got a zero on because i forgot to write them into my score i emailed my prof and she stated she didnt see me doing inversions during the performance i even named the ones that i did and she just denied it and said my score confirmed that thats what i did i thought i actually did something right this time but of course i fucked up on the one thing that actually mattered i dont know what to do now im just really sad,post-pandemic

hi so my adhd girlfriend is having a hard time reminding herself that she needs to take her adhd meds because she gets easily distracted or she has a difficult time planning ahead and this has been reflected on her control over her birthcontrol medication that she is taking to help against her acne my question is what can she do i have set her phone to remind her at the same time every day to take her medication but she has a hard time thinking ahead so sometimes we will be out and about and she forgets her bag with the medication i wondered if a phone case or pouch for the birth control exists or something you know i just want it to be effortless because its become obvious she just is very forgetful when it comes to her meds as a whole,post-pandemic

they say this i am adhd so you are attention deficit hyperactivity disorder then okay carry on edit why all the downvotes if youre seriously saying that you are the disorder itself then that means this bob claims that he is sooooo adhd so bob adhd i have adhdc i have bob type c also youre probably talking to someone who thinks adhd is a placeholder for some trivial personality trait like distracted or forgetful and to anyone who thinks it is heres a hint its not edit 2 on a more sentimental note i think i know why you guys are downvoting me is it about how someone with adhd might not be able to tell the difference between themselves and their adhd because their adhd affects them so drastically you know what i get it my adhd has screwed me over time and time again so much so that im starting to believe that its all i have and all i am in my case its led me to believe that im a failure my adhd shapes and has shaped who i am without adhd i wouldnt be me thats never going to change but it doesnt have to remain that way i dont have to be adhd i can be better than that with the proper treatment and support no one has to be adhd but i understand how i could have been misunderstood by some of you guys people say you arent your disorder but asking how adhd has affected my life is like asking how my parents shaped my life i cant point fingers but my parents shaped my life and defined who i am as a person adhd didnt make me who i am but it definitely made me into what i am and how i am a post by ugedalya,pre-pandemic

today we were talking about how i have problems regulating emotions and i tend to overreact because i want people to hear me and acknowledge me personally when i have fits of rage i want to be seen and heard its like a child throwing a temper tantrum to get mommys attention she told me that its like when you and someone else are standing side by side in front of a house you start to smell smoke and you turn to the other person to tell them you think theres a fire they say no no theres no fire you then start to see the smoke and you turn to them and say no look theres definitely a fire going once again the other person says nah no there isnt you see the flames engulfing the house and once again say no cant you see the fire right there the other person blows you off once more finally you just cant take it anymore and scream look at the damn fire its right in front of you by being invalidated by other people in your life by having you express your feelings and people in your life saying that it isnt right or you shouldnt feel that way it makes you feel unacknowledged thats why the freak outs happen you just want to be heard you want validation over your thoughts and feelings idk i just through this was profound and made me look at things in a new way i thought it might help someone else so i decided to share,pre-pandemic

i realize everyone around me has their own mental issues personal demons and disorders such as ptsd alcoholism narcissism eating disorders depression paranoia substance use disorder and child abuse among many others these people with their mental issues and disorders dont understand those of us with autism why each of us have our personal demons and rather then trying to fight each other about it we should support each other and have each others back is it because they dont care or just seems focus on themselves,post-pandemic
its super annoying how frequently people come here and ask things like i drink 3 glasses of wine 4 times per week am i an alcoholic first of all thats not nearly enough information to diagnose you the amount that you drink and the frequency of your drinking arent really the biggest factors in determining whether or not youre an alcoholic depending on your weight and genetics you could might be able to drink a fifth of booze a night with no ill effects or a single beer might knock you on your ass here are the real questions you need to ask yourself have you suffered consequences as a result of your drinking do you keep drinking anyway okay then youre probably an alcoholic now quit asking,post-pandemic

so none of you may have seen me post here as im quite new but im in some need of advice first though im going to give some background on how i was diagnosed and why i joined this subreddit first off how it all started and when i was eventually diagnosed it all started when i was 16 i dont remember what year as im not good with time but im 19 now anyways when i was 16 we had quite a year on top of past trauma i had already been dealing with at the time my family and i went through a house fire after which all the progress i had made on my mental health up to that point had floped it was mind shattering for me almost like a flip getting switched in my brain i had went from losing almost everything to losing everything i became slow zoned out and i often found myself overthinking more and more over time just sliding back down not able to stop myself the next year was pure chaos i had just recently been working on myself keeping my room clean showering just doing basic requirements to live but after the house fire its like it all slowly but surely came to a halt i started forgetting or entirely pushing it off started to hide in my room dropped out of school as it felt like everyone at school was talking about me or thinking negatively about me in their head if they would look my way almost as if i would talk for them and i just started becoming i dont even know what i often would get mad at my own family as i would think they were talking about me behind closed doors i would burst into rooms if i thought i heard my name sometimes i would hear my name in conversations that werent even about me and then on top of it all it seemed like people wouldnt understand what i was saying sometimes and i myself would have no idea where the topic had gone i would go from talking about what i did that day to how our dog chewy died a long time ago and then go straight to talking about getting my motorcycle license and then after all that talking just walk away to my room where i would sit there listening to music for hours on end while picking at my fingernails or the floor or staring at the ceiling i started to chip away at my relationships with family and my at the time girlfriend and then even more happened my girlfriend at the time decided to press the off switch on herself i sank further into what i assumed to be at the time depression but not much changed i just became a recluse in my room but my relationships continued to deteriorate as i could barely hold a job going on my 18th birthday i cant really remember much as i was in what i would call a mentalcoma at the time cant ever really remember much actually but anyways now to how i got to the diagnosis so i moved up to nebraska in october after my 19th birthday with a few random friends i was deep into whatever this mental illness caused i moved because i thought my family was financially abusing me even though they obviously werent so i just packed and took a train the next week i got a job up in nebraska but was deteriorating the relationships i had up there as well as i couldnt think about anyone but myself i would also tell my upstairs neighbor when i would go to hangout with him that my roommates hated me and were threatening to kick me out even though the things said by them werent even remotely close to what they probably said eventually i just ran i thought i was getting kicked out one night after one of them yelled at me for letting our upstairs neighbor my friend into the apartment without their permission and that same friend was going to take me back home to my family my mom agreed to it and not even 30 minutes into heading back she calls me and says the words yohr sisters dont want you back here i freaked out and panicked i dont even remember the situation very clearly but i know that i ended up at a mental health facility after my friend said i probably needed it so i admitted myself and spoke with the psychiatrist the next couple of weeks trying to figure out why i was empty isolative erratic and so on and as well as me speaking to the psychiatrist the psychiatrist was speaking to my roommate that i added as a emergency contact and release of information as well as my mother they explained a lot of what i couldnt and i dont know how they came to the decision but i was diagnosed with schizophrenia still dont know how or why im just confused really and im hoping someone with somewhat similar experiences could offer advice or explain how to handle it and mend the bridges ive burned because of my paranoia in all honesty i dont know what exactly im expecting to get out of this i think i just needed to get it out,post-pandemic

im a 15 year old addict from florida this is my story my spelling is really bad im sorry hey im reaching out because i feel stranded i used to feel lonely but now im separated from my family my friends and im sitting in iss at my boarding school in utah i feel so weak and hopeless at this point i feel like im crazy im fucked in the head so my using began about two years ago i was in 7th grade when i smoked weed for the first time i was with some older friends of mine at the time and we were smoking at the community playground late at night for my first time i ended up taking two bong rips and packing a few bowls i coughed for what seemed like 10 minutes after the coughing had ended i had finally felt the effects i was high really high and i loved it i felt lifted i was happy and we were all having a great time we all hung around the park laughing with each other for about an hour and then we decided to go back to their house where we would be spending the night this friend of mine also happened to be my little sisters friends older brother when we walked into the house we all reeked like bud my eyes were red and i was paranoid as fuck while walking back into the bedroom i had tripped over the dog gate that was separating the two sides of the house my sister and her friend came out of their room and they knew something was up at this point i was scared so i came clean to my sister and she called my dad my dad came picked me up brought me home and then shaved off all of my hair as a punishment this was just the beginning after this punishment i had been scared to ever get in trouble for drugs ever again so i finished that school year and the next without ever touching anything and it wasnt until freshman year of highschool that i had started to begin vaping nicotine i continued to do solely only use nicotine for about another month then i started to vape thc and use wax carts like every other highschooler in america i would get high every day before my sports practices games when i woke up in school before bed it was constant i began to see myself differently i became more depressed than i already was and my using that was recreational and social soon became a way of self medicating i began to drink alcohol every single day i would steal from convienent stores and my dads liquor cabinet i would get crossfaded every single day with no regard whatsoever and on christmas eve i got so drunk under my moms supervision that she had temporarily lost custody of me and my sisters the drinking and smoking went on for about another 5 months and then i started to experiment with lsd and i began to abuse that me and my friends went on an acid binge for about a week over winter break we all fell in love with acid at this time and we had said that it changed our lives but on the last day of this binge i had my first bad trip this experience was horrorfying my vision consisted of a kaleidoscope made up of faces that had red eyes and sharp teeth staring at me i was extremely paranoid and i was scared out of my mind this 12 hours of madness changed me forever fast forward about another month or so i continued to drink and smoke daily alongside the usual vaping and then one night i had ran away from home as a result of my dad posting an embarassing picture of me online with my dilated pupils staring into the camera i walked about 7 miles to an abandoned house that me and my homies would hang out at i ended up getting a ride to my other friends house from one of my dealers and then that next day me and my friend whos house i stayed at that night went to school the next day and i had my cart on me as usual along with some bud it was in 4th period that two cops and the hall monitor showed up to my classroom and asked to speak with me they brought me down to their office where they had told me there was a report of me having illegal drugs on campus i was searched and i was found with the bud and the cart i was expelled from all of the schools in my county and i was going to be brought down to the juvenile assesment center for my arrest of possesion of a controlled substance where i would get my mugshot taken along with all my finger prints etc etc but i had told the transporter that i was depressed and that i was thinking about killing myself i was brought down to the local hospital where i stayed in the mental health unit for 5 days then brought to get my assesment done right after that then brought to a real mental health hospital when i told the lady doing my assesment that i wanted to die i was in this hospital for 8 days where i slept on the floor for 5 of the days since i was on suicide watch on the 7th day i had received a phone call from my mom she told me that i was ordered to go to rehab by the court i left for rehab on my 8th day and i was in residential treatment for 7 weeks i left rehab and i was then going to be living with my grandparents temporarily i wasnt in school at this time and i started to work i was working two jobs one as a dishwasher and the other being a construction job i was on a probation program and i was going to be getting tested monthly i got around this by using otc drugs such as dph dxm and dramamine i didnt really like these drugs but i had used them since it was all i could get figuring that i didnt have a cell phone and i was living in a different area i also picked up cigarettes instead of vaping i prefer smokin cigs since its more of a ritual and i felt like it soothed me i would continue to overdose on benadryl every single night i began to develop a high tolerance for dph and i wouldnt be able to sleep at night if i didnt take at least 15 of them i ended up having a severe panic attack that resulted in me running away from my grandparents house to a neighbors house asking to use their phone so that i could call my mom my mom came and picked me up and i went on to live with her for about two weeks we were going to aa meetings together and i made it seem like i was getting my shit together this was a lie since i was starting to use dxm nightly smoke and drink daily and then start to use acid again this resulted in me running away again and putting myself into the mental hospital i stole two scripts of gabapentin from my moms friend and a box of zzzquil from a gas station and i took the entire box of zzquil and 1500mg of gaba when the cops had found me sitting outside the hospital i was bakeracted for 7 days this time and afterwords i had finally gone back home to my dad while i was living with my dad i had a cell phone and i had began to get my connections back alongside new connections i started seeking out more drugs harder ones i started to abuse everything i was abusing amphetamines like adderall and vyvanse xanax molly acid various painkillers dilaudid percs oxys tramadol hydros vicodin otcs dph dxm dramamine cocaine i experimented with heroin and spice at one point and i had done other drugs unintentionally like mda nbome and im sure a few others i was going to places that i didnt want to be i started selling drugs to pay for my habbit and i was robbing people when i was broke but i can always find a way to get high no matter where i am or how much money i had i would crush up stolen medication and my own medication and i would snort those to get a dirty pharma high i would take a shit ton of benadryl with my painkillers to potentiate them i would mix anything and everything regardless of the risks associated with it as long as i got the best high i became an addict i ended up committing some serious crimes where i had stabbed a local dealer i vandalized a kids house doing 14k in damages i was hurting myself and the people around me i was back in school and then that had only lasted about two weeks until i got kicked out of that school when i popped two bars and drank half a bottle of wine the night prior and showed up hungover as a result of all this i was sent to a wilderness therapy program in southern utah i was there for 11 weeks and i just got out last thursday this was my longest time being sober and it was for 78 days i have torn apart my family and put them at risk i disrespected my girlfriend and her family by selling drugs out of their house i have become even more ill and unstable and at times i cant even trust myself im struggling with my identity and i feel so lost im too scared to come out as bisexual to my parents and to the people at my school i feel like i cant talk about the voices that i hear in my head while im alone i feel like im way to indecisive and my mood constantly changes i am alone and i just want to be with the people i love i need stability thank you for reading if youve made it this far i love you 3 xoxo,pre-pandemic

after braking up with my ex i became homeless and was staying with a friend my ex was abusive while we lived together and i have a problem with stopping substances when using them more so in the past im trying to be better now for my new relationship everyone knew this and the friend i was staying with also knew this as i told them so many times while drunk and sobbing my heart out about past abuse of every kind shed always make me drunk more and then we would apparently have sex but i could barely remember any of the times i said yes and im scared that she did assault me as well i mean i know she did because i never remember saying yes half the time and i also remember shed be pushy about doing it and would say stuff like she wouldnt be able to this when she leaves and stuff i just dont wanna think someone who was ment to help me would hurt me after i told her how many times other have done the same thing to me im so scared of what this is doing to me i feel so guilty because i should kf seen this happening and i should of stopped drinking as often and i should of known better but i still let it happen i feel so stupid and useless because i couldnt remember anything about what happened at hers i have little to no memory of staying with her it never ends for me she made drinks really strong and would always make us drink a lot she was bigger then me and can handle alcohol better then me and after that i dont remember even when others would tell her we should stop and have a brake wed wait and then shed suggest we drink more so i did is it my fault because i like to drink was i asking for it because i was drinking i feel so ducking dirty because of this theres nothing i can do about it because when i tried talking to them i messed up by acting like i did when i was a kid and saying whatever would make the other person not hate me or something i feel so useless because of this no matter where i go i feel like someone will always take advantage of me because it seems like thats all that happens when i was a kid and now as an adult 19at the time does it ever stop i feel like i can even be alone without feeling guilty and i dont even know why i feel guilty i didnt do anything wrong i hate being alone and sober now i want to sh again but i wont and i cant because i promised my bf i wouldnt because its not good and shit whatever i just want this all to go away and to not feel like this i wish i didnt remember anything anymore i miss not being able to remember stuff and it all just being not there it hurts so much i cant take it am i really that easy to take advantage of still why cant i stop this from happening no matter what i do it wont stop i cant stop thinking about all of the times i was assaulted and it makes me feel so gross and dirty and all i wanna do is hurt myself so much i dont even want to wake up half the time but i do be abuse then i get to be with my bf hes been the only thing thats made me feel less dirty about myself because he doesnt care and he doesnt see me differently and he understands what i feel like i just wish i didnt feel so bad when hes not here i want to be able to just be normal again if it wasnt for him i wouldnt feel so normal he talks to me and asks me how im feeling he takes care of me and never asks for to much and he even takes care of me when my disability flares badly i dont know what id do without him i just hate myself for what happened i didnt want it i just wanted to have fun and drink and get over a bad relationship but no,post-pandemic
my roommate is an alcoholic and i have no idea what to do he does good about not drinking till the weekend hits then he blacks out all weekend he destroys the house during the weekends he is supposedly trying the sinclair method but that isnt working he is also supposedly taking naltrexone also he occasionally drinks on weekdays too but the last time he did that his work almost fired him so he cut that shit out in the past year he has gone into the wrong apartment had an ambulance called on him had firefighters find him refused to leave ubers got lost on the way home not remembered our address at least 5 times broken a ton of plates just by dropping them while trying to cook drunk tried to eat the food with the broken plates aka eating broken glass and food mixed together called every female on his phone to tell them he is an alcoholic and a sex addict unfortunately the list keeps going and going i have him on my lease for 5 more months he is one of my oldest friends too so it sucks to see him like this i told his parents and they were devastated and it seems like that wont even stop him he says hell do aa and other programs too but not even that helps what the hell do i do edit grammar,post-pandemic

sometimes i just think about everything and want to vent but theres so much to say and i dont know who to tell it to without being annoying or disturbing im in therapy but still sometimes i just want to vent to friends but theres so much to say and most of it is dark i remember random things sometimes and keep thinking about them but cant really let it out because its just not something you say in a casual conversation so it just stays repeating in my mind,pre-pandemic
i have a serious question im a 26f ive been using iv heroin probably fetty now since i was 16 yes i started using the needle at 16 unfortunately but ive never overdosed and its really weird to me lol i kinda want to tbh i shoot 46 bags at a time on the regular and nothing the worse i get is like heart palpations are the heart palpations a sign that the time is close i just want to know because i want to plan accordingly i live with my boyfriend who does not use and never has i want to let him know the signs of an od and what he should do i dont want him to call 911 call me crazy but i really believe that if god or whom ever thinks its my time to go then its my time to go but anyways i just wonder cause everyone on this sub has oded so many times and ive never experienced it not once but itd be kinda nice if i did just fall asleep forever what are the symptoms you feel before oding i guess thats a better question to ask,post-pandemic
26f ive always had this feeling like no one cares i grew up with my mum and dad they met my physical needs but i was emotionally neglected my brother died as a baby when i was 9 and i was left to deal with the grief alone i remember crying in my bed every night not understanding what was happening i knew i felt pain and i knew my parents felt pain but it was like i had to figure it out on my own i only saw my mum cry once or twice not even at the funeral and my dad cried a lot and dealt with it by punching holes in walls etc i remember thinking that i was attention seeking when i was in school at the anniversary of his death because i was upset i was confused if i was actually feeling upset or doing it for attention and i still feel like that now when i get upset i had an okay relationship with my mum and dad but i wasnt very deep they wouldnt ask me questions about school activities holidays etc and that always used to upset me because i wanted them to be interested in my life in 2020 my dad took his own life and it was a very traumatising 2 week span of him being missing until his body was found i found forum posts from his email where he said he didnt feel like he had a relationship with any of his kids this is a short overview for background but i just dont have any close friends or family a lot of friends in the past have backstabbed me and since then i dont seem to know how to get beyond kinda friends kinda acquaintances it always fizzles out now im at a point where i feel like there is no one really invested in my life yet i feel like i am always the first to invest my time in other peoples lives then i start spiralling thinking am i a narcissist do i even give other people enough time i think i do but then i get so confused how to even have any friends i really feel like if i died tomorrow people would be sad but it wouldnt interfere that much in anyones life because no one is really interconnected to my life in that way can anyone relate to this i dont even know why im posting it ive just become more honest with myself about mental health issues or something that may be contributing it makes m feel incredibly lonely,post-pandemic

i have schizoaffective bipolar type so i take a antidepressants or in my case two and a mood stabilizer seroquel anytime my meds change or im without the meds i was on mainly seroquel my symptoms come back fast and i start to get really paranoid and have strong delusions they go away as soon as i start taking the medication again however i only take 2575mg of seroquel a night depends which is extremely low on average considering the start for many people is 300400 the main reason i dont go any higher than 75 mg is cause the drowsiness side effects are too much to handle but im still very much content where its at im not sure if i am just sensitive ive talked about it my main psychiatrist and they dont understand why but it also makes problems when talking to other medical professionals and they question me whether my diagnosis is legit even when i know it is if anyone experiences the same things as me i would love to know so i dont feel as alone,post-pandemic

in a depressive episode currently and every time i look at my wonderful smart strong baby girl 9m i start to get sad shes such a smiley and content baby but gets a shit cocktail of genetic predisposition for depression anxiety and bipolar disorder i feel guilty and scared i also dont want her to carry the weight of mental illness the way i had to carry my moms im terrified of her ever feeling it is her fault im sad does anyone have recommendations for books to talk to children about a parent with bipolar disorder or even just generic poor mental health any age range is fine its a ongoing conversation we will have throughout her life but it would help to know in advance what tools there are,post-pandemic
and i am gradually withering away because of it mental health professionals never take me seriously i can see it in the hint of amusement in their eyes their disengaged body language their patronising tone of voice they say im too welldressed too articulate too intelligent i am too kind i smile too often im too calm this has not only been offensive to me but it is such an insult to people who are mentally ill and suicidal their implication that suicidal people are dumb frenzied and rude slobs was and still is fucking preposterous i have tried to get help for approximately 8 years i have begged and pleaded and been reduced to tears but unless im trying to end my life right now in front of them it doesnt matter none of it matters i dont matter my public face is too convincing but this was carefully created and crafted over many years because i had no choice i had no option but to hide the abuse and isolation and pain i have suffered behind a smile i was never given an alternative and when someone glimpsed the reality behind this faade they did nothing the truth is a part of me is frightened of dying and my survival instincts kick in when i dont want them to but that doesnt mean i want to live either if i could switch off this deeply ingrained fear and just be done with it i would why do we have to kill ourselves or almost die before people care why do we have to present ourselves in a specific way before we even get listened to why do they wait until every glimmer of hope and willingness to live has been stamped out i hate this i hate my life i hate myself let me be what they want me to be please edit i never ever ever consider others as dumb frenzied rude slobs by the way im so sorry if i made anyone feel that way its simply how i interpret the reaction of mental health professionals when they say but youre so cleverhygienicprettywellgroomed etc it feels like a slap in the face as though suicidal people are looked down on if they are well presented and looked down on if they are not too but the latter apparently ticks more boxes from their point of view if someone is unkempt hasnt showered is visibly distressed or less coherent i do not judge them or advocate doing so but using someones appearance as a way of invalidating their pain thats completely wrong edit 2 thank you everyone for your supportive comments and sharing your experiences on this subject it means a lot to me and although it is awful that this resonates with so many people it also brings me comfort i am sorry for not responding to everyone yet if you have had a similarly invalidating experience i am so sorry i appreciate the difficulty internalising this but it is not your fault you are not to blame for the misconduct of any medical professional who ought to know better than to belittle us during our darkest and most vulnerable moments in positive developments the crisis team visited me at home this evening both mental health nurses listened to me emphasised that the way i was treated for the last 8 years was unacceptable completely validated my feelings and showed a lot of empathy it has restored a little bit of faith in the nhs they are going to report back to the psychiatry team and recommend that i be allocated a care coordinator who will be able to assist me with being prescribed the correct forms of treatment and provide support with finances and social connections i have not allowed myself to anticipate too much but i cried with relief after they left i hope they keep their word i hope they meant it i desperately just hope until i receive an outcome i will sincerely try to stay alive i am not in a position to promise that i will survive but i can promise that i will try one more time,pre-pandemic
ive always been this way always since i was a kid i feel what i think may be a bit too much sympathy for those who are in the wrong it always comes from a place of if this were me and i did that thing that would be awful for example i was watching a crime documentary yesterday and thought im so glad im not a murderer that would be really difficult to deal with it must be really hard and scary being in jail way before i ever thought about how sad and scary it must be for the victim and the victims family it makes me feel awful afterwards when i realize but i cant help my line of thinking,post-pandemic

i got the call at 3am from my sister i knew this call would come eventually but it didnt make it hurt any less he was 33 years old and im 37 we both had it rough growing up with addict parents and a broken family but he dove right into that lifestyle after dropping out of high school i reached out to help many times while maintaining boundaries but he never really wanted help badly enough to get it i hope that one day he would want help so i could help him help himself but that day never came anyway if you have an addict friend or loved one give them a call and just tell them you love them because you dont know when itll be the last time you talk to them last time we spoke he called me ne wished me a happy birthday ill never get to talk to him again that fact hasnt even set in yet but i loved him dearly and hate what this disease did to him edit i just want to thank everyone for their kindness this process of burying my brother has been much more difficult than losing my mother and father our parents were addicts as well and we battled our way through a rough childhood together to come out alive unfortunately he took the wrong path as an adult and it caught up to him rip christopher wilson,pre-pandemic

after several unsuccessful attempts at quitting drinking this is by far the longest stretch i have gone without drinking since going to prison which i did drink a little there but only once or twice and barely felt anything anyways since starting 20 years ago oddly enough it was the night nipsey hussle died where i drank myself to stupidity and then decided to get sober the day after and im not the biggest rap fan i still smoke weed and am sort of a slacker though i need to get a good job but am making ends meet barely by being frugal mostly cheers you all i hope that you all have a blessed day and find some sort of peace and clarity without the effects of alcohol destroying your soul drink by drink,pre-pandemic
i was born and raised in a third world country and left at 18 to study abroad that is when i got diagnosed with clinical depression i dont know if i had it since before but as far as i remember i always had suicidal ideations i did 2 years of therapy and came back home because of covid which meant i had to stop everything now i am in another country to start anew in a new field of studies however i am not feeling any better i have been there for three years now took medications for a year while doing therapy my mental health is in total decay and i stopped everything at once during covid i started learning spanish again and met a guy on an language exchange app we became really good friends however with time and constant contact i caught feelings for him we would spend hours talking on the phone and messaging almost everyday i knew he did not have any feelings for me i ended up meeting him last summer in his hometown and i realized i truly was in love however because of many things that happened i ended up cutting contact i wrote him a farewell letter a few months later trying to get rid of my feelings for him i was used to being depressed but i did not know how to cope with rejection especially when thinking that he was not fair to me and did not respect my boundaries i guess i was waiting for him to apologise for how he treated me i just stopped eating and sleeping i started doing drugs i smoke cigarettes packs each week months passed and he contacted me again a couple weeks ago to insult me all this time all these months i was crying and begging god to take me with him for a man that even though told me i was his soulmate knew nothing about me he accused me of harassing him online i didnt know how to react or defend myself all this time i was wondering why he did not answer my letter if he already forgot about me but he spent it hating me i dont know how to cope i dont know how to live anymore i am looking for ways to leave quietly as i am a coward i think this is going to be the last piece of my existence that i leave in this world i dont know what to do nothing is getting better i cant even look forward to anything anymore the only man ive ever had feelings for and thought i deeply connected with thinks i am some hateful crazy b and my depression is eating me i wish i never downloaded this app i wish i could just disappear,post-pandemic
this is certainly an inevitable recovery moment but god i want to quit recovery so badly right now im just laying here thinking about how i miss all of my behaviors and im just so not okay with all the changes ive had to make and i just want to go back i wish i could just go back to my behaviors and have it magically not impact my health at all i feel like im not gonna win either path i choose either way ill hate myself all the same,post-pandemic
i have always been so baffled by my own life because i have been through a lot of extremely negative experiences outside of my control and powered through them but i am absolutely awful at coping with minor inconveniences if a friend has to cancel on me or does something that lets me down i feel sad and disappointed and it spirals out of control its taken me a long time to realize that the reason that its so hard for me to deal with these moments is that i am aware that i shouldnt be reacting to them in such an extreme way i obviously recognize that shit just happens and the world isnt out to get me people will always disappoint me in some way and its not always their fault if people do something that disappoints me but i feel strong emotions all of the time and i cant just turn them off so when i feel strong emotions in response to something minor i am so ashamed and angry at myself for feeling those strong emotions that it spirals out of control when really bad things happen to me i feel like my emotions are valid and that allows me to work through the situation without breaking down this is why it is so important to remind ourselves that emotions themselves are valid yes we feel very extreme emotions in situations when other people might not feel those emotions but that doesnt mean that theres something fundamentally wrong with us it just is what it is,pre-pandemic

hey 21 m and ive always had a shitty time trying to find love i guess but recently its been harder then ever i guess ill start from the beginning ive always been a shorter guy with some weight on me knowing that i didnt have the best attributes i became the funny self depricating type when i went through middleschool and highschool which didnt really help with getting a parter but it got me into lots of friend groups with people in relationships i honestly didnt really have anything happen sexual wise until i graduated and lost my virginity im now 21 and although ive had some sexual experiences ive never had a relationship and i constantly feel undesirable and unlikeable i try going on dating apps but i dont match with anyone to the point where i was spending money on the premium versions of apps i try going out and talking to people but it always feels like im not enough i hate talking about how lonely i am because it feels like i sound like an incel but i feel like i have alot to offer im fairly built now still chunky but more bulky now id like to think that i have good tastes and a good personality and i have a stable job with my priorities set but every night i scroll and see happy relationships and it bothers me that ive never had anything like that in my life ill match with someone and get ghosted after saying hey or asking about their interests im in my early 20s and im supposed to be having the time of my life but i just feel like a loser all the time and so envious of others it just makes me feel like whats so bad about me like why cant i have a crappy relationship or a good one or just someone thats interested in me and i guess since i missed the whole dating part of highschool and college i enlisted right out of highschool i just dont know how to interact with people in a romantic setting if that makes any sense alot has happend since i graduated and i hate being the kind of person that is looking for self pity from others or that looks weak which is why im posting this on reddit instead of talking with someone about it,post-pandemic

it really bothers me that people talk about mental health awareness but they just talk about anxiety depression or whatever but not psychosis or schizophrenia when thats an illness that can destroy whoevers life im not saying depression or anxiety are not important but come on psychotic illnesses are pretty serious and affect more people than what everyone thinks this situation should really change if we actually want to create authentic mental health awareness,pre-pandemic

welp i went to family therapy to try to work out all the demons caused by my parents for covering up my brothers repeated violent sexual assault of me when i was a child from the ages of 514 our family had always unusual dynamics that much was clear a genre of abuse could be spotted with some time spent around my parents and not the masks they put on for the guests their true screaming you bring me nothing but problems youre destroying the family i wish i never had kids i wish i was dead selves we went to therapy and i had suspected the truth but i could not believe it until i had confirmation my brothers abuse has been hid from everyone in his life including his wife to ask an oblique question i asked my mom what would you do if you found out dad was a pedohpile my question was to her but my eyes were on him the shock my heart sank i gave my brother an out not an excuse to explain the chain of abuse did dad sexually assault you crawled out of me yes it was the weakest most pathetic thing i had ever seen but it was the truth i had worn down their defences i am going no contact with two people now my mom is a victim of abuse herself but grew up in the 50s and also had her story brushed aside that set an example for her shes now brushed aside her husbands and sons acts knowingly just to keep the family reputation i was the sacrifice for the cogs i have never felt more old or more tired,pre-pandemic

disclaimer i began therapy less than a year ago and have only ever been to one therapist so my experience is very limited i have no idea if this will help others or apply to anyone elses situation but since reading it would have helped me i thought id give it a shot for the longest time i felt like my therapist basically chatted with me gave me compliments telling me how strong i was etc and just told me what i wanted to hear this made me angry and so many times i would leave our sessions thinking i dont need compliments i need help i could tell i wasnt getting anywhere but everyone i talked to who had been to therapy kept telling me that it takes time and i just needed to be patient i got so frustrated that i was one session away from switching to someone else i worked up my courage a little bit went into the session and said im frustrated with my lack of progress i feel like you are treating me carefully like i am fragile and ready to break at a moments notice telling me im strong makes me feel good temporarily but then i leave and im still in this deep black hole i need you to push me out of my comfort zone i need to know is there a way i can make faster progress stupidly i was afraid this would somehow offend her instead without batting an eye she simply said yes we can delve deeper into your trauma and start getting into the heavy stuff that is the fastest way for you to make progress i wasnt sure if you were ready for the rest of that session and for subsequent sessions she completely changed her whole demeanorapproach and let me tell you it was and continues to be so so shitty its been hard but im in a better place i can feel the sadness slowly lifting and i actually feel like im making progress now im so glad i didnt switch therapists before saying that it almost didnt even occur to me as a thing i should say to everyone out there whether youre in the same boat or not i wish you good luck 3 edit grammar,pre-pandemic

just saw a post on rconfessions about a man who is sexually coercing his wife by manipulating her into thinking that the terms of her consent are being met of course barely anyone points out that he is sexually assaulting her and when i do random reddit idiots respond telling me that he isnt sexually coercing her and that i dont understand what sexual coercion is as if two years of my life werent made a complete and utter nightmare by my own experience with coercion and a police report for sexual assault was never filed our societys views on dating relationships and sexual deviance especially heterosexual mens viewsdont argue with me are so backwards and blatantly incorrect that i feel like its safer to be brutal and ruthless with my boundaries and risk hurting a love interes feelings or be alone completely its just so deeply disturbing how misogynistic selfcentered and oblivious men are in their relationships with women i wish i could feel romantic attraction to women because life would be so much easier and safer,pre-pandemic

hello so first things first i do not have autism but i believe that someone in a discord server i am in is lying about having autism and basically being abused for attention or trying to get pity for some reason i have very little knowledge about severe autism which the person claims to have and i do not want to go and accuse them in case i am wrong ad that would severely hurt them however would i person with severe autism consistently misspell words like word in a consistent manner would the misspellings be caused by theyre pronunciation of the word sorry if this is the wrong place for this or if this causes any negative emotions i think its really messed up if this person is using autism to get people to pity her or whatever,pre-pandemic
i have been court ordered to complete some form of short term inpatient before proceeding with outpatient does anyone know of any rehabs for alcohol that will treat teenagers and are under 30 days i am not against rehab i do believe that there are certain things i need to work on but have been told by multiple medical professionals that iop would be far more beneficial for me at this point unfortunately my probation officer disagreed and the judge just sided with him willing to do the work and continue complying with whatever aftercare options just trying to find a 23 week rehab program considering the court has not specified a timeline and left it up to us we will also be forced to pay out of pocket because insurance has deemed it not medically necessary and will not cover for me to go to inpatient so essentially the shorter the better,post-pandemic

its rant time half of the posts on here are people simply complaining about the negative effects of adhd even if you guys ask for help the top comment is usually something along the lines of im the same way life sucks adhd sucks etc etc even if i try injecting a little positivity it usually gets shot down or ignored ive been told on here that theres absolutely zero benefits to having adhd why are you people so negative you have an abnormality in your brain that will literally never go away it is who you are instead of fighting it and telling yourself what a bad person you are why dont you just accept it and use it to your advantage you cant keep an entry level job maybe thats not what youre cut out for maybe you should look at the things you are good at the things you can hyperfocus on and make a living out of that meds are a godsend and theyll help fill in the gaps where necessary doing well in life is mostly about mindset like i said whether you like it or not your brain is always going to be adhd you can say to yourself that youre bound to this terrible debilitating disorder and live the rest of your life in misery because you think youre not good enough or you can thank god that you arent like everyone else and you actually have a lot of unique traits i cant understand why anyone wants to settle for just a normal life with adhd you can thrive off of a constantly changing environment hyperfocusing on whatever your brain chooses along the way you naturally think outside the box society needs people like us in order to progress can you imagine if there were never different people throughout history i highly doubt we would have any of the innovations we do today personally im okay with having adhd i dont see it as a disorder before you run to the comments to criticize yes i am aware of the structural differences in the brain ive seen the barkley videos etc i still dont see the point in living miserably because i have this terrible disorder i enjoy having varied interests knowing in depth information about random topics ranging from history to cars to movies etc and for the things that i struggle with school mostly there are meds even when im not in school i still use meds to be more productive but my brain is still adhd tldr it doesnt make sense to live your life in misery because you have adhd make the best of it edit ive been thinking about it and ive decided this sub is toxic and i think im gonna leave deuces,pre-pandemic
ten years ago i traveled abroad with a group for a gap year in south america we had a weird and terrible experience when we went to a spa retreat owned by an expat american man 7 of the other girls were molested during a spiritual healing ceremony without anyone saying a word they all were 18 and thats the only reason i can think they didnt speak up i went last and fought the abuser and got out of there then went to my group leader with it and as i told her about it the rest of the group chimed in saying me too me too against our wishes the group leader told the abuser the reason why we decided to leave early and the abuser came to my room at night to try to tell me it was all innocent i was still just a kid but i had to be the face of the group then our own groups leader talked to me about it later in the trip and said it was all a misunderstanding that things were different back in the hippy days and she was raised with that kind of thing and he didnt mean anything by it i went home from the trip afraid of being touched at all by my significant other and it took months for me to recover enough to just be touched flash forward to today i watched a documentary about a man who abused foster kids and at the end the story said the abuser had moved to a tiny island outside guam where there was little oversight i remembered my experience and i realized its possible hes still out there doing exactly the same thing sure enough his tripadvisor is full of recent reviews hes definitely still in business and as i searched i found out a woman went to his establishment and was raped by him two months after our groups visit she traveled back to his country with her husband to sue him and talk to the media reading this really validated my experience because i had been wavering in my mind about the experience all these years but this was a totally separate incident right at the same time we were there so i wrote about the experience in detail in their tripadvisor comments i explained exactly what happened in that public forum i felt i needed to take some sort of action and i think this was an impactful thing to do im worried tripadvisor might take the comment down i got a message back from his wife on my review and it essentially said i must be mistaken it brings me joy to think he and his wife had to revisit this subject yet again and that i might save someone else from going through what i did it feels good to have done it but it hurts me that i cant share it with anyone i feel empowered but also alone edit thank you for the support i have actually been feeling guilty for possibly hurting this guys familys livelihood and started questioning myself so your support is really appreciated im thousands of miles away and relatively anonymous but i still dont feel safe,pre-pandemic
there was a guy i met in this sub a really good guy i followed many of his posts and didnt speak to him till i saw his last post in which he described how he felt and announced how he is gonna take his own life its really disheartening how our own mind plays tricks with us to the point where we will lose all our hope dreams and joy in life how it puts us in a loop where everything seems dull and empty this guy was a legend he tried his best but still unable to find strenght to carry on i believe this is the worst way to go i wish i said something more i wish i knew better now there is nothing anyone can do he left thinking worst of himself feeling worthless after many years of struggle please dont mind if its written poorly i had to get this off my chest thanks,pre-pandemic

does this happen to anyone else i actually think this sub is a great tool for cathartic sharing among people with anxiety and i know i could derive some benefit in allowing myself to post more but theres some silly irony in me thinking well what if this gets ignored what if people think this is dumb or invalid even right now as i type this i think oh yeah this is so witty and meta this will definitely get me to the top of the sub which is so in line with every obsession i have about being special being great being loved etc and my inability to just do or enjoy the small things for what they are without some greater sense of meaning edit ha this blew up how poetic the joy or validation i feel from the upvotes doesnt match the negativity i would have felt if it went unnoticed which is good to know you all are wonderful and this is a great community ive come a long way with my anxiety and im working on a project to help and give back to those struggling and those who have helped me so i hope to see you all here again,pre-pandemic
i see so many post about such amazing people here being in relationships with the human equivalents of wet breadcrumbs and i just cant help but be angry i feel angry because before i met my current boyfriend i let people step all over me push my boundaries and treat me like absolute garbage just because i felt like anything is a better choice than being alone and that is more than what i deserved my current boyfriend is the sweetest boy ive ever met he treats me like im actually special ngl ive tried to break up with him just because i feel like i do not deserve such pure love i get really mad at him sometimes because he is being kind of pressuring me to eat and take my supplements ect but i know he only does this cause he is worried and wants a future with me i can see the love in his eyes he taught me what love should look like and he inspires me to give some compassion to myself because if such a good guy can love me im probably not that horrible i really wish that all you guys can find love one day,post-pandemic
i met a girl who is a doctor she is in her 30s like me it seems to me that she could be a hypochondriac or frequently exhibits signs of being preoccupied with her health and body sometimes she tells me in confidence that she has such a symptom or pain and that she thinks it might be x problem other times she says that since she has a symptom she is going to consult with her medical colleagues as we are getting to know each other is it good for me to ask if she has been told she is a hypochondriac i guess its best not to use any labels is it good for me to tell her that everything will be fine or should i just listen what phrases can i use to encourage her that her health is fine,post-pandemic
im 20 and was diagnosed bp2 by a free therapist at my university when i was 18 i have health insurance through my parents but they dont believe in mental health so i could never seek real treatment even hippa doesnt apply because my bills and stuff would still have been sent to their house and there was no way for me to change the billing address so ive been cycling pretty much non stop for 2 years i gave up hope of ever being able to be on medication or receive real therapy this whole mess has caused me to be so isolated my whole first two years of college receive horrible grades etc a few months ago during a horrible depressive episode i emailed my schools student support services and asked if there was anyway i would qualify for a grant for the student health care its 2000 a year ontop of a 36000 tuition and im paying for my own school so there was no way i could afford it i explained i had been diagnosed bipolar and was barely coping i didnt hear back from them for months so i kinda forgot about it well today i got an email they gave me a full grant to cover it for the rest of my time in school so i have free health insurance now allowing me to get a real therapist psychiatrist and even go to a normal doctor for free i cant even express how crazy this is i literally cried with joy when i got the email i was sooo so hopeless and giving up on all my dreams and now i have a way to get healthy again and i have no one to tell in real life,pre-pandemic
i thought some of these points could be helpful please reflect 1 dont believe everything you feel your immediate feelings are a reflection of past fear centered programming and often dont take into consideration an updated perception over an experience 2 your anxiety symptoms are messages and signals messages in the form of overwhelm a chronically stressful life chapter suppressed negative emotions signals because of a need to protect from unfamiliar upcoming situations or interpretations of threat 3 protect from less enjoy your progress more its best to take the approach of looking to protect the body from illness less and focus on living out the progress coming from your change work more this shift takes time to embed deeply into mind and body so be patient slow down in the face of fear and youll tap into the kind of inner wisdom you could never feel into while being in your old frantic state much love dennis,post-pandemic

recently i told my boyfriend i wanted a little bit of space like a few hours in a day when were not physically together because he was being quite clingy and he ended up distancing himself a lot even made new plans during the weekend so we are not currently together even though i told him i never meant that as in lets cancel our plans and each be on our own this weekend so ive barely been in touch with him in the past 2 days im not used to this and frankly never asked for it in this sense and earlier he just told me he didnt feel safe in a relationship with me because i struggled to feel like anything he did was enough i admitted i struggled to feel satisfied im just always empty or feel detached from myself no matter what he also deleted one message that i saw in my notifications where he said something along the lines of im thinking more soberly right now and came to realise that you actually dont contribute anything to the relationship i feel like an enormous burden because i genuinely dont know what im doing so wrong apart from struggling to feel satisfied and always wanting more and im perceiving that hes going to abandon me again after like a month and a half and im spiralling i dont know what to do i genuinely just want to go right here and now abandonment hurts far too much i cant go through this again,post-pandemic

a year ago i discovered im audhd so now theres a lot of aha moments poping up lately this is my latest aha moment and i think its a huge piece of the puzzle for me trying to understand my experience in my younger years from 1925 ish i hung out with a group of people we mostly partied together 47 guys early on they gave me the nickname fishy but i could never understand why the idea that they probably meant that i was suspicious came tonight i was always drifting around in my own world but i masked hard so theres unfortunately not a lot that i remember about the interactions in itself what i do remember though is that i didnt tell them that i had fishes at home i didnt smell fish i didnt tell them that i ate fish i didnt tell them that i liked fishing or anything other that had to do with the species fish what could be some reasons for an autistic adhder being called fishy in a social group setting,post-pandemic

how do you deal with your loved ones being friends with people that have hurt you its hard for me to understand why they would want a relationship with someone who has disrespected or degraded me in any way especially when ive told them about it i know i cant expect people to not have different relationships with orhers but it always hurts especially when they just pretend like this person hasnt hurt me in so many ways in the past i dont know is it too much to ask for to have friends who arent friends with people who dont like or respect me,post-pandemic

i just want to go to the mountains and scream my lungs out i will never make the mistake of stopping my meds midway through treatment please dont stop taking your meds at your own will or just because a loved one told you to try your hardest to stay on meds and listen to what your psychiatrist says my parents ridiculed me the whole time i was home for the holidays saying that im an addict and that i have nothing wrong with all the while saying that im just an ungrateful kid who is wasting money and that my therapist is just exacerbating my mental health issues sure enough i let this shit get to me and never tried to get a followup appointment and within 4 days of my meds getting over i could feel myself deteriorate the suicidal thoughts came back with so many other things my meds were holding back from me when i told this to my parents they suggested i should just focus on my work sleep on time and drink water i tried to get an appointment but it took 3 weeks for them to set me up with my doctor i feel so pathetic for actually listening to the same people who actively ruined my mental health and selfesteem the same people who ridiculed me when i had depression in 2021 to them it doesnt matter i feel alone living in a new city heck i have an aunt im very close with but im not allowed to see her because im supposed to spend my time doing my online courses i told my dad about me finally getting an appointment and he just called me to force me to take homeopathic meds along with my psych meds is he a doctor no i just hope i dont have to start from square one and try out new meds again i really cant afford to have negative side effects ive already spent this whole week struggling to be even a little productive with my work and household chores man,post-pandemic

idk how to feel rn lol i had my first telehealth psychiatrist appointment an hour ago and it felt so fake and like surface level like she seemed tired and uninterested in my problems i was trying to tell her that ive had social anxiety my entire life and a severe driving phobia that i am trying to work on and i wanted to see maybe if im on the autism spectrum because i feel like theres something else wrong with me also she just gravitated towards the driving thing and kept asking what do i think im missing out on by not driving like im 28 i missed out on everything obviously i know that i know thats a lot to get through and its hard to trauma dump in 60 minutes but it seemed like she just asked me such juvenile questions she went through mindfulness and grounding and positive affirmations like friend if i look at myself in the mirror im not going to say anything positive and told me to go on walks and get a rock to hold and ground myself i cant go outside if my neighbors are out and certainly cant walk down the road without thinking im going to be kidnapped lol she also said to write a letter to myself i have written so many letters to myself and they always turn out to be very mean not positive she also kept smiling at me weird and it felt like she was laughing at me why is it so hard to do this i just want to find someone that i can basically trauma dump on and have them ask questions about what im telling them not ask me about my goals why cant texting therapy exist why cant they send me a questionnaire and let me think about and fill out each answer in detail why is this so fucking annoying,post-pandemic
ive been mentally exhausted for years which is creating physical exhaustion im scared im showing signs of having a breakdown i dont know what to do or who to talk to about this background diagnosed with ptsd in 2019 at age 30 after a childhood with emotional abuse undiagnosed adhd sexual trauma and back to back emotionally and physically abusive romantic relationships in my 20s my ptsd diagnosis was the first time i started to feel i was on the road to a calmer life with emdr consistent therapy and mindfulness practices then a few months later in 2020 i found myself dealing with the same calamity everyone else did and in that isolating and confusing space ended up in yet another abusive relationship this one somehow worse than the others in 2022 i was finally able to leave move and had to readjust to a new city career the grief over both the relationship and other losses was intense i also went through medical procedures throughout last year that took a lot of my time and energy and have left me feeling further depleted throughout all of this on the surface i have generally managed to maintain financial stability and some level of career success i have good friends a therapist and loving family i am in decent physical shape on the inside however i am constantly overwhelmed basic tasks take a ton out of me i am incredibly disorganized and lose track of parking tickets auto registration and other basic adult responsibilities the more i succeed at work the more my personal care completely slides out the window i havent worked out consistently in years dating has been difficult its as if i only have the energy to pay attention to one facet of my life as an adult i am physically exhausted and have repeatedly had colds and viruses i swear my face has aged dramatically the last two years all of this feels unsustainable i fantasize about taking some sort of work leave and going into an in patient treatment facility or quitting my job moving again and working part time at some sort of low responsibility gig until i feel more rested my financial situation would prob not allow for the latter i guess i am venting but also looking for advice on whether this sounds like i am setting myself up for a breakdown whether i should genuinely explore an inpatient option or if theres other treatments to explore neurofeedback therapy cereset stellate ganglion block are all on my radar,post-pandemic

long time lurker recently becoming active i love each and every one of you to pieces this sub and the love from all of you posting and responding to each other has kept me on track to recovery better than my therapist im still newly in recovery i think but this has been my longest healthiest bout 36 days now compared to 35 day binge cycles my whole life i wanted to share what i think of as my secret to success just in case it works on a single other person the goal is to focus compmetely on becoming my alter ego skinny cool girl scg is basically my imaginary role model who is me from the future and is essentially me except she is super hot and climbs mountains and is friendly and adventurous and has lots of tattoos and dogs and is buddhist i wasnt doing so well on the hot part body dysmorphia or not im still not sure but damn it i want to be scg so i decided tostart something else scg does besides look good to start rock climbing to get my first tattoo to start hiking to try a kickboxing class to go out with friends i just went skinny dipping no pun intended my next step is to go dancing for the first time im planning a backpacking trip for next summer im going to class so i can get the degree scg has scg doesnt like everything she tries but she tries anything and she doesnt wait for other people to suggest things she thinks of things she wants to do and seeks them out basically i dont want to do those things but scg does and i want to be scg so i go and i have had a great time and maybe im getting a little bit closer to being her what im saying is who will you be when you are your skinny cool girl will you go skydiving will you sing karaoke will you dress in bright bold clothes will you flirt with someone will you eat balanced meals or apply for a better job will you perform or display your art will you go to bed on time what leap will you take someday in order to become her when will she do insert activity here for the first time can you make it happen now take one of the things future scg has about her that you dont have that isnt weight related and go do it in the body you own and operate at this moment the brain your soul who you want to be does not change after you lose weight go be her you have to become her still weight is only a small part of the equation youll catch up to scg dont waste time while you think youre fat not being cool girl or else youll lose the weight and find out that scg doesnt exist yet,pre-pandemic

well its complicated its hard for me to even talk about it with my psychologist my voice breaks and i just cant talk even when i want to i will try to summarize all my trauma i express myself best by writing and reading maybe i can read it for my psychologist sorry if there are grammatical errors english is not my language when i was 7 years old i had a pretty normal life or that was until my sister suffered a brain hemorrhage and went to the hospital with my parents while they sent me to different families of friends and acquaintances to take care of me that wasnt really a problem i was just a little scared because everyone was reminding me that my sister would probably die although i still always felt good i was made to feel welcome by the 3 families i was with and even though my parents didnt see me to take care of my sister it didnt affect me much but everything changed when they took me to my aunt my aunt had an argument with my mother before but i still had a good relationship with my father so they didnt hesitate to leave me in their care obviously they asked in advance it wasnt obligatory my aunt on the first day just put me out on the street with the equivalent of 2 dollars and told me to get by the first day was glory i thought that not having adults was the best but the second day i had no food or money i went back to my aunts house who beat me up and left me on the street again so yes that was my situation then i remind you that i was still a 7yearold girly i taught other homeless people how to collect cardboard to get money i collected cardboard and with that i was able to earn some money and money equaled food i met a boy a little older than me in the same situation so i followed him and we became friends i called him big brother i dont even remember his real name we played when we got the food that used to be cookies once we played knocking on the doors of houses and running away to see how people react and laugh only he knocked on the wrong door and a guy came out with a gun and started shooting we ran and went together until a pam sounded and he fell silent and i just ran like a coward and left him behind i never saw him again and to this day i wonder if it was the right thing to run after all i left him alone maybe dying and this was the beginning of my traumas i was alone again on the streets they were one of the most dangerous in the city where it was known that there were criminals being a child i had to keep my guard so i didnt sleep eventually i managed to get together with a group of homeless people i think drug addicts that i was fortunate enough to meet they didnt take advantage of me in fact they were very nice to me they started playing the games i played with me the problem was that we were still on the street and had to avoid other more violent groups i remember once we came to rest at a place and a group told us to leave their territory one of our own one of the bravest said no but one of the other group also came out opened his knife and slashed him in the neck he tried to keep up but there was a lot of bleeding and he fell to the ground i remember they covered my eyes and carried me running but i also remember when i made a pet bottle and it broke we had a funeral and they did a great job following the game eventually i got used to it and one day my aunt had the audacity to pick me up but not to take care of me obviously but because i had started school and it would be very suspicious if i didnt go so he would take me from the street at a certain time to his house set a timer and i had to be ready to walk to school and then he would go back to his house leave my things and drop me off on the street again the kids started making fun of me for my bad smell and appearance in general also how i fell asleep in class it broke my heart before i was loved by those who claimed to be my friends now they just laughed at me the jokes escalated and there was quickly physical abuse after school there were times when i would limp in i wasnt happy with my aunt or at school the street was the only refuge i decided once not to go with my aunt at the allotted time so i wouldnt go to school in the afternoon my parents found me took time to look for me and scolded me for running away from my aunts house i tried to explain that she wasnt good to me but they just shut me up they thought they were excuses because i didnt want to be in school they sent me to my aunts house and left i hadnt seen them in 4 months and they only came to scold me at my aunts house it didnt go any better she had an electrical cord with which she hit me it hit my back so much that it opened it up i switched to putting my chest on but it was worse and gave me a terrible cut on my chest for a mental picture i still have a visible scar after 10 years he kept beating me for a long time until he got tired and threw me out into the street i was able to crawl and eventually stand up but everything hurt and i couldnt keep it up for long luckily i made it to my group i didnt go to school the next day because the injuries prevented me from moving and my aunt didnt want to have a child abuse warning the only ones who took care of me were them but i really dont know what hurt me more the wounds for my aunt or that feeling of betrayal from my own parents and thats how my 6 months in the worst hell went eventually i went back to my house but it wasnt the same anymore my sister came out alive and without any sequelae other than a slight lost memory and the loss of her great math skills but my parents put all their concentration on her and i became invisible to their eyes my schoolmates were still bastards i remember when i mentioned that i wanted to be a veterinarian they took a cat and cut it open by the belly and then they threw it at me agonizing saying that it will repair it i had to learn how to fight but i only ended up like this alone i only had 3 friends i dont know if i could call them that because they were only with me to defend them from the bullies thats how it happened until i was 10 then they took me to another school and i suffered a mental breakdown i had learned that i had to fight against everyone because no one was going to help me and that everyone was mostly hostile and didnt care and when i walked into that classroom i was given a different reality where they were good for the sake of being good i didnt understand it i had to fight a lot to readapt to this new world where everyone didnt call me weird but told me that i was very nice to take care of them but even so all that never went away its been 10 years sometimes i have nightmares i have a lot of intrusive thoughts panic attacks and flashbacks that keep haunting me despite everything being okay i was recently diagnosed with complex ptsd and im relieved to finally know whats wrong with me thats why im grateful that theres this kind of community its pretty good that people get together to get through this thats why i thank those who read im probably going to read this too to express everything to my psychologist,post-pandemic
hi all i am bp1 and we have ruled out bpd i also have adhd anxiety and ptsd i had been stable on latuda zoloft and buspar for 3 years this last september i was dealing with a really stressful event when i subtly started shifting into an episode i was depressed for 45 days and then slipped into hypomania the wintertime darkness i live in alaska so extreme dark crept in around the same time and i associated the dark with the depression from my episode my depressive episode continued and i foolishly assumed it was seasonal depression and asked to up my zoloft this wound up inducing a horrible mixed episode and i began rapid cycling and would be hypomanic from wake up till about 35pm when i would shift into extreme depression until i fell asleep and the cycle repeated itself and continues to do so i now am traumatized by the dark coming and get anticipatory anxiety panic attacks about the depressive episode coming and i spend my entire morning and afternoon stressed i am now lowering my zoloft and we added lamictal to the mix and i am waiting anxiously for it to kick in but that will be a month or better as we titrate up i also am starting emdr therapy to process the darkness trigger that this mess created has anyone experienced anything similar and overcame it i am absolutely desperate for relief and am in therapy but no amount of mindlessness or meditation is helping the evening depressive episodes thanks,post-pandemic
one year ago i was up well past midnight on adderall smoking weed and crying because my wife was not coming home it suddenly hit me that it was time to make a radical change in my life at 7 oclock in the morning i reached out to my family and told them that i was struggling with substance abuse i had been smoking weed daily for over 20 years and at various times had used opiates benzos amphetamines and xtc i went to an iop class and then to an mrt class all the while going to weekly therapy sessions in spite of my positive transformation my wife did not come back but i did get custody of our children when the divorce was finalized there are times when i think about using and let me tell you ive had plenty of opportunities the bottom line is i like who i am without the drugs i miss my wife and the relationship that we once had but perhaps i needed to lose her in order to find myself so my story is a little bittersweet and that is life i am still learning to accept the things i cannot change,pre-pandemic

what do you actually do when your boundaries are being steam rolled by unreasonable people you live with i have been having an unreasonable time with a roommate who sort of manages the property we got into it on some app and the first thing i said was i didnt want to discuss anything over the phone it instantly turned into like written essays about my deficiencies which i assure you are ridiculous i stated my points repeated i didnt want a long distance discussion told them they were being blocked the next day i am having locks put on my doors by the landlord for related bs the same person comes knocking and when i finally open the door face to face i am being aggressively lectured about my inappropriate reactions i gotta say i dont often get a lot of emotion from text messages and i find it super weird when i just say the things and people get all kinds of threatened feelings anyway i had somewhere to be and calmly said i wasnt interested in what he was putting forward i put up with as much as i could before getting to a scary place and the guy physically tried to hold the door to my personal space open before saying he was calling the police on me like wtf are we 8 how could anyone deal with this without it taking a toll on their health how could somebody actually chase around and harrass an individual they know nothing about save that they have severe ptsd like how can you actually back someone into a corner and expect things to get better note i dont think it really matters what happened in the lead up to this im not hiding it i just think its irrelevant in short it was me slowly losing sleep from their noise in common areas above my room all night for days on end until i had no sleep and then i was not functioning so well and having someone send me pictures of a slightly dirty glass stove top that is still too hot to clean because it was just used pushed me over the edge also they sold my furniture online and didnt tell me until they needed help moving it,post-pandemic

hello here we go again i didnt have a good childhood theres a reason im here among the biggest traumas that dealt with it is closely related to school i was bullied physically verbally psychologically and socially and it took its toll on me the worst thing is that they didnt even have a reason to do it they just wanted to mess with someone and thats why they almost beat me to death it made me very tense and very anxious about everything but the worst part is that i need to keep going to a school now school is not bad my classmates really support and take care of me but i just spend most of the classes dissociated from reality i need to focus on getting things done and the class but it just gets hard when it comes to getting the job done these months i really have to make an effort if i want to ensure a good future any recommendations,post-pandemic
hi all this is a bit of a strange one but i need some advice on whether or not it would be a good idea to set up a dedicated service for people who struggle with health anxiety im currently doing a course on cbt and i want to help empower people who struggle with ha to take back control of their lives by giving them the tools to do so this would be done using a dedicated website where people can seek important resources on health anxiety and panic as well as one to one sessions where i work collaboratively with individuals to set small achievable goals to help them get back on track using cbt and exposure response prevention to help people break out of these awful cycles i need objective opinions because my parents think it would be a bad idea i myself have suffered with health anxiety see my post history and i know how much it can affect ones life thankyou,post-pandemic

it baffles me how so many people are surprised that they spend most of their time alone we live in a game the majority of people think is real life go to 9 to 5 job complete tasks get a pay cheque spend a pay cheque on survival rinse and repeat if we all are living to survive why the fuck would any of us want to hang out with anyone of that same mindset and lifestyle do you have anything of value to offer anyone in a friendship or relationship for that matter in your current state of mind we should try changing ourselves before bringing others into our inner circle just a thought,post-pandemic

so basically i tried to do it a couple of months ago had everything prepared was ready to just end it all until all of a sudden i got way too scared and decided to call it off my mom saw the letter that i was supposed to leave and went behind my back showed it off to her friends and some family members then talked to me about it i became some sort of beacon of attention which i hated people telling me that itll get better or saying if it was true sometimes i kinda wished i wasnt such a pussy and ended it right then and there couldve saved myself from embarrasment,pre-pandemic
ive been working with a psychologist weekly to deal with my health anxiety currently i am working hard to resist compulsions that fuel my ocd and health anxiety i am learning that as long as i give into these compulsions the ocd and health anxiety stays alive i find that as i am trying to resist giving in my brain still thinks theres a health emergency living with this risky feeling and not giving in is one of the hardest things ive done in my life i wanted to share in case anyone could relate or is going through something similar,post-pandemic

i wish their was a cure for bpd this is exhausting everything is a trigger for me like i got left on read by one of my friends i had a meltdown over that and was crying until i threw up i also have bipolar the mania mixed with it doesnt go well my dad is the reason why i deal with this bc he is a high narcissist and a drug addict and i dealt with the trauma until i was 13 i didnt feel any symptoms of bad mental health or bpd until i was about 14 like my sister goes through hell bc of me during an episode i end up yelling at her then we have a long conversation about it we arent related but we act like sisters and are always together me n her have been friends since july 2022 and after the argument we have i just sob saying why cant i be normal my 18yr old brother can hear me in my room during that point and gets worried about me and i dont think my mom gets it i try to talk to her but she is just like thats something you need to talk about to your therapist but i dont see her until monday sometimes i wanna talk to someone when its needed and not wait with all the emotions this shit just hurts and it feels like i have no one to talk to bc i cant always put all the pressure on my sister when shes already going through things her self i literally have no one to talk to during the day or night all i have is just myself and the anger outbursts are so fucking bad even trying to sleep it off doesnt even work i have to wait a whole day or sometimes a week for it to pass sometimes suicide feels like the only answer,post-pandemic
hi all ill try to keep this short but can elaborate on anything if needed so last year i started my daughter in therapy to help with anxiety issues the psychologist working with her and identified that she had autistic traits and it may be worth looking into initial screening flagged med to high indications of autism and now me and my wife are at the point of discussing whether to seek proper diagnosis for my wife who was diagnosed late in life with adhd is advocating hard for diagnosis on the basis of how much her own diagnosis helped her understand herself she believes a diagnosis if confirmed will help our daughter understand who she is and get her the right help to deal with it for myself not diagnosed but probably autistic my childs mind and personality is almost a carbon copy of mine im concerned a diagnosis will set her up for a life of selfimposed limitations discrimination people being dismissive of her and her behaviour because of a diagnosis etc i dont want my daughter to grow up thinking she cant achieve her goals because of this diagnosis ive suggested we can get our daughter the same professional help without the official diagnosis but my wife is not convinced for both me and my wife our reasonings are deeply personal and our viewpoints are strong for those of you out there who were diagnosed later in life especially women have a child who is diagnosed or not or otherwise may be able to empathise with the above id love to understand how a diagnosis for better or worse will affect my daughters life any advice or insight is appreciated,post-pandemic

just a tip that has been the biggest breakthrough ive had in the past two decades of managing my adhd smelling salts like what weightlifters use i take a quick whiff when 1 seems like my medication isnt getting me out of bed starting my day 2 i feel like my medication is tapering off prematurely 3 im in the zone getting shit done but i can feel like its about to come to an abrupt end bc i want to sit down or take 5 4 been waiting around for something to start and start to feel a stark downtick in interest level i compete in a sport where theres 1540min downtime between 1030 seconds of action 5 ive knocked out a great 34hrs of work on one task and have to change to another task and my brain starts fogging definitely consult with your care provider i dont know what the long term effects are im sure this could develop into an unhealthy habit of some sort etc etc but realistically i use it 34 times a week and it really saves me from some days that would normally end prematurely or im about to spiraling into vegetation mode,post-pandemic

its been a while but ive continued drinking i cut down a lot but got lost in it again im doing okay and have slowly been decreasing my intake again the world just feels so miserable without being intoxicated im stuck at my job and hate it but cant afford to leave and i am dealing with i guess some sort of ptsd from past traumas that want me to stay not sober but i want to be and that determination is whats keeping me going even on my relapses i feel grosser than i did and dont want to continue on ive gotten better at reducing my substance intake entirely wether thats alcohol nicotine or marijuana ive started to really cut back on all three i think this is still progress despite my relapses i dont get black out i never have but i do get close on my relapses ive learned to not let it get that far and even though im not sober and not clean i find some sort of comfort in knowing im taking in less,post-pandemic
so ive never heard of anyone having this issue i tried googling it years ago i wonder if anyone else has this i have extreme anxiety related to walking and also shoes its been going on for about 15 years i feel uncomfortable walking and have to have specific shoes i feel especially uncomfortable walking if i feel someones paying attention like cars driving by or people around me i almost feel like my other leg is shorter or something the thing is when i have specific shoes on i feel relaxed examples of these shoes are flat heeled boots i am very specific about shoes cant wear sneakers because i will feel wobbly when walking i have sometimes found shoes like ballerina flats and have gotten slowly used to a specific pair but as soon as winter comes i forget how to walk in those shoes and just wanna stick to my boots as long as possible long dresses make me comfortable too this sounds ridiculous,post-pandemic

throwaway account because people know my real username from the ages of 1521 25f i was in an abusive relationship mentally verbally and sometimes physically i was never shown any sort of affection from my ex and was always made to feel like i was a burden and that i dont matter i was kept from my family wasnt allowed any friends and he even controlled my money and took any income i made and spent it on various project cars i finally left at 21 and met my now husband who is the most amazing person i have ever met he is kind he treats me with respect he truly loves me etc my friends even called him a robot when we met because he seemed to have no flaws at all hes still pretty perfect to me even with his minor flaws anyway i was diagnosed with ptsd shortly after leaving my exhusband and i am still in therapy trying to deal with my issues from that relationship today is valentines day holidays are typically a big trigger for me but especially valentines day and my birthday at 4am my husband woke me up to take him to the hospital he ended up being diagnosed with two kidney stones and had to get a ton of narcotics which made him really sick we ended up getting home around noon and immediately went to sleep i went to the store around 4 once he woke up and i got him some migraine medicine some of his favorite snacks and a valentines day card i brought them home and he cried saying he doesnt deserve me and how much he appreciates me this is our first valentines day as a married couple and im sad that this is how its going i know it isnt his fault and he does feel really bad that we couldnt do anything today and he didnt get me anything or do anything for me but i am feeling very sad and disappointed i feel shame for my feelings because he literally cannot help that he got kidney stones that are making him sick i know he is nothing like my ex and has never been remotely rude to me let alone made me feel like shit on purpose for fun but im sitting on the couch typing this while hes in bed and i am so overwhelmed with sadness i keep trying to hold back tears i really just want to be normal i dont want to be fucked up and i dont want the people around me to feel bad for things out of their control because of my ptsd and i know thats why hes been so apologetic he knows the exact details of my past relationship that caused my ptsd and he knows my triggers big and small out of all days i wish my brain would just shut the fuck up at least today,post-pandemic
okay so let me start by saying i am 24m and have been using crack primarily as well as various other drugs i started using in excess in the summer of the year i had turned 18 for some reason i figured i was immune to the ill effects from drugs at this point i mean what could possibly go wrong with inhaling gram lines of blow dozens of times for days at a time aka binging i remember being almost fascinated the first time i experienced the tactile hallucinations feeling spiders crawling on my arm after also not sleeping for around a week then looking and actually seeing them instead of the previous hallucinations in the peripheral vision clearly wasnt sure exactly how off the wall that was at the time but to continue after id say about 1 12 2 years of snorting i graduated to the pipe which unsurprisingly brought me to a different type of nightmare i will never forget glossing over details of it i spent nearly 8 months in drug induced psychosis without even knowing what psychosis was ngl i find that a bit funny now cause like what the fuck lmao 8 months ended in me trying to kill myself routinely all leading to one very sincere attempt that evidently didnt work at this time im 21 and remember being in the psych ward and leveling with myself cause when you really ask yourself whats more likely whole worlds out to get ya or maybe just maybe ur smoking too much fuckin crack anyways from 2124 ive spent just over a year off the rocks not consecutively and why i write this is because i have gradually cut down immensely on my usage although theres many compounding aspects to this which hopefully doesnt make it too convoluted ive admittedly been wasting potential and time shocker which leads me to believe many of my friends from over the years understandably wish not to associate with a crackhead regardless of a fond history before they were a crackhead now this is where drawing the line becomes an issue for me because i know that i do have friends family that want me back the real me not some fuckin crack goblin loser leading me to believe that some have come together to trip me the fuck out every time they can get a chance while im under the influence theres a ridiculous variety of ways to approach it drones malware voice changers ai scripts which raises the question who actually would invest that much into it like i said im aware what im saying is out there although theres some people out there who are lonely and get quite bored only extent of themselves essentially being on the internet i can still notice these type of things once the effects of the drug wear off though which is why im becoming skeptical basically chillin everythings normal everyones normal take the hit got multiple people trying to talk to me simultaneously as well as talking incomprehensibly asking me to do multiple tasks at a time i get mad overwhelmed bug out no bueno crack wears off but people are still acting weird ive been buying into the whole tweaker character in excess in order to see the results which is another reason im genuinely unsure of the objective truth here x200b if you have any insight or comments or questions run it up thanks big city spider,post-pandemic

tw mentions of abuse drugs suicide sa and traumatic events i was diagnosed with ptsd when i was 14 my healing journey has been difficult to say the least but the nightmares as of late have been an extreme struggle for me im so sick of having these nightmares all the time i have consistently had nightmares about someone breaking into my home and harming me or my family for years as i type i just woke up maybe 20 minutes ago from yet another one of these bad dreams i woke up in a fullblown panic again im so sick of these nightmares to the point where im afraid to fall asleep sometimes because of them i have a lot of trauma to give the short version i was a victim of longterm childhood abuse both physical and mental from my grandparents one of which is a severe addict and the other is extremely physically violent and quick to fullblown rage mental and financial abuse from my mother sexual assault and grooming as a child and teen and sa again as an adult and ive had my fair share of traumatic events occur in my life the only person who ever attempted to protect me or advocate for me as a child committed suicide and passed away when i was 10 my house burned down when i was a teen my grandfather nearly died and i was homeless for a while i was homeless 3 different times as a child and young teen due to circumstances comoletely beyond my control my mom accidentally odd while i was alone with her and a child i was babysitting and i had to save her life only to have her use and abuse me mentally and financially for years after this i was present during a shooting at my high school my old job was robbed and me and my coworker were held at gunpoint this doesnt even begin to scratch the surface of it all needless to say ive been through my fair share of chaos and pain it has not been an easy life and i struggle every day trying to heal the parts of me that have been broken for many years now i have struggled with nightmares about my traumas but these particular ones started just a couple years ago and happen very frequently its always at night always set in whatever home i am living in at the time always perpetrated by a man in dark clothing specifically often the aggressor in the nightmares threatens my family if i dont do what they want or straight up just suddenly accosts me in my home details from things i have experienced recently tend to bleed in to these nightmares for example i went out a couple days ago to see wonka and there is a scene where they use the sewer system to get around the town and pop in and out of manholes so of course in my nightmare there is a manhole in my house for some reason and the aggressor comes out of it and attacks me violently i dont know why i have this theme so consistently in my nightmares but im so sick of it i barely sleep anymore because of the bad dreams sleeping has become a point of anxiety for me due to these bad dreams i wish they would stop i rarely ever get more than a few hours of sleep now once in a while ill get lucky and sleep through a full night but more often than not i toss and turn im up and down i struggle to fall asleep struggle to stay asleep and wake up in a panic more often than id like to admit im so tired all of the time i know there probably isnt much i can do for myself on this front outside of going back to therapy and continuing to try to heal myself and move on from the past sometimes i feel so alone in this and feel like ive failed myself by not being able to fully let go and move on from the past im planning on returning to therapy im at a point right now where i cannot afford it and until my situation changes i am doing the best i can on my own does anyone else experience constant nightmares is there anything youve done outside of therapy that has helped you with it ill take any advice i can get if you read all this thanks for listening to my rant it feels good to get it off my chest and put my thoughts and feelings somewhere if anyone has any suggestions for dealing with nightmares and sleeping through the night i will gladly take them but otherwise i just appreciate you taking the time to read and hear me,post-pandemic

ive been seeing a lot of this lately does this sound like ptsd to you i think someone i know has ptsd how can i be sure i experienced something bad do i have ptsd please ask a mental health professional these questions this community cannot diagnose you and frankly its disrespectful to ask you wouldnt ask a cancer patient if they think you have cancer youd ask a doctor the same goes for any other medical issue if you think you have it ask a professional dont selfdiagnose dont ask people who are already fighting it to diagnose you we can help on the back end with coping suggestions and techniques but we cannot help diagnose you and it would be irresponsible to try,pre-pandemic
i can identify my bpd behaviour about 70 of the time when im in a good place i still have all the thoughts and do crazy shit around my favourite person but i have the ability to moderate it a bit when im okay i can describe my thoughts and feelings which are not normal of course when i have a bad day or episode i cant but i can look back and think thats where you went wrong sometimes its good but when you are so self aware that you know you are acting like a crazy person but do so anyway it kills me inside then theres the feelings of shame of knowing i did something i shouldnt have done of knowing i acted out hurt someone yet again the clarity i have being able to identify the fine line between me and bpd hurts me inside because its like watching a bomb go off knowing the bomb is going off and standing next to it not able to stop the detonation,pre-pandemic

something that has been happening to me since i was a kid before i even got diagnosed i am also autistic so not sure if thats got anything to do with it i get extreme paranoia specifically imagining demonichorrific creatures and figures in my house behind my doors poking their heads out at me to the point that i will lock myself in a room and cant bring myself to open the doors to even go to the toilet its not hallucinations ive never seen these creatures but my head is very imaginative and its like an extremely realistic what if scenario where images of these creatures being behind my doors pop up in my head is it just an extension of the bpd paranoia or something else considering its been happening since i was young,post-pandemic
im always on this constant battle that i throw a small art gallery of my work with friends and family some huge party and then make a plan to sell my stuff and pay off my debt and finally happy to end things accepting that this is the end of the line for me been fighting for every reason to keep going but only thing that makes me happy is jumping off a parking deck i day dream about it constantly like its my goal i just dont want the grief to hurt anyone i just want to be free i wish it was easy to let go been telling myself for years suicide is never the answer life has everything to live for but why does it feel disappearing into the void would be a permanant solution to a permanant problem,post-pandemic
so last month i was able to take my prescribed 40mg in a matter of 2 hours and only feel effects for 4 hours i had to take a week long break due to dr mixups and delays with my prescription i slept for 15 hours a day and eating constantly because i felt insatiable nothing made me feel like i ate anything i week was utter shit now i am at the same point i was last month where my medication is only lasting 4 hours and 40mg feels like 20mg used to be but with a shorter duration i am crashing way too soon in the day around lunch time for most people i felt amazing and started turning my life around when i started treatment again after that prescription mixup 3 weeks ago i also only needed 30mg to get the desired effects for the day i know what im experiencing is a tolerance related issue and not anything ph related because i know what to do in regards to that i am dreading taking a break my days are totally shit when im off my medication i have no energy no motivation and no interest in things when i am not on my meds i was always like this even before i started treatment as well as when i was off it during that week break what do you guys think i should do about this take a day off every week if able to slow the tolerance increase and immediately take a day off and see how that changes things before taking a longer break or immediately take a few days to a week break and return to 1 day break every week and just do this every time my tolerance does this again i know people stay on the same dose for years without increasing their dose but personally that isnt working for me i have been on adderall for 3 months now and this has happened more often then coincidence edit formatting and wording fixed for readability update 1216 i took a day off and took a normal dose of dxm to help with tolerance a noticeable improvement and something i plan on doing maybe once a week in addition to my magnesium at night to help keep my tolerance down,pre-pandemic

like it almost feels you are the predator in a way since you keep your eyes on people and their movements my traumatic experiences have caused me to become very hyper aware and vigilant my eyes follow and observe people like a hawk so i stay safe and avoid such people who i feel will hurt me againwhich in my case translates to everyone but the thing is i believe everyone is a threat so my eyes follow and watch everybody through my peripheral vision beyond my control as if my subconscious is taking over and shutting down what i can control in the present time the thing is having this issue is nearly destroying my life i will literally stare everybody down until they are out of my eyesight lol i have caused hostility frustration and creeped out people but its like my animal brain doesnt care or listen to me or their responses its incredibly difficult if not impossible to be in a classroom it making me really want to drop out because i am more focused on the people around me than the teacherboard people notice this and i make them incredibly nervous because of it i cant speak or relax in group setting since my eyes will dart around scanning the environment as if i am still in danger i am only completely at peace when i am completely alone i have tried therapy and some medications but it hasnt helped much not to mention im always encountering negative social experiences which just amplifies the problem even more anyone else have something similar,pre-pandemic

so when my anxiety is bad but not the worse my anxiety manifests in gerd symptoms like burping not feeling full bubble feeling in my stomach and the heartburn it really sucks and effects my sleep because i need to sit up right to burp and feel better for like a minute then it continues i dont know what to do i hate this feeling i have been doing deep breathing and grounding activities but they work for like 5 minutes im on medication and the reason why my anxiety isnt causing me a full breakdown so i know its working what do people do to curb this feeling or am i crazy and no one deals with this,post-pandemic

ive been thinking about this a bit lately im realizing that in most spaces i have generally been disregarded when i do manage to give my input its hard as it is to get a word in because i dont always know when its okay to talk but when i do it feels like people almost ignore me currently id say that my mom and partner do it the most since i dont really talk to too many people outside work for example my work is related to child development so when my mom brought up something related and i explained how it worked she said that might be it then i reminded her i get paid to know this and she had the same epiphany she has anytime this happens at work i work with lots of data i feel like my bosses and anyone who depends on my work trusts what i say but i also frequently remember a conversation i had with a coworker last year i was showing her the processes i devised and explaining them and she seemed surprised she said wow thats really clever wait i dont know why im surprised actually i know you i feel like that interaction basically boils down how its always felt people disregard what i say or think until they see something they think is clever or smart they get surprised that i am capable of that then forget and it happens again ive talked to my partner about this and he has apologized and continues to work on it hes not autistic but is also neurodivergent so i get that he has his own struggles and is trying but its honestly really disheartening and annoying how often it feels it happens to me idk does anyone else have similar experiences or feel similarly,post-pandemic

my gym sometimes gets these new workout machines that i kinda wanna try out but i always chicken out of it because i cant figure out how they work and am afraid of embarrassing myself in front of the entire gum by using it incorrectly or accidentally falling off and im also too embarrassed to ask the staff for help because everyone else at the gym seems to get how to use the machines on the very first try i dont want them to think im stupid and incompetent im one of those people who tends to screw up at stuff when everyone else gets it right away so im really nervous when asking for help ive been trying to get into better shape but sometimes its hard to do the workout i need to do because i feel like i look stupid when i work out i even get embarrassed about sweating because i dont want people to think im gross,post-pandemic
ive spent my whole life being depressed at 9 i was sexually abused and since then ive just been trying to distract myself from me ive never had a hobby because that required alone time with me i got my first job at 14 and worked constantly to avoid thinking about the abuse most of my life ive felt lost without a hobby everyone has something theyre passionate about cars cooking baking knitting what have you as much as i tried to get into all of those things none of them became a constant in my life but i am now spending my free time with puzzles i used to love jigsaw puzzles as a kid now i do jigsaw puzzles crosswords riddles im kind of excited about this ive been so sad lately and it feels like i am taking back my life there actually is something out there to enjoy,pre-pandemic

my doctors are concerned over my blood pressure and how it relates to my ed but my bp is too high i know that low bp is found in people with eds so idk why mine is too high im not overweight and never have been ive lost a lot of weight and i havent gained i eat healthy food group wise obviously not calorie wise so idk why my bp is so high and why my doctor wants to admit me for inpatient treatment because of it if its caused by another medical condition shouldnt we focus on that instead of jumping to inpatient anyone else have a perspective i havent considered because im currently confused but i may be missing something,post-pandemic
dv trigger warning sorry for the language in advance im very pissed at the moment of writing this very long story short im planning on moving again because of loud new neighbors with ongoing domestic violence itll be the 7th time having to deal with this source of trauma and im feeling pretty fucking cursed at this point the first several times involved people i loved and cared about so hearing these things through the walls have a severe negative effect on my mental stability i get so much fight or flight adrenaline each time another sudden sound goes off from the neighbors its actually becoming physically painful and my joints are also starting to kill me every day i feel like im on the verge of a heart attack and i can barely eat or sleep anymore its irrational but im starting to believe theres some sort of sick god or force that lulls me into a false sense of security for a while before it fucks with me again im literally conditioned to never relax because the moment i can finally safely say that ive recovered from the trauma another subhuman piece of shit shows up out of nowhere and the cycle begins again any strength i had in going through it the first 6 fucking times is pretty much chipped away and i sure as fuck wont be able to tolerate it one more time without losing my shit and doing something drastic the cops are essentially useless and literally laughed at me once but thats another long story and im debating talking to the landlord right now since the last apartment i tried that with i got subtle threats from the neighbor that i couldnt get proof of despite trying to be anonymous its also illegal for me to record anything to get proof so thats fantastic the only option i have left is to leave another place i called home and let yet another cunting trashy waste of space fuckheaded piece of shit parasite invade and claim my peaceful space i found the perfect apartment in every aspect but of course this has to happen anyways if i could get a recommendation for quality noise canceling headphones that would be great i basically have dogs ears and my hearing is insanely sensitive so i would need nothing less than the best ill pay whatever i need to i have a fan and loud podcasts for white noise to take a bit of the edge off in the meantime thanks ahead for reading and possibly sharing any advice,post-pandemic

hey guys so ive been suffering from highmiddlegrade depression for 25 years now thats why im in therapy many of this is due to trauma i experienced in the last 5 years bullying toxic relationship extreme stress betrayal from former best friends and lots of fights many of the worst scenarios in some situations eventually became true and i constantly lost friends because they would show their true faces after a while things escalated horribly few months ago and thats how my anxiety of literally everything bad that could possibly happen came to power and it went beyond that like i am constantly scared that something bad happens to my mom i have a deep healthy relationship with my mother she was always there for me like car accident diseases and many more or that something bad will happen to me or to other loved ones of mine it keeps on getting aggressive day by day the meds i take do not help and the only way i am actually able to feel good is when things work out the way they should which is not the case with the current work and mental stress level just wanted to write this i because i really needed to write that down and share it to a community which understands that hope to hear from you love u guys,post-pandemic

i am not diagnosed with ptsd but was told i may have it from my therapist who is a trauma specialist regardless i have been struggling severely recently and my mental health issues have been causing me to fall behind on my school work i had a 504 plan for anxiety and chronic migraines when i was in high school but i didnt carry it over to college because i didnt feel i needed any of those accommodations anymore now i feel i definitely need accommodations but for depressionpossible ptsd and the migraines once again does ptsd or depression count as a disability you can get accommodations for if so i will definitely pursue a diagnosis as i dont want to give up on school but im not sure where to start or what accommodations could help right now im struggling most with attendance and meeting deadlines because i have such extremely low energy trouble sleeping and weird emotional spells where i literally cannot stop crying and panicking,post-pandemic
wondering if anyone else essentially has a set up of items that you use to aid in ha for instance i have a pulse ox a kardia device a spirometer a blood pressure cuff and lastly my blood glucose monitor now some of these devices are necessary for me but most were bought from ha reasons for some these devices tend to cause more worry but for me they have helped tremendously with my ha that doesnt mean i dont have spiraling moments and its funny because i know my ha issues are not as bad when im not using my devices as much curious if anyone else also has a set up and does it help or make matters worse,post-pandemic
ive been having a really hard time eating anything lately the foods that i can eat are definitely on the side of what people would consider unhealthy i know any food is better than no food but for some reason i just get so worried that the foods i can eat are going to give me diabetes or a heart disease and then i feel like i should eat less of them to mitigate that risk but than im just not eating enough in general i want to be able to have healthier foods but i physically just cannot get myself to im just confused i was diagnosed with an 7 years ago and totally fit the criteria but this feels very different and more like arfid but i also dont know and dont hear much about an arfid pipeline just the other way and then i worry i am somehow faking it i dunno definitely open to support or hearing from others who have experienced the same thing,post-pandemic
you either bottle up too much of what you are feeling and end up suffering by yourself eventually potentially leaking out and affecting others on accident ex lashing out or you end up sharing too much of your struggles that the other person in the relationship begins to get burnt out especially if dont understand what ha is or how much it can affect someone i was wondering where is the balance in terms of involving the other person in the relationship in regards to your ha and what would that look like,post-pandemic

when i got off heroin about 6 years ago i went through a phase where i would do just about anything to get off i had convinced a doctor that i needed a script for xanax when i took it i never just took one pill it was always a few that some weed and i felt golden again aside from the fact that i was just substituting addictions the problem was that all the xanax would completely obliterate my inhibitions one day i did my usual thing a handful of pills and some weed and i decided to drive downtown to see if i could find something else i didnt care what i ended up meeting a guy named chuck chuck was a crackhead i had money and wanted to get higher so chuck took me to his spot boy did i get high crack was something else we sat in my jeep and started to talk before i knew it the conversation had gotten very deep i was an affluent kid i come from a great family who loves me i went to good schools etc chuck had a hell of a life no father homeless broken in so many ways as we sat there and i told him about my life chuck said something to me that i will never forget man what are you doin down here with me if you got it like that why you livin like this i was stunned for a brief moment he put everything into perspective i had no answer to his question i realized that chuck was a human in pain not just a crackhead how could a guy whom i had just met who was sitting in my car smoking crack with me have so much compassion for me his words have stuck with me ever since that day when im struggling wanting to get high after 6 years clean at this point i think about chuck if you got it like that why you livin like this i have a great life one that i wouldnt give up for anything hopefully his words will resonate with some of you like it did for me thanks chuck,pre-pandemic

maybe i have more severe problems than just adhd but no medication or therapy seems to be helping with school neither does any amount of making the same mistakes im in my second try at college at age 25 and im not doing anything better i start skipping class just because i dont want to go because its boring and then i get behind and dont want to go back for that reason ive skipped one class for three weeks i read a lot of people on here say that last minute panic helps them push through under severe pressure and get work done but i dont think thats worked on me since i was 18 i feel literally nothing when academic deadlines pass im not depressed i just dont care about school at all but i logically recognize how important a degree is to my quality of life and how much harder it will be without one i also recognize the continuing disappointment i cause my parents at this point my question is not how can i do better in school my question is how can i even learn to care about school how can i learn to care about anything i dont immediately want to do i dont ever do anything i dont want to do,pre-pandemic

so i was diagnosed with anxiety two years ago and i have medication and ill be starting therapy so thats gotten better though maybe its that im just less stressed but ive been noticing that im more down than usual i was in a really bad place 5 years ago and those negative feelings have been coming back this past year and im going to be talking with the doctor about it at my next appointment anyway i know that anxiety and depression can come hand in hand but i dont feel like my stuff is significant enough to be depression i also low key feel like trash for having all these problems and i know its been taking a toll on my family at the same time i feel like it would make so much sense my grandma had both anxiety and depression and both me and my sister have anxiety so maybe i just got the unlucky end of the stick and landed both i dont know this probably made no sense but i really dont know how to feel right now and im just wondering if anyone else has felt the same,post-pandemic

i have quiet bpd often i dont do anything that actively harms the people in my life 95 of the time i ask them for space and feel out my emotions and simply communicate a more logical response to them about why i needed space but alone i hate them i want nothing to do with them over simple occurrences that made me feel abandoned i think about leaving them ghosting them and never ever seeing them again i think about hurting myself to make them feel even a portion of what i feel im a wreck and even though they dont see or hear absolutely any of that i still feel so guilty that i could ever ever feel that about the people i love i feel so disappointed in myself,post-pandemic
i havent made friends with someone since i was thirteen years old and im currently in college i find it exceptionally difficult to connect with new people and start casual conversations that do not involve class concepts or revolve around school because i have been alone since i was in middle school i have nobody to talk to besides myself and find it implausible to start a conversation with a stranger when ive been involuntarily isolating myself from others i tried to join clubs during club rush but i started convulsing and had to escape the environment as quickly as possible i wish i was normal and capable of forming connections with other people but its virtually impossible for me does anyone else genuinely not have any friends or anyone to converse with about their day,post-pandemic
i was diagnosed with adhd this past week im 27 and never really thought anything about it ive noticed recently ive been hyperfixated on trying to find a hobby after asking myself why do you keep doing different hobbies then dropping them then i started to connect the dots since i was younger and decided to go get checked out by my psychologist after testing she said it was no question i have adhd i was put on strattera and it seems to be working but im still sitting here looking for a hobby i cant stand just sitting here doing anything is there any hobby any of you do that you can easily pick up anywhere and be able to do said hobby or maybe something small thanks,post-pandemic

cw suicide some sexual content my name is james and i am 40 in my late 20s when i first started making enough money to bring home bottles of liquor to build a liquor cabinet i started noticing that i wouldnt make it through an evening movie without having five six drinks i remember my first real hangover i was 28 my friend thomas and i went to a restaurant i had been drinking the night before and i told myself i wouldnt drink that night he persuaded me to split a bottle of wine we did and we merrily went back to my house he had a couple of friends come over we started drunkenly playing the piano it was fun one of his friends was kind of notworldly she asked if i wanted another drink and i said yes she filled a rocks glass to the brim with tequila and handed it to me i drank it in five minutes i couldnt taste that it was straight alcohol i stood up and fell over i stood up and fell over i fell into the bathroom i fell into the tub i fell out of the bathroom i told the roomful of people i had to go to bed i do not remember the next day except that i was crying for most of it i stopped having booze in the house my drinking was daily but under control at 37 i started dating a wonderful man he was younger than me taller than me smarter than me and he adored me he wanted us to move in together get a dog together i told him that i wanted to wait a few days before our first year anniversary he told me i was the love of his life he told me he wanted to spend the rest of his life with me i called my mom the next day i told her he was the one i told her i wanted to buy us a dog my mom and i bought a beautiful dog her name is charlie my boyfriend was overjoyed at 39 we found a perfect house to live in in the city but in a quiet part on the outskirts of downtown there was a backyard and a basement we had a housewarming and i felt truly happy i do freelance work and i lost my biggest client a few days after we moved in i became depressed i spent a week in bed i had joined a different kind of gym one close to the new place that has classes i bought a membership i found myself unable to go i was too depressed my boyfriend wanted to have a liquor cabinet i spent the first two months feeling terrible i thought it was about the loss of my client no i was drinking a lot and i didnt even really realize it i was emptying the bottles one by one and replacing them every week i started to put on a little weight and lose muscle i have always been skinny and fit but i started to get a paunch my depression got worse i started sending angry messages to people who i was mad at usually late at night or first thing in the morning id post impulsive things on social media a friend who id sent an angry message to wrote on social media that i was an abusive person posted it on facebook screenshotted my message to her i spiralled out it was 6am and i sent a suicide note and picked up a knife from the drawer i sharpened it and started walking down to the lake i was going to slit my wrists and get in the water to bleed out as i was walking down the friend emailed me and begged me to live and apologized i started crying i walked around the city by myself when i came home i lay in bed with my stillsleeping boyfriend i told him i loved him the police had been called by one of the recipients of my suicide note they took me to the hospital and confined me they released me a couple days later i started seeing a therapist who was helping me deal with my issues i put a lot of stock in the opinions of others and can feel crushed when somebody doesnt like me or seems to respect me i downplayed my drinking to my therapist my boyfriend had always been sexually compulsive in our relationship he had assured me that he loved our sex life but that he liked sleeping around we had rules but he tended to break them or just behave in insensitive ways his compulsive behaviour increased i would see him surfing grindr every morning as i made breakfast he slept with a man once when he was annoyed that id gone to see a movie with a friend he didnt like he was constantly sexting people his exlover including two of my own friends i snooped on his phone and was angry about the extent of his sexual activity the sexting i saw that he was speaking poorly about my sexual performance to a group chat with his friends in it i saw that he was speaking about how much he missed his exlover to his friends after i told him id snooped and i was hurt he told his friends id snooped they told him that trust was no longer present in our relationship they started telling him to leave me his compulsion increased as did my drinking when he worked late i would have five to eight 25oz drinks before he got home i would smoke a little weed before he got back and pretend i was really high when he wasnt working late and was home i hid a bottle of tequila on the back porch i would step out for a cigarette and take swigs from the bottle without him knowing one night i made dinner and had a plate made for him i thought hed be getting home around 8 but he didnt get home until midnight he decided to hook up with somebody on his way home around 11 i was wasted i was trying to put his plate of food in a warm oven in and out so the fish didnt dry out i spilled quinoa all over the oven i was too drunk and the oven was too hot i turned the oven on self clean i passed out in bed my boyfriend came home and i was passed out and there was smoke pouring out of the kitchen i kept telling myself i needed to stop my drinking became like a ritual my last drink i would tell myself and toast to myself i would have a second and a third each one feeling like my last i would have my sixth and say to myself im so happy that as of tomorrow im a nondrinker this would happen every night i was losing days of work to my hangovers my boyfriend and i were fighting more i was in worse shape than id ever been we went to the beach and he took a photo of me my gut was visible and unattractive and he commented maybe not the best angle i woke up the next morning hungover crying and said i feel fat he was unsympathetic our sex life became strange hed initiated our morning activity by putting my hand on him i am the more active lover but he started being unappreciative the last time i performed oral sex on him i asked him how it was and he just said im late for work and got up and got dressed i went out again with my friend that he doesnt like we were drinking at the bar i came home and my boyfriend picked a fight with me he started yelling at me about how he respects me less for hanging out with this particular friend he called my friend a shithead he went on his group chat and posted a long story about how shitty my friend was and how he respected me less for hanging out with him i told him that his behaviour tracked as abusive youre not supposed to isolate your partner from his friends he went on his group chat and told them that i accused him of being an abuser i had done no such thing i just asked him to stop picking on my friend he yelled at me i will never stop shittalking him we resolved the fight a few days later he apologized for what he did he said he had his own requests he told me i needed to secure a new client he told me i could no longer be depressed i had to get out of it he said finally you really need to up your sex game i called my mom the next morning and said i thought we were going to break up his birthday was a few days later i was anxious about being around his social circle they all had been hearing that i was a terrible person in group chat they were warm but distant i started hearing snippets of conversation and thinking they were talking about me they told me about a plan to sing karaoke the next weekend they implied that i was invited i am great at karaoke and they always invite me even when my boyfriend isnt available i didnt drink at dinner but when i got home i snuck a few drinks in before bed that weekend i wasnt invited to karaoke i was depressed and i stayed home by myself and drank i didnt reach out and ask if i could come i made up my mind to break up with my boyfriend it was clear he wasnt happy his sexual compulsion suggested that something was up his dismissiveness toward my sexual performance suggested hed lost his attraction toward me he came home and i told him i didnt like the way he talked about me in group chat i told him i didnt like the way he talked about my friends i told him he could be casually cruel to me i told him i wanted to break up he said he had wanted to break up for a while we went to bed and it was ok the next day while he was at work i snooped on his computer again he had already joined tinder and changed his grindr status to newly single he was making plans to visit his exlover he had made a plan to fly to chicago so sleep with a man he had a crush on over instagram i became depressed and i started drinking a lot he moved out a few days later without him in the house i was drinking constantly one night feeling belittled and sad i got blackout drunk i was smoking on the patio passed out and i suddenly regained consciousness i had fallen over the railing my head was on the stone below my leg caught in the railing i went inside i didnt realize but id given myself whiplash and a concussion i went on twitter and started posting i posted that my dick was fine and i couldnt believe my boyfriend didnt think so i posted that he was a size queen i posted that his friends didnt know how terrible hed been to me i posted a photo of my dick and said look this is what he says is not good enough my boyfriend came over in a rush he saw that my head was bleeding and put rubbing alcohol on it he stayed the night i cried in bed the next morning i told him i didnt want him to leave he texted me that night that he missed me he told me he loved me he told me he was sorry he drove me away with his sexual activity and belittlement i spoke to him the next day he said he hadnt meant what he had texted that i was exhausting and he wanted a break he did want to break up i was devastated every night i still was getting blackout drunk last night i started looking around the house for some means to kill myself i was going to hang myself with the dog leash i was going to cut my wrists in the tub at 1am i called my boyfriend instead i told him that i was an alcoholic and i needed treatment i told him that he needed therapy for his sex addiction i told him our relationship was too good too loving to give up so easily i told him that i loved him i told him that he had told me once that i was one of the best lovers hed ever had i told him that a good sexual relationship requires work from both partners i reminded him that hed told me i was the love of his life and he wanted to spend the rest of his life with me i barely remember the conversation i was so drunk this morning i was crying and hungover i called my mom and told her i was an alcoholic i called my boss and told him the same and that i needed help he agreed to be part of my support group i called my friend jeff who is in aa and had previously told me it had changed his life and that he was going to help me whenever i felt i needed it jeff agreed to take me to a meeting this sunday he told me i could call him any time i told my boyfriend that i didnt want him to be a part of my support group i told him i wanted space for now but i wanted to see him in a week so i could tell him that id been sober for a week he told me hed booked an appointment for a couples

so this is a half rant half question ive 18m been trying to find out what medication to take with my psychiatrist and the results so far were no effect 2 no effect 3 final choice so far the main character of this story 4 too many risks to even consider taking so the new medication has been kicking me in the metaphorical azz for an entire week straight ive been getting terrible stomachaches throughout the day and felt lightheaded only after taking the medication it got to the point i had to call off school for a day because of the medication now to the main part of the story have you ever been blamed for experiencing some side effect or had it thrown onto something else like staying on the computer or something well thats basically the story of my family and my gym teacher my mother has no idea any of the side effects and my shenanigans with school were even happening because of her explosive reactions to everything around her i couldnt risk another stupid argument which could end up with my personal items as well as my pet being thrown out the window so i just didnt tell her she never asked and i proceeded to talk to my doctor and psychiatrist seemingly the side effects are not as bad anymore but i dont wanna jinx it yall have any tips for making the side effects more managable im 3 months away from graduation and i cant really risk being barely able to function because the thing i use to help exist doesnt agree with my existence,post-pandemic

warning mention of illness cancer i used to just tell myself that i was being irrational that nothing bad was going to happen and then welltime happened so bad things did happen i had health scares and the people i loved got cancer everything felt horrifying all within a few months suddenly all of my obsessive health anxiety became more than just a fear it became real i always feared that everyone i love as well as myself would get sick and then it happened all at once with time im learning that everyone gets sick and we all die obviously i knew this already but now i know i am so aware to the point that i cannot think of anything else im trying my best to just accept reality life and death but it eats me up and spits me out every day im wasting the life i do have worrying about the life i wont have im wasting my time with my ill loved ones worrying about the day theyre gone instead of appreciating them while theyre in front of me but i cant stop i only spiral how do you cope what mindset or thought gets you through it yes i am getting help i just want to hear from others who struggle thank you,post-pandemic
hi everyone ive posted previously about being a psychologist and having a colleague report me to the psychology board for health concerns quick summary my mental health wasnt great earlier this year two hospitalizations in close succession i was suspecting i had bipolar ii and was trying to seek treatment for this i also had a bunch of serious stressors going on in my personal life including a death within my family my work performance wasnt impacted i took days off when i needed them and i was receiving positive work reviews so my struggles were only in my personal life anyway this colleague reported me to my professional board and an investigation into my ability to work as a psychologist began five and a half months later im informed of the boards decision theyve decided to take no further action so i can keep practising as i have been my friends and family are telling me i should feel happy and relieved and just smile its over but actually im stormclouding heres why theyve revealed to me which records theyve been looking over to come to their decision 1 the reports from the colleague 2 my reply 3 my treating psychiatrists letter outlining my diagnosis and treatments 4 my clinical psychologists letter detailing my family social and psychiatric history 5 my entire private clinical psychology file with notes from each of my sessions 6 my hospital records 7 my gp records 8 interview with my big boss regarding my work performance while some of these may be reasonable to review say a letter from my treating team regarding my current wellbeing i dont see how its warranted to look through many of these records without my consent how was my family history relevant i feel completely exposed and violated ive spoken to the ombudsman who has assured me that the board is simply allowed to access these records also it was such a drawn out process and i wasnt told anything along the way i needed to ask multiple times to be told what was in the notification they were concerned about my colleagues confidenfiality i also wasnt told about any kind of timeline i needed to call and specifically ask about progress hearing date etc so yeah im relieved that therell be no further action but wtf was that whole process another update is that ill be moving interstate for a new job and a new start soon my new role is a senior mental health clinician and i cant wait to make the most of my passion for supporting people with mental health conditions we need to be looked out for especially when we go through tough times never ever made to feel exposed judged disrespected anyway if you are a health professional practising in australia be aware of these privacy laws that the boards apparently have thanks again for all the people who have reached out previously,pre-pandemic
so basically the issue at hand is that i dont see life going anywhere im 21 this yeah and as far as life is heading i may as well just pull the plug i used to enjoy being alone but now it honestly hurts everyone busy with things at hand everybody has something of someone to be with and then theres those who have nothing it honestly reached the point where i hate having free time because i dont know what to do with it and im not the type to enjoy learning something new all the time like i finish a game or get a 80 then i jump to another game if this makes sense some people if anyone even interacts with this rant of mine would say youre still young life is still ahead of you so on but seriously what should i do what do yall do to feel less lonely if thats even a thing distracting myself with a hobby or work or studying no longer works,post-pandemic

its a weird thing that ive done since around 12ish years old but ive had symptoms since the age of 3 so lets start off with some background background info start what started the whole thing was every adult in my life telling me that i wasnt allowed to be mentally ill and my dad told me at 9 years old that if i actually heard voices and saw things the doctors would shove insulin in my brain and kill me i tried getting help again at 12 years old and my mom reluctantly agreed she sat with me to make sure i didnt say anything stupid on the phone call with the uc davis psychosis center the lady who picked up the phone was nice but she couldnt help me after id explained my symptoms and then the length of time in which id been experiencing them she said im sorry but we only help those whove been experiencing psychosis for at least a year we cant help you id recommend choosing a specialist and that was it she hung up my mom grew enraged at me for lying and wasting everyones time but my symptoms never went away then went into foster care when i was still 12 years old on may 30 2017 and got out of it december 2 2021 when i was freshly 18 during that time though they appointed me with courtordered therapy it was horrible and invalidating i was blatantly abused by my last therapist who also pushed for not having me diagnosed with anything except ptsd i was recognized for both did as well as schizophrenia by my psychiatrist of 5 years at that point as hed been appointed to me when i first went into the foster system and he said that since my foster mother didnt believe me to be that mentally ill i should just act happy because if i acted long enough it would happen that was the best option i had at 17 he said the voices would only get worse when im stressed but theyre horrible all the time end of background info throughout those years though i found myself masking my symptoms so well around other people that when i finally got to the point it was showing no matter what i tried i crumbled before i could take one of the voices brutally screeching at me and barely flinch only an eye twitch but now 20 years old i physically cringe and lean away from the direction its coming from feel free to ask questions or share your experiencesthoughts just looking for some validation i guess i always think im faking because i was able to mask it at all,post-pandemic

this post is about my experience with health anxiety and how i totally overcame it i hope this can help someone out there going through probably the most scary time of their life the beginning a year and a half ago i developed the symptoms of dry eye syndrome light sensitivity trouble reading otherwise i was a totally healthy 21 year old male when i shared the symptoms with a relative she convinced me it must be something terrible like diabetes or ms rather than immediately consult a doctor i spent the next couple of weeks googling symptoms sure enough a few days after first reading the symptoms of ms my left leg started to become relentlessly tense one night my leg continually tensed up every couple of minutes and made it impossible to sleep when i finally got out of bed in the morning i went to take a shower in the hot shower my head started to feel hot and i suddenly felt very nauseous i ran over to the sink and dry heaved and then my vision started to fade to black after sitting down on the floor my vision slowly came back but i was already convinced something was seriously wrong with me went to the er all tests came back clear and they sent me home they didnt know what caused it but said that sometimes it just happens in the back of my mind i already knew that something was wrong with me and continued to google symptoms to try and solve my own case over that next month i went back to the emergency room 4 times had an ambulance come to my house and spent a night in the hospital the time the ambulance came to my house both of my arms had gone completely numb from hyperventilation during a panic attack and i was convinced i was going to die i vividly remember the nurse asking me on a scale of 110 how much pain are you in and i answered im not in any pain i just feel like im about to die as far as i could tell my body was being controlled by a mysterious illness that could suddenly onset at any time and make me feel like i was about to pass out every time i went to the emergency room i said basically the same thing i feel light headed like im going to pass out only of course they knew that wasnt really what was happening because my blood pressure was always just fine unfortunately no one really conveyed this to me i developed a severe case of agoraphobia i went from being an independent adult male to sleeping in the same bed as my safe person again because i was so scared something was going to happen to me in my sleep because this all started with me passing out in the shower i became deathly afraid of the shower i didnt shower for almost two months i couldnt really leave the house at all and if i had to i had to stay near my safe person at all times i couldnt do something as simple as sit alone in a store even just walking into the store made me feel a strong sudden wave of anxiety turning the corner during my four emergency room visits and hospital stay i had an unbelievable amount of tests done i got two ct scans of my head two chest xrays an mri a heart echo a stress test about 20 blood tests a 24 hour heart monitor as well as many other tests all came back negative and oddly enough not one doctor ever mentioned the possibility that it could just be anxiety i had to figure this out on my own the exact instant i realized i had health anxiety was when i finally realized that i could actually trigger my symptoms for example every time i would go to a doctors appointment i felt like i was going to pass out this happened whether it was an appointment with my primary care physician or my ophthalmologist i literally had to lay down in the waiting room of my ophthalmologist because i just felt so light headed when i would go there but then oddly enough i noticed that the symptoms totally subsided on the way home every time it seems almost impossible to not put two and two together here but it took me months to realize that perhaps it was anxiety causing me to experience these symptoms and that this would explain why they onset right before going to a doctors appointment at this point after googling i came across white coat syndrome and i knew what i had i told my neurologist i thought it may just be anxiety he said it was possible but he wanted to run some more tests i let him run the tests but in the meantime i started to treat the anxiety on my own with lifestyle changes i started going out for strenuous walks for thirty minutes a day as a form of exercise even though my heart felt like it was palpitating out of my chest and i was scared to death i started forcing myself to do things on my own the first thing i did on my own was stand in line without my safe person to get my allergy medication prescription at a pharmacy i felt strongly like i was going to pass out and desperately wanted to go sit down but the book i read said the only way i could treat the anxiety was to face the fear and try and force myself to pass out of course i never did pass out it was all in my head after just about a month of self care my extreme agoraphobia was gone i was taking showers again once a day and i was going out and doing things completely by myself a few months later i got an opportunity to take my treatment to the next level move across the country to live with a friend for a couple of months i took the opportunity to finally break away from my safe person all together and it turned out to be the final piece the remaining minor symptoms i had dissipated conclusion this is a heavily condensed version of my story it would be nearly impossible to go into full detail as this took place over a grueling 89 months i would however like to list some of the symptoms i experienced that totally went away i think this could be helpful to someone who has some of these symptoms and has been told its anxiety but doesnt quite believe it or think they will go away dont get me wrong if you have any of these symptoms and you havent been checked out you need to do that first until you remove that piece of doubt from your mind your recovery will be much harder symptoms i experienced at one point or another that are now totally gone panic attacks 4 er visits in a month 1 ambulance call sensations of abnormal heart beat sweating arms going numb hyperventilation extremely tense painful left leg this happened for weeks at a time caused by stress according to neurologist constant eye twitching not like tourettes but rather a constant twitching sensation in the eyelid sensation of abnormal heartbeat i was obsessed with my heartbeat and convinced something was wrong with it i could notice it at almost all times feeling of not getting enough air in this was a strong sensation i often had around bed time i literally felt like i was just not breathing in enough air to survive trying to control my breathing this was one of the most frustrating symptoms i could not seem to take my mind off of controlling my breathing i found a simple cure for this in the section below ringing in the ears sometimes it was constant for days at a time sometimes it was one of my ears suddenly going out for a few minutes seeing things shapes colors etc when my eyes were closed this is one of the weirdest ones because at the time it greatly concerned me and i remember always paying attention to what i could see with my eyes closed and now i cant even remember what they looked like or ever paying attention to that again feeling of lightheadedness pretty self explanatory very common in anxiety arms going numb this would happen any time i was in a stressful situation for example before a doctors appointment or even when i went and played poker a couple of months after i had mostly recovered and even then every time i bluffed my arms would start to tingle and eventually go borderline numb was told this has to do with the adrenaline overloading my system 247 constantly feeling off balance like the floor is a bouncy castle i went to the doctor specifically for this issue as well and he checked my ears and assured me this sensation was all in my head and it turns out it was was a very freaky thing i was literally having to lean on the countertops in the kitchen just to wash dishes at one point and now it is totally gone derealization i would constantly get the sensation that my arms werent really my arms or that i couldnt feel my face i would literally pinch my arms every few minutes just to make sure they were mine and that i could feel them developed an extreme sensitivity to caffeine used to drink 400mg in the morning now i couldnt even drink a cup of coffee without feeling sick to my stomach doctor told me to quit altogether so i tapered off until i quit constantly lifting my arms smiling due to fear of having a stroke since one time the doctor mentioned i may of had a minor stroke i became obsessed with lifting my arms to make sure one wasnt weaker than the other and smiling to make sure my face wasnt drooping the list goes on and on much of the stuff i am no doubt forgetting tips start an exercise program much of anxiety is simply excess energy that needs to get expended its much harder to be anxious when you are tired and besides if you have anxiety related to your heartbeat this is a way to face that the first few days i was convinced my heart was beating like crazy just when walking but the more you do it the less it happens and eventually it goes away all together the goal is to desensitize yourself from focusing on your heart beat always face your fears every time you give in to anxiety it grows a little bit every time you face it it shrinks a little bit this is the basis of all treatment for anxiety anxiety makes you uncomfortable but it is not harmful the goal is to recognize that it is purely discomfort and there is really nothing to be afraid of for dealing specifically with the focusing on breathing thing i recommend a great article here this article literally single handedly cured this symptom and this is the one that i experienced the longest of all of them even after everything was gone i could not seem to stop focusing on my breathing the gist of the article is that you are doing this because you are scared of the thought of focusing on your breathing you are scared by the idea that you cannot stop and so your brain keeps paying attention because your brain loves scary things so in sense make paying attention to your breathing as boring as possible set alarms throughout the day to remind you to pay attention to your breathing seems counter intuitive but wow does it actually work read as much literature as you can from well reputed sources on health anxiety and panic attacks i recommend especially dare but i would also simply recommend watching this short video i also used an anxietyphobiapanic attack workbook that helped a lot although i cannot remember the name of it now never ever google symptoms ever not because you should be scared by what you find because you shouldnt but because you arent smart enough to recognize that you shouldnt be scared if everyone could take their findings with a grain of salt and recognize that they have no idea what they are doing and should draw no conclusions from what they find there would be no issue but everyone thinks of themselves as smart and competent and so they think they are likely to come up with accurate conclusions wrong even people who know the relevant biology and anatomy cant properly dissect a medical journal and you think you can do it as a layman doctors understand things about frequencies and qualifying characteristics for diagnoses that none of us will ever understand and cant be found in a quick google search please leave anything medically related up to the professionals at all times considering taking a calcium magnesium zinc supplement recommended by many resources for dealing with anxiety you should probably quit caffeine i was the biggest coffee head you can imagine and even though i was forced to quit by an extreme sensitivity to caffeine i developed i probably would of quit anyway life is much better without it anyways its hard to imagine why i ever needed it in the first place at this point now i just wake up and feel great not like i need a cup of coffee immediately copious amounts of decaf satisfy my requirements for the taste of black coffee i dont really use reddit very often so i dont plan on sticking around the community to help people or anything i just wanted to make my one big contribution and give back the best way i could by creating a post i think will help someone out there and i wanted to do it before it was too late and ive moved on so far that i totally forget the details of this thing that happened to me best of luck to all of you life is really great when you dont think you are dying all of the time,pre-pandemic
a friend of mine recently died after having been a secret highfunctioning alcoholic their liver failed and they wouldnt get a transplant because of answers they had provided to their doctor during a previous visit i was shocked that i never had noticed that they were an alcoholic despite having been on multiple vacations together this prompted me to look into alcoholism and try to understand it better i myself on average have maybe one drink per week despite having a small mezcal and whiskey collection but this experience still left me much more suspect of any alcohol consumption on a recent allinclusive vacation this promoted me to not drink any alcohol every few days despite my friends drinking every day because we are on vacation and its free now to my concern my dead friends spouse who supposedly didnt know about their spouses alcoholism either seems to have a unchanged relationship with alcohol they were on vacation with us and drank 3 drinks every day when i mentioned that im having a dry day to stay safe they said theyd do that after our vacation even though their drinking wasnt even part of the discussion this came off as unnesecerily defensive to me one time my spouse and i ran into this friend while they were on their way to get a drink on their own even though they new that everyone else was hanging out and had invited them no concern about wanting some alone time but that that time was spent getting a fancy drink made me think twice my friend does these allinclusive vacations every other month or so for 1 week im not sure how much they drink at home but whenever we visit wine gets opened but its the combination of what i perceive as fairly high drinking with the fact that i cannot see any change in behavior or even how they talk about alcohol after they spouse died from it that has me really worried my spouse and i have had alcoholism and new things we learned about it pop into our minds with some regulatory since the passing of our good friend my spouse in particular has spent countless hours talking with our surviving friend about their loss but the alcoholism itself was never much discussed by our friend id have excpected them to be more suspect of alcohol than we are but that doesnt seem the case at all their new partner voiced concern in private that they sometimes say they cannot sleep and take a shot to address it this seems crazy to me all this leaves me worried that my surviving friend is addicted themselves and its trying to hide it as well or is lying to themselves or worse knew about their spouses alcoholism all along but were happy being alcoholics together am i overreacting since i never was much of a drinker if not is there anything i can do to help not lose this friend to alcohol as well,post-pandemic

long story short my mom tried to unalive herself and take me with her in 7th grade she cried and begged me and told me things before this incident she was still emotionally well i wont say abusive but she was traumatized herself if i get 90 i am worthless why did she give birth to me she is going to die early because of me if i dont do hw once bc im sick or anything she gaslighted me and told me if you are gonna do this then why dont you just end it just dont do anything screaming which ended with her crying and with dead eyes telling me reminding me i am going to be left alone with noone besides me because she is going to die because of me etc etc anyways back to ptsd every time i do something wrong and my mom gets upset or if i get a bad score i go into endless spiral of anxiety which always ends with me begging my mom not to kill herself i am sorry i will do my best please dont leave me and hyperventilating crying which happens so suddenly i genuinely dont have what to do if i tell someone they will report my parents and that idea petrifies me since i believe that she will try to end herself again i know she wont but i cant help it this is tiring ive been like this for months now i dont know why its hitting me so hard suddenly,post-pandemic
sleeping with another human in the room is a big struggle for me even worse if im sharing a bed with them and even worse with a new person but i had my first sleepover with my girlfriend we only held hands and then i cried and we built a blanket wall so we wouldnt have any accidental skintoskin contact but then i successfully fell asleep and slept through the night i almost always have to sneak off to the couch either because i cant get to sleep at all or because i woke up in the night and freaked out but im very pleased today just had to share my excitement with people who understand,pre-pandemic
hi all this is a burner account for a couple of reasons for privacy and because this story is something i likely wouldnt share with most i was raised by 2 high functioning addictsalcoholics my life isnt exactly tragic sure ive struggled but who hasnt my parents were late to having me im an only child so that dynamic itself is definitely strange i would describe my father as a dreamer one stuck in a nostalgic loop of life always looking for the next party never thinking of anyone but himself he still uses and his life is less to be desired he reminds me of a childyoung adult more often than my father i feel bad for him sometimes simply because hes so sick with the disease my mother got sober when i was about 11 i always felt far away from her because i didnt understand why she was gone all the time they got divorced when i was in high school cue depression anxiety angst the usual suspects for reference im 20 now and never had a lick of alcohol ive never been drunk i have smoked pot but had a bad experience ive gone through many many awkward conversations of oh im sober when people my age ask to do things with me its also strange because nobody really understands why i do it what im getting along to is that im scared ive sat in on many aa meetings with my mother and heard many stories of everything i can imagine alcohol ruins peoples lives undisputed but im also getting this fear of missing out on the things that people do my age and im turning 21 which is the big drinking holiday along with most holidays lol should i try it or hedge my bets and not is it not worth it sorry if this is the wrong post for this sub i just wanted to get a lot of different opinions about what im feeling ive gone through therapy and have recently been getting on my self help train again so i think this is definitely coupled with that lol thanks for reading 3,post-pandemic

im not diagnosed with ptsd being honest im not quite even sure what it is exactly but i just see myself have gone through something traumatic for me that afterwards keeps still coming up bothering me and stuff and figured ptsd is the closest thing rn and this may be a start to helping this issue im having in august my bsf batman came to stay for two weeks and near the end this one night we were both rly drunk and high so i wasnt fully sure what was going on in the moment i just knew it made me feel really really really uncomfortable and like sickened but afterwards i know now that i was being taken advantage of in the moment but basically we were just in bed and she made me do stuff to her like physically moved my hands to her private places and when id hesitate bc i didnt want to she would say like how its okay and stuff and she moved my hand more or closer so my attempt at stopping got shut down and i didnt know what to do i just wanted it to stop and didnt like where my hand was so i just tried to give her what she wanted so it would stop since pulling away didnt work idk why i didnt just get up and yell at her or something idk i hate it idk why i couldnt have just idk anything else i just didnt know what was really happening idk but then many months later she ended up bringing it back up and shit there was a lotttttt more to the situation than what ive said and it was just really messy and thats when i properly realized i had got taken advantage of and batman really isnt who i thought she was which was one of the most incredible human beings i have ever encountered on this earth and ever since that just like now its half a year later in total and i been keep getting random reminders like ill be laying in my bed and my room will look and feel how it did when batman was doing that to me and was over here and the air will just feel like it did when she was here and it makes me feel like how i did when she did that to me and it makes me feel like scared and confused and overwhelmed when i get these random feelings cause it feels like im back in those two weeks she was here and i just dont understand whats happening most stuff i can just forget about and move on but this keeps happening and it not letting me move on ive even went from secretly hoping batman reaches back out and wants to be friends again to now i just hate it and i hate this feeling and i just want her gone and i want it all gone forever ive never experienced a traumatic event before even tho im 18 so idk whats going on,post-pandemic
we had been talking for a few weeks after meeting in person through mutuals and hooked up on valentines day the day after i go back home i live an hour away i get asked to come back and sleep over again obviously i take up the offer and we have another amazing time just sleeping together and cuddling for the whole day and i go back home were just texting back and forth about random stuff and then queue a message that triggers me your whole persona makes you seem like a hoe excuse me just because i have a high sexdrive and im a genuine person who listens to what people say and am super engaged in conversations im such the opposite of a hoe i dont even respond to most messages on dating apps because im very selective and guarded with the people i let into my life so i screen recorded my messages on hinge to show i dont have a hoe persona that theyre accusing me of my body count is below 15 which i consider just normal for a 23 year old then i get asked if im bisexual they are too which is why they suspected i was as well and i say yes and we eventually get to the topic of how my best friend had made a sexual approaches onto me as i had awaken to them giving me oral which when i was aware of the situation immediately stopped them and told them never to do that again then i get called a red flag for having had a history of doing stuff with a bestfriend and when i tell them that it hurts to be stereotyped as a red flag something that was out of my control they back pedal and say that im not a red flag a whole but that one specific quality is a red flag i dont see how thats any different but okay i guess im really getting emotionally vulnerable at this point and as we keep talking i get asked about my sexual preferences and i divulge that i had an ex who i dated when i was 18 they were 25 wanted me to degrade them verbally and we would have very toxic hate fucks where we would try to wreck each other emotionally and physically which ended after i told the ex to go kill themselves after they said they wanted to die and its all my fault they feel suicidal i regretted this immediately after i said it and they left me saying that theyd drive off a cliff but they didnt thankfully i tell them how i felt that relationship had skewed my taste towards sadism and told them well do you think im a terrible person now red flag and they respond with no youre not the person who you were 5 years ago and that they still feel the same about me before i told them this they still like me if im being honest i was self sabotaging to hopefully make them think i wasnt worth trying to maintain a relationship with so i can prevent myself from getting hurt by rejection out of my control but instead they accepted me which emotionally threw me for a loop as now im getting mixed signals but also getting reassured i then get asked to just be cuddle buddies as they thought the sex wasnt going to work out between us as they didnt prefer my preferences i think okay wow they dont want to have sex with me anymore because they think im crazydoesnt like me as much anymore i respond the morning after with this ill be honest with you redacted name i think im way too attracted to you as a person physically to just keep things as cuddle buddies plus i dont want to force you to do stuff that you dont like and honestly i understand if we part ways here thank you for those two days and all the time we spent talking to each other i legitimately thought i wouldnt be able to find someone to have these kind of feelings but now i know its possible they jokingly respond with hahah omg are you breaking up w me and you dont wanna talk still i respond with i mean i do its just that if i keep talking to you just trying to be cuddle buddies or just talking in general its going to be bad for me since i think i actually like you which isnt good for just being cuddle buddies or just talking then they say i mean we dont have to label it just talk and see to which i begrudgingly agree too since i cant think of any valid reason to refuse but the damage has been done i dont know if its all in my head or what but i feel as if they arent considering me as a serious potential partner anymore and will just be using me as a plushie doll to cuddle with at night i feel like they no longer long for me like they did just a few days ago i stupidly messaged themi miss you and they didnt response to that but instead acknowledged every other part of the message except that do you not miss me do you not like me why are you talking to me if you dont want to have sex with me the overall responses back to my messages i feel like they have been less enthusiastic and more theyve been responding like its a chore while i feel like ive been putting in more effort what did i do wrong why am i like this i hate this feeling that makes me feel like im not in control of my emotions i dissociated all of today due to this emotional distress i skipped school because i just felt so shit and out of it and have only just now slowly started to feel like im present in my own body again i wish they had just let me go by saying that they understood my decision to leave instead of giving me hope by them saying to not label things and to see where things go were not in a relationship so i cant ask for reassurance to kind of ground me into not spiraling into these thoughts the unknown scares me so much i dont want to go through all of this to only be rejected in the end for who i really am that would be the absolute worst i hate this honestly i feel like id rather die than have keep going through something like this again i know how this is going to end with me heartbroken or me sabotaging it and i hate falling in love tldr feel like im going crazy,post-pandemic
ive been lonely for years ive been in and out of all kinds of toxic friend groups and ive never really felt like i fit with them this year i found a new friend group and theyre amazing as soon as i started talking to them i felt like i finally found my people its been around 5 months now but im starting to feel alone again i knew it would take some time to get close to them but it feels like ive gotten as close as i can get but im still not with them if that makes any sense they still have their other group chat and ive talked to one of my friends the one im closest with a bit about it she said i matter and that im part of the group but i dont know if i believe it i just feel so lonely nobody ever texts me they never hang out with me outside of school and i havent been on call with anyone in over 5 months is it my fault i need help what do i do,post-pandemic

theres how much your body weighs and then theres stuff like water and feces that arent really part of your fatmuscleliving body but still weigh a bunch so if you eat 500kcal per day but it contains lots of sodium and carbs your body will hold more water than usually you are 100 losing fatmuscle but the extra water might make the scale not move or you eat 500kcal per day but thats way too little obviously and longer term restriction has caused your intestines to slow down significantly you havent let out any of that indigestible shitheh and it basically weighs as much as your food youre losing fatmuscle but your scale wont move thats all calories are all that matters and if youre eating an impossibly unhealthily small amount of food youre 1000 losing weight the scale is just not the best arbitur for what youre losing in those two scenarios you can probably do the math and see what you lost in true weight if youre a nerd like me its actually surprisingly accurate considering a 100kcal lower tdee since im uw and has probably caused my thyroid to not work well oh and up to 200 less if youve lost your period,pre-pandemic

im excited to share a project im currently working on called about my illness its a platform designed with a simple yet powerful purpose to help those of us with mental health disorders communicate our experiences to friends and family members when words fail us mental health is a journey thats deeply personal to the one experiencing issues and talking about it can be incredibly tough sometimes trying to explain what were going through to someone who hasnt experienced it can feel like speaking a different language thats where about my illness comes in about my illness offers a collection of anonymous letters written by individuals who are living with various mental health disorders these letters articulate the writers experiences struggles and feelings in a way thats raw and relatable if you find a letter that resonates with your own experience you can share it with a friend or family member its a way to say this is what its like without having to find the perfect words yourself i believe that understanding is the first step toward empathy and support whether youre struggling to communicate the nuances of your disorder or youre a friendfamily member looking to deepen your understanding about my illness aims to bridge that gap this project was born out of personal experiences and a desire to make a difference in how we talk about and understand mental health i am continuously looking to expand the collection of letters to cover as many disorders and experiences as possible if youve been looking for a way to share your story anonymously or help someone understand what youre going through i invite you to visit the website your feedback stories and participation can make this into a truly impactful resource lets start changing the conversation around mental health one letter at a time i did obtain mod support prior to posting here as i am not looking to upset any of you or the mods in any way thank you for reading and for your support of one another,post-pandemic

i just overshared to a work colleaguefriendly acquaintance about a personal incident that happened to me about another work colleague a few years ago i explained how i was bullied and how it was an embarrassing situation and about a mistake i made at work a long time ago that all started the bullying she seemed shocked and said nice things now she is working with the same people and i wish i hadnt shared anything im worried she will tell others about what happened to me or that i spoke about it as things have settled down a lot recently at work and i have now formed civil working relationships with these people i feel she is a nice person and hopefully wont do so intentionally but i probably should have held back how do i stop worrying i cant stop the anxiety about what i have said how do i move on,post-pandemic
i decided to finally quit drinking after years of getting drunk either with friends or by myself my poor wife had to suffer because of me and i cant continue to hurt her i did not drink every day or even every weekend but at least twice a month i would start drinking beer late in the evening usually while fishing on my boat by myself and would not stop until like 5 or 6 in the morning i usually would start drinking on my boat and would continue to drink after trailering my boat out of the marina on the way home i would stop at gas stations to buy even more beer and continue to drink and drive after cleaning my boat i would get back in my truck and continue to drink beer driving back and forth to the gas station for more beer until 5 or 6 in the morning the only reason i would even stop is because my wife would wake up around that time and catch me i was not an emotional drunk i was just a happy drunk jamming out to classic rock in my truck drinking by myself i know i had to stop because i was risking my career by drinking and driving and because i was making my poor wife suffer but ever since a stopped about a week ago ive been super anxious and depressed i dont think its withdrawals because i didnt drink everyday and i would be able to go even two weeks without getting wasted i think its simply knowing that i can never get wasted again or even socially drink i was able to do that without getting wasted it fucking sucks and it honestly feels like i have a heavy heart as if i lost someone and i cant stop thinking about the fact that i cant drink anymore im feeling very depressed have any of you recovered alcoholics experienced what im feeling when they first stopped if so does it go away,post-pandemic
im a 19 year old college student who has anxiety depression and ocd i work as a server at a restaurant over breaks its my first job although i have done some paid research and the managers there are family friends about a year and a half ago i had a bad experience with a customer who was physically aggressive ever since then the idea of going to work fills me with dread ive also started getting anxiety attacks when im at work which are both terrifying and embarrassing im also miserable whenever im there because of how much baseline anxiety i have about work i hate the anxiety i feel at work but i really need money and ill likely have the same problem at other service jobs at the same time i dont know if i can keep doing this should i just deal with it for the next five or so years while im going to undergrad and grad school or should i try to find a different job even if i make less money are there other options that im just not seeing,post-pandemic
im just curious meds have helped me immensely ive never done the typical bipolar med resistant experiment of not taking them for a period of time that some of us do that being said i have noticed that lithium makes my brain feel foggy less alert i dont like it but the way i see it its a necessary evil so to speak also what meds are you on do they do the same thing,post-pandemic
i was raised by narc family members both my sister and my mom and when i look back at my childhood i was walking on egg shells as early as i can remember i know we were informed when we were diagnosed that bipolar is something youre born with but i dont believe that anymore i think environment plays a huge part in how these mental illnesses surface esp in our early 20s theres only so much stress a developing brain can handle and i now believe that if i grew up in a relatively normal household i wouldnt be having to deal with these mood swings and taking the pills im not complaining it is what is and you accept the cards youre dealt with but i always wondered what my life would be if i was never diagnosed lol,post-pandemic

i want to preface this with i feel horribly about it and was completely out of line i 24f took my toddler 3m old to sunday school without my husband 30m so he could have time without the toddler bc hes been with him the last two weeks nonstop due to being sick and not able to go to daycare till this week that went fine while we were gone i was going to stop at the bank to pull money out because were moving soon and surprise surprise no debit card so im trying to keep myself from melting down thinking its in my purse and ill look when i get to the atm well after sitting at the light through three cycles where the left lane was skipped i get to the bank and 1 cant find the card 2 the fucking atm isnt there cause i guess theyre closing that location so i called my husband to vent bc it feels like everything that can go wrong has been going wrong recently and i start spiraling on the phone and while trying to calm me down he mentions that its irritating that ive been spiraling since im not able to afford my meds rn insurance lapsed until march so i went off because he also hasnt worked since getting fired from his job in october and i was like i feel like im not getting any help financially because xyz company isnt returning your calls and you wont do any work besides x job which only leaves three options for you to work at and he started ranting and crying about how he was getting all the packing done while i had our kid out of the house which i had previously thanked him for and before being more or less incoherently upset so i fucking screamed at him thats its not about him its not his fault nothing is ever his fault and its my fault for fucking up and not doing enough constantly not gonna lie though i feel terrible but i wanted to say much more hurtful shit,post-pandemic

i and i guess a lot of other people on here am bad at upholding relationships i think that doesnt need much explaining i do however get into relationships very easily im not talking romantic relationships im talking any relationships at all and thats the problem while i can somewhat deal with people leaving my life with heartbreak and stuff like that i dont know what to do when im the one to leave the others life its rarer but it does happen its unexplainable it comes out of nowhere everythings going great we talk a lot i mean a lot and then i just idk its suddenly as if we were never friends i dont feel like answering their texts i dont feel like initiating conversations just out of the blue its frustrating because so far ive only had two reactions to that strong sadness and anger some will beg me to stay to tell them what they did wrong others will shout and tell everyone what an ass i am and how im selfish and only used them sometimes the person is first sad then becomes angry the thing is they generally didnt do anything wrong theyve been perfect to me i didnt want anything from them either at least consciously and i dont do that just to hurt them i dont want to make anyone sad nor do i want anyone going around thinking of how to get back on me ive tried everything im tired i dont want anyone in my life anymore because at the end its the same either im hurt or we both are each time i get out of a friendshiprelationship i swear to myself something along the lines of never ever get close to anyone nor let anyone get close to you then i go and start another friendship its never ending someone help or just say you relate i cant anymore why must i be human,post-pandemic

hi yall i dont know if this has been posted here before but i just came across by far the most comprehensive list of the physical symptoms of anxiety ive ever found you can find it at this link and then scroll down the page anchor links dont seem to be working right for me but just scroll and youll find the symptoms this apparently lists 241 unique symptoms of anxiety the next time youre thinking could anxiety really be causing this look here chances are yes my favorite thing about this is the quote from the very bottom of the page anxiety really can seem to cause almost every symptom imaginable because it does it mimics health conditions it can make you so sensitive to how you feel that normal perceptions feel abnormal it can create its own issues such as causing acid reflux which then causes hoarseness or chronic cough in nearly any mental health book the list of anxiety symptoms is extremely small and this leads to people developing even more anxiety as they worry that they may have something else that something else may be wrong with them but if you talk to people that have anxiety do research and learn more about the condition you will quickly find that there are hundreds of anxiety symptoms out there hope this helps someone out there edit i know this could possibly be construed as reinforcement for some folks but for me its a good firstdestination when i would google symptoms instead im going to bookmark this click on it find my symptom here and avoid the terrors of dr google,pre-pandemic

for context my dad gets me a grande cafe misto with almond milk and sf caramel 48 kcal and lovely pretty much every single day since its like my one source of comfort during the day the local drive through sbs has gotten it wrong on occasion leading to a lot of tears etc a few months ago he explained to the woman whilst waiting that i had pretty severe an hence why he always had to double check that everything was perfect otherwise it could be majorly upsetting for me she sympathised and said shed watched her sister start to slip into a potential restrictive disorder but thankfully she hasnt spiraled too far anyway now a few of the baristas know my order off by heart and why it has to be so specific he was waiting today while they brewed the filter and the person at the window explained they actually only let those specific people make my drink who know how why because they dont want to upset me and want to make sure its always correct he came home and had the above message written on my cup and it just really made my day it was really nice knowing how thoughtful they are and understanding sorry for the ramble i just have nobody to share this with and i found it really sweet x200b x200b edit thank you everyone i forwarded on the comments to my dad will also write to sb to name the branch hopefully theyll get some worthy praise 3 also my dad has been incredible he has aspergers but the lengths he goes to to empathize with me is something ill always be thankful for sadly weve both had to go through this disordered journey over the past year or so but hes very supportive as stated i forwarded on everyones compliments,pre-pandemic

my experience is that 90 of the people who act like they are all evolved about mental illness act like they are supportive understanding and caring will bail on you in a heartbeat when you are manic i have actually done this to others my last 2 doctors have fired me after a manic episode because they couldnt handle me when i needed help the most even my wife i gotta admit i dont blame them its just a shitty dynamic for me anyone else but there were a few who ran toward me when i was suffering i thank god for them bill jill,pre-pandemic

we all know that health anxiety strikes when we are already anxious it often serves as a twisted escape mechanism so we can avoid facing difficult situations or decisions after all how can i worry about that stressful situation with schoolworkfamilyfriendsetc when im focused on selfdiagnosing my mystery disease we often poke and prod and stare at ourselves in the mirror searching for things to get anxious over because we are consciously or subconsciously avoiding a bigger and more real situation stay busy stay selfaware hold yourself accountable for addressing stressful situations in your life rather than burying your head in the sand and diverting your whole focus to your ha hold yourself accountable to stop googling stop symptom searching stop reassurance seeking hold yourself accountable to take care of yourself because you arent going to be healthy if you dont put in the effort keep yourself healthy my ha has been flaring up this week ive been anxious about dvt you know what else is going on in my life stress at work stress from driving in snowice a stressful job hunt stressful upcoming exams on top of all of that i havent been diligent about taking care of my mental health ive slacked on my selfcare hygiene routine of meditation and yoga its a recipe for a ha flareup and instead of continuing to hyperfocus on the tiny possibility of my slight leg pains being something catastrophic im going to make the conscious decision to get back to focusing on myself and my future and the things that matter i will not give in to the temptation to put my difficult decisions on the back burner so i can obsess about something that isnt even real,pre-pandemic

i went to a club with my spouse last night i got to dress full fem and looked almost passing but thats a whole other line of information it was emo prom at arcade the music was so loud you couldnt really talk to anyone and people were hitting weed pens when it was illegal we had driven over the michigan border into indiana usa nothing against weed i use it occasionally i just avoid tempting to add to a spotless police record a lot of people looked really pretty and i brought my newly made and ordered introductory business cards that told people about some of my interests and that i was autistic it was too loud to talk to anyone unless you got right into their ear so that was probably a nogo to a bunch of strangers kind of impossible to figure out what anyone was in to except the amazing dj and the early to mid 2000s emo music my spouse thanked me as this was both of our first outings in many many years she said i did very good with not panicking and i am proud of myself for being around 100 people in a loud environment though i am absolutely exhausted we did some self reflection on the night and i explained how sometimes i wish i was neurotypical i was bored not because the environment was necessarily bad but because 3 hours of just listening to music so loud i cant hold a normal conversation isnt particularly mentally stimulating so i come to the actual question how do you all here try to meet new people i love to listen to people info dump as knowledge gathering is my entire purpose for living half joke i have other reasons but i absolutely love to learn about everything the club is nice but even trying to find someone else to sleep with my spouse and i are into that thats a whole other divergent subject but i perfer having a bond and trusting someone so maybe packed clubs are something ill just have to accept wont be for me and try to shake that feeling of fomo that im just not like other people when i say how do you meet new people this can be in person or online i have been trying to chat more in autistic focused discords so thats a start thanks for reading all of that if you did stay safe ily,post-pandemic

i have a new friend who knows about my ed not really the extent of it just that i have a restrictive one and every time we hang out they want to get something to eat of course i never discourage them from this i even pay for the food most of the time but it seriously makes me spiral i have to plan weeks in advance before we hang out because i know the week afterward i will be in a bad state i have safe foods at home that i am much more comfortable eating i usually time my meals and fast to specific times and i also hate eating around people but i put up with it for their sake i also feel like it would be rude of me to not join in when they get food honestly i dont have very many friends because of this if i say im not hungry they get frustrated with me and say we should eat anyway because they are but after having an ed this long i am not really hungry that often and i would really prefer just eating planned foods at home i hate picking something spur of the moment any advice similar experiences or help,post-pandemic
its the most frustrating thing in the world you tell someone about what symptoms your experiencing and they laugh it off or call you a hypochondriac yeah buddy i fucking know that i often ask people instead of google about whats wrong with me because id get better reassurance off of them but its always the same ignorance i wish everybody that didnt have health anxiety would understand how mentally draining it is and how real the physics manifestations can be my parents took it upon themselves to not allow me to go to therapy due to me being silly and it being something i have to get over and fix myself ive had this anxiety for over two months now and im currently on holidays this weeks special vertigo headaches and weakness i hate this so much i just wish i had someone to talk to that understands,pre-pandemic

i have issues like excessively sweating and my cognition being slightly impaired during my driving lessons i take critical feedback very badly and i already failed my test once i had aced the test multiple times during my trials during my test day i had a lot of panic attacks due to the number of people in the test and the hierarchical setting of it with test officers and all i also had a minor accident during my driving lessons which led to someone being injured that i think plays in my mind too this feels like the most difficult thing for me i am good otherwise at learning and picking things where there is not much of social scrutiny anyone in a similar situation and has any tips,post-pandemic

was told this by my therapist who is also a trauma specialist finally opened up to her about an event a couple years ago thats still been affecting me not officially diagnosed but she sent me a ptsd questionnaire thing to take when i left idk i knew i probably had trauma of some sort but i kept telling myself it wasnt severe enough to be ptsd but when i was taking the questionnaire i would read the questions and be like oh thats why ive been feeling that way so many things are connected to this that i didnt even realize im scared but im also a little proud of myself because ive been seeing this therapist for multiple years and just now finally mustered up the courage to tell her about this,post-pandemic

they say looks dont matter but unfortunately that isnt true for some of us the amount of grooming styling and exercising we do just cant fix bad genes while adults may not judge someone on face value if they are unattractive being made fun of as a kid leads to a chain of effects get made fun for appearance as a kidteen dont have anyone to hang with shattered confidence staying home on weekends and not talking much during school not developing social skills being socially inept as an adult most of my quirks are in my bone structure so it would take some serious plastic surgery to address them im so angry at myself for skipping on an opportunity to fix a very big flaw with my appearance 5 years ago because some yesmen convinced me i was okay im not,pre-pandemic
i dont think this falls under medical advice so im going to ask this question here my ast and alt levels came back high during my last blood test and im certain that its due to my alcohol intake so now my doctor wants me to take some more tests to rule out the other factors that could attribute to the results my question is should i be completely honest with my doctor about my drinking just so we dont have to take any unnecessary steps my main reason for asking this is that ive heard of stories where people who apply for life insurance are denied because of a history of drug or alcohol abuse they had many years earlier of course i understand that being honest will be the most beneficial to me now and to best help the process along im just curious if anyone here has dealt with medical records coming back to bite them later in life for any reason x200b x200b x200b,post-pandemic

tldr at the bottom about 1011 months ago i went cold turkey off of xanax i am currently 20 years old 62 180 lbs and still living at home i was taking roughly 712 bars a day and i lost the memory of a huge chunk of my life during the infancy of my sobriety i was going insane and my body felt like it was killing itself i lost a ridiculous amount of weight and i looked like i just walked out of a concentration camp i was so skinny and bony i destroyed a lot of relationships and friendships through my addiction and usage i even got into a car accident that could have killed 3 small children in the back and i was kicked out of my home for a few nights though cold turkey wasnt the best way of going about things my father denied me access to a doctor to get medical help for sobering up as time progressed i was still working 40 hours a week and still occasionally smoking weed fast forward today im at a healthy weight and clear mind today was like any other day off work mowing the grass making plans with friends but i was in need of an electric razor and i knew my dad had one in his bathroom so i go and search the drawers and when i look in the last drawer i see it not the razor but a prescription bottle of pearly white xanax bars my father must have stashed them there when i got caught before i got sober my heart stopped my mouth got watery and i began to sweat im almost a year sober and havent seen a xanax bar since and now im faced with 50 of them just sitting there in my reach i had no idea what to do but my addiction demanded i take half a bar just to get that high back and remember what it was like to feel blissful and at rest but i came too far i sat there and stared at the bottle and even held some of the bars in my hand but i knew this abusive relationship had to be over with once and for all so i took the bottle walked to my bathroom and popped the cap then i held it over the toilet and slowly tipped it and watched each bar drop into the water then i flushed it and they were gone and today i have made the hardest choice an addict will come face to face with and i succeeded in establishing the fact that i want to be sober and i want to be better this story isnt just for me to boast its a story that shows any one of you have the will power to break the chain around your throats and be free of addiction whatever it may be i believed in myself and i believe in all of you tldr found a bottle of xanax after ive been sober from them for almost a year and flushed them down a toilet and cried,pre-pandemic

my wife and i are both alcoholics in our early 40s one daughter 5 both work 37hrs per week we both drink vodka and diet soda usually half a litre each a day so at 1875 per bottle its an expensive habit wine and beer as well were both runners so would be healthy of it werent for booze addiction i have terrible psoriasis on my scalp and other parts we both suffer abdominal bloating which gets better if we abstain but we rarely do both have depression and we think the booze helps but it doesnt stopped for 4 days straight a few times in 2019 but couldnt do it enough im done im stopping as of now hoping if i can do it my wife will follow me its hard to stop when i know theres booze in the house what else oh yeah this post is part of my commitment to getting me and my wifes life back on track thanks for reading,pre-pandemic
experienced a rough event thats left me feeling crazy back in november of 2021 i was hit with a laced joint we think it was synthetic marijuana which resulted in me falling hitting my head and knocking myself unconscious i spent 18 hours in the er i have a large gap of time missing surrounding the event and my memory for the following two months is extremely shoddy i have flash backs to that night often its just that one night thats it nothing else happening in my life would suggest mental illness ive spoken with doctors and theyve diagnosed me with ptsd depression and anxiety three doctors so far all with a ptsd diagnosis i have flashbacks to law enforcement harming me threatening me they have a detective that i call when things get really bad he walks me thru the interaction what they have on paper in an internal report sometimes i feel better sometimes i think hes lying again this is strictly related to that one night i dont have flashbacks regarding anything but this event i can see what i think happened i can hear the conversations in the flashbacks it never changes its always the same thing i write it down when i have these flashbacks out of fear that it is going to change it hasnt the police department keeps telling me it was likely synthetic marijuana or bath salts that may have been in a joint i took a hit off of im having a really difficult time getting better because i have these extremely realistic memories is it normal for someone to experience a traumatic event and lose memory of it and is it normal for your mind to fill in the gap the way that my mind has,post-pandemic

you dont have to know it all after 3 months with health anxiety i can safely say that the mind is a powerful tool that is able to connect the dots with what you have read online regarding symptoms perhaps it is time to stop partaking from the fruit of knowledge of good and evil be kind to your own soul,post-pandemic

i have a dog that isnt a support dog but just makes me feel calmer even if i get overstimulated theres something about stroking her fur that makes me feel better some people at the college i go to say that it isnt autistic to love dogs im not sure how they meant it but as they are normally not nice to me i think they meant it rudely this confuses me how can something be not autistic i love my dog and animals in general they never ask questions they dont shout and they are always there taking my dog for a walk is probably the only time i get out of the house apart from college but how is loving dogs not autistic also what does it mean when people call you acoustic i know some autistic people like it but it confuses me,post-pandemic

triggered by person existing this headline sounds dramatic but need advice to deal with how to not be triggered when theres nothing to get triggered by i have a complicated relationship with my housemate they are my best and closest friend but things have been really good lately and in general things are very harmonious however i notice myself usually feeling very anxious andor depressed in their presence i am away this weekend and had a wonderful morning i was feeling completely relaxed and happy but then i get a phone call from them and my nervous system went into overdrive they were slightly more stressed than the mood i was in but they sounded happy and asked a simple question and the phone call was over within two minutes yet i am left feeling very anxious and my mood significantly worse i am looking if anyone has any tools to not be so affected over nothing or someone that has any idea why this might be so triggering any help exercises or analysis is appreciated thank you all have a blessed day,post-pandemic
i guess that is why people generally find my advice much helpful they are able to execute the instructions ive given them properly and benefit from it but when it comes to executing plans ive made for myself i just never seem to get it right or rather i shouid say that i never seem to get started edit thank you kind strangers for the gold silver ive noticed that some people are saying that they are not good planners and that they execute best at the last minute i find that relatable even though i think of myself as a good planner the most productive and noteworthy things ive been able to accomplish were all unplanned and kinda pushed on me i think all adhd people live by the motto if tomorrow isnt the due date today isnt the do date reading comments from you all makes me think that i am reading about myself just on different days of the week i can literally relate to everything you all are saying this kinda makes me feel that we are all in this together and we will get through it all i always second doubt my own ideas and generally question my ability to lead a normal life but listening to you all gives me much hope you all deserve all the loves and hugs in the world thank you for being so supportive,pre-pandemic

hi i just got diagnosed with ptsd on monday after having been diagnosed with and taking medication for bipolar 2 for the past 2 years i dont know how to feel i am smart enough to know that ptsd does not only pertain to people who have been through like war or unimaginable harm like that but still that is what i think about when i think about ptsd i have been sorting through all my memories and experiences and the resultant behaviors i have adopted because of them and it is starting to add up it is starting to add up that my parents the people who are meant to love me most beating me until i was bruised with a belt or a cane multiple times for simple things like breaking a dish was not normal i would stand there sobbing and they would yell at me tell me that if i made another sound they would beat me more sometimes they had me get the belt or the cane myself i was so young like between the ages of 5 and 11 i have taught these ages and i could not even imagine anyone hurting my students like this god i would cry silent cries so many times all by myself its starting to make sense that the way my heart would cease when they would come back home from work how i always knew they would have something to yell at me about was not normal it is starting to make sense that being called an attention seeker or downright ignored whenever i was sad and so obviously depressed was not normal god it makes sense that i dont remember ever being happy as a child it makes sense that when i told my mother she hurt me all she did was cry until i had to comfort her it makes sense that it was not normal that whenever i had an asthma attack she would yell at me for not taking better care of myself while i stayed there struggling to breathe it was not normal that no one told me that my god mother died when i as 16 even though i knew she was the only one that loved me truly she was my escape and my parents never made any space for me to cry to be held through it i still have not grieved her because i still dont know what happend to her this is the same with everything there was no room to be emotional and now i carry everything in my chest in my throat in the fact that i cant sleep at night all i wanted as a child was to be loved out loud to be considered and it is not normal that every time i tried to connect i was beaten yelled at or otherwise punished or ignored it is not normal that as a young queer person in an african country i was exposed to rhetoric about my life not meaning anything even if no one knew about me how now i believe that i will never be deserving of love ive never said this anywhere else but it is starting to make sense that it is not normal that my parents would engage in sexual acts with me in the same room or on the same bed how violated it made me feel in what was supposed to be my home how at 24 i cannot fathom being intimate with anyone especially having been sexually harassed while i was drunk by a friend my freshman year of college there are so many more examples so many things i cannot remember but my therapist has made me understand that i still feel them in my body in my throat my chest i always just thought i was anxious or manic or that it was grief all this time i have thrown myself into work i have distracted myself i have perfected my performance all this time all this pain i feel so sad and so alone and so scared of what it would mean for me to confront the fact that no one protected me as a child no one loved me in a way that i understand and no sacrifice is not love and so many people harmed me what would it mean for this to be true in a world post my mothers death when i was a freshman i dont know what to do i am so scared and so alone how am i supposed to reckon with and heal from everything what if i cannot do it and i am broken forever my therapist is incredible she tells me that just because i survived does not mean it was not trauma she tells me that it is okay for me to not be okay i dont know if i can make our sessions meaningful what if i cant say all the things that i remember someone please help me i am so scared,post-pandemic

it really irritates me that the word trigger or triggered has been turned into a joke and a meme and people just casually throw it around whenever something is mildly inconvenient then when i try to explain to people what my triggers are they treat it as if im just being overdramatic because of the contexts in which they normally see the word it makes me feel selfconscious about asking someone not to do something because its triggering since i worry that people who dont know what i have been through will assume im just an overly sensitive person who needs to get over it,pre-pandemic
im a university student f and i think that my biggest setback when it comes to social interaction is the idea that if i do anything that might bother someone elsecauses them to feel slighted in some way then theyll target me and try to bully me implicitly in any way that they can especially if we have classes together this happened a few times in school i was a good student back then but didnt interact much with my classmates so without me doing anything towards them they would try to hurt meoneup me or generally make me feel cornered at times and even if its not direct bullying i grew terrified of the pressure that always seemed to be looming when i was in the same roomclass as them logically i know i shouldnt care so what if they dont like me so what if they try to bump shoulders on the way out or do something petty like that i know i should defend myself if needed or ignore them but im petrified of making others angry of constantly feeling watched and judged even if it doesnt exist and i want to just get over it i want to get over this desperate need to have everyone either like me or not notice i exist just to avoid peoples judgement any advicemindsets i could adopt thank you so much,post-pandemic
does anyone experience this too when i am about to socialize i tear up whenever i feel selfconscious i tear up whenever i know or think im about to talk to someone i tear up when i say something cringy and realize that i tear up when i then after that i feel selfconscious about my eyes tearing up and then i tear up more its not even a sad tearing of my eyes they just start tearing up and its gotta be so fucking embarrassing just thinking of the people i talk to thinking is he about to cry why are his eyes tearing up i just wish i had a different way of acting up like blushing or sweating this eye thing is so debilitating to my ability to speak to people especially girls this is another topic for another subreddit but i am super selfconscious around girls because for some reason i care if they think im attractive or not whenever i think of how i look when im talking to girls i think of my insecurities and tear up then i think of what the girl thinks of me when i am crying all of a sudden while talking to them anyways excuse the little rant does anyone else have this and please how do i get rid of this or manage it,post-pandemic
first of all hi my name is dan and id suffered from ocd for 18 years which turned into health anxiety 5 years ago today i will tell you my story how it began how it climaxed and most importantly how it became a tool for me to live a more authentic life when i was around 8 years old i liked playing pokmon not liked loved my little monsters were everything the quality of my days were dictated by how much progress i made in the game if i was able to catch something new there was a twist to all of this however at that time it was not uncommon for cartridges to stop working suddenly that haunted me i was obsessed with the idea of it to stop working and losing everything i discovered that after many years what i just told you was the beginning of my ocd it expressed itself in many different ways and despite it being strong or weak it never took the bright from living it was until one day i looked in the mirror and saw a weird looking mole with a blackhead in the middle after debating with myself i went ahead and popped it what if it was c word i struggled with this thought for a couple of hours then it went away a year later i had some weird results on my blood work the number the idea of having something wrong with me my head was insane chaos i was desperate for an answer which i found but it was too late there was then always something new slowly it became worse and worse it stopped being something periodical and became constant for 6 months my life was nothing but an insane obsession with 0001s i was not able to live properly i had no appetite and only thought about having a concussion or an autoimmune disease half of my day was spend on the ha subreddit venting about my fears this is when i drew the line i needed to do something i started bringing this topic into my psychoanalysis sessions and doing erp on the side since its not supported by the type of therapy i was doing it was hard h a r d in both schools of thought treatment i dislike this word is not meant to be intuitive or fun in fact many psychiatrists say that erp is the hardest therapy to do i will now share what helped what i learned with psychoanalysis my health anxiety as well as my ocd was a way of my unconscious mind to express an excessive desire of perfection as well as the belief of its existence me and my therapist called it the circle no sharp edges smooth life however is not like that it might be circular but also have some bumps and sharp turns i believed that i needed this perfect life to be happy and looked for it through these symbolical obsessions why did i have this desire my parents hardly gave me limits which created in me a neverending desire for more this was called a core fear often talked about in cbt our health anxiety is hardly ever a symptom of being afraid of truly being ill but a fear of something rooted deep down what i learned with philosophy i started studying philosophy and one philosopher in particular caught my eye friedrich nietzsche it is not possible to explain his school of thought properly here it would take more than 10 pages but one specific mindset if you could call it that helped me we as humans refuse to live life how it is we create conflicts nonsensical morals nonexisting relationships we hardly ever truly live we are afraid of accepting the melancholy of life in its purest form however by being defensive about it we also do not allow ourselves to taste its color what does he say that we should do affirm life be ready willing and happy to suffer to have the most intense illness and understand that it is the nature of life be willing to suffer and to die i started doing safe unsafe things on purpose like for ex going for a road trip jumping with a parachute or traveling to a country with no great medical care in addition avoiding perfection in everyday life also helped what i learned with erp erp or exposure response therapy is meant to expose you to your fear in order to desensitize you from it sounds easy in practice but for us anxiety sufferers it is more difficult the processes is not as straight forward as for a focused phobia for example how do we expose ourselves if we have ha 1 do not google check your lymph nodes do not avoid the doctor etc why because if you dont you expose yourself to uncertainty you might only be able to do 1 and thats ok do 1 every day eventually you will be able to do 2 then 5 then 10 it gets easier 2 do not problem solve in your head this is a type of compulsion that we do that tries again to take us away from uncerainty look for uncertainty do not accept it affirm it my view nowadays is vastly different i see life now as an experience that has no guarantees and thats the nature of it if life brings me pain illness distress thats okay because thats what life is i know it sounds pessimistic but its the complete opposite you live more authentically i now cherish the present moment i feel like i woke up and every day is meaningful in its own way weirdly enough i thank my ocd and ha if it werent them i wouldnt be sensitive to living a lie and would experience just proxies of my desire without retaliation from my mind hope you all have a wonderful day recovery is possible and we have the opportunity to learn along the way sending love you can do it,post-pandemic
hi ive been diagnosed with complex ptsd and one thing ive noticed is its hard for me to make eye contact when talking to people i just look down last week i had my independent medical examination i dont think it went well i couldnt even make eye contact with the physiatrist my body was looking in a different direction just wondering if this is happening to others too and how you deal with it,post-pandemic
i had another episode last night where i tried to kill myself this one was pretty serious i attribute this to going off my meds over the past couple weeks i had been stable over the past month so i mistakenly thought i didnt need my meds anymore i titrated myself off of the meds carefully and didnt get any withdrawal symptoms so i thought i was totally fine unfortunately this past week was a steady decline in my mental health until it came to a head yesterday throughout the day yesterday i kept thinking that i was hearing police sirens and had bad paranoia that cops were coming to lock me up i felt like i was stuck in some alternate reality where i had to kill myself thankfully i ended up stopping myself before i died i hanged myself but the pain was unbearable and i called a friend she stayed overnight with me to make sure i was safe and didnt try anything again rest assured im back on my meds and will see my therapist and psychiatrist asap please please please do not go off your meds without a doctors approval it may seem like in the moment all is lost and death is the only option but its not its totally possible to bounce back and continue living a happy life,pre-pandemic

anyone who suffers from health anxiety what are your thoughts on increasing your own awareness of conditions you may be at higher risk of developing via certain tests for christmas i was gifted a 23me which has an ancestry and health component its such a cool gift but i have been sitting on doing it because i fear the health part of it might trigger my health anxiety further would you guys just do it and brace yourself for any potential mutations it may detect in you or would you wait until youve got a better hold of your health anxiety,post-pandemic

my friends during my health anxiety days i looked to map out my dying moments in different ways which kept me in a state of great tension and health anxiety prevailed its amazing how future thinking is more often than not coupled with catastrophic thinking for a health anxiety sufferer when in truth we can begin to give ourselves permission to be in the here and now we can begin thinking about our lives right now more than we think about the catastrophic future that may await us therefore take energy away from fear and give it back to safety please give this idea some reflection today you can do this dennis,post-pandemic

i 23f am american i dont know if it is just me but i am horrified by the thought of working all day every day until i can finally afford to retire if that ever happens my current job isnt hard but it sucks the life out of me every weekend is too short and every work week is too long i never feel like i am rested enough or that i have enough time to do the fun things i like to do i dont feel like i have hobbies anymore and i certainly dont have very many friends i feel like i have to spend all of my free time keeping my apartment together or resting to try and prepare for the following week i dont know how people do this for the majority of their lives and i especially dont know how people manage to do this while also raising children i think of all the things i want out of life including children traveling homeownership and everything else that comes with that and i dont see how it is possible for those things to happen working full time i dont even make enough money to do those things much less have the vacation time im working on budgeting and building my savings but the math never seems to work out in a way that feels comfortable i promised myself i would see europe before i hit 25 and i dont think thats a realistic goal anymore i get stuck in this spiral of am i just lazy and start to get worried that it is only me maybe somehow i am the only adult who cannot handle working full time and isnt happy about this being my life for the next 45 years sometimes i feel ungrateful my life is fine i have a roof over my head and food to eat i am privileged in terms of the type i work i do sure it is mind numbing and often anxietyinducing but it is a job that pays enough for me to stay alive thats better than a lot of people can say can someone tell me it isnt just me or maybe give me a reality check that it is i just dont know how i can keep this up for another 45 years im so tired edit ive taken some time to go through all the comments though i didnt expect so many and have really appreciated a lot of the advice ive been given its great to feel not as alone in this discomfort and i think i have some ideas and goals on how to improve my situation in this new year thank you all so much,pre-pandemic

hey all i need some advice tldr at the end my mom is 70 we live in apart of the world that has a very clich french wine culture as in wine is seen as normal with dinner even seen a weird without completely okay at lunch with colleagues etc my mom has always like her glass of red wine or two at night i never saw it as a problem but last year she did drynuary and some of the things she said worried me she mentioned how hard it was how much better she was sleeping how alert she was in the morning so after drynuary she decided to not drink on certain days fast forward to november 2023 and shes mentioning maybe not going on a trip for a bunch of reasons but also because its hard not to drink when im alone up there and that she hasnt had a day without alcohol in a while and she tells me she keeps track in her calendar this all raises alarm bells in my head so i tell her i want to do drynuary this year and i ask her if she wants to join me that it would be nice to do it together she agrees yay for me its a nonissue to not drink for the month it was interesting to see the social pressure and all but for her its the same as last year hard but lots of benefits now she started drinking again and wanted to only drink on weekends but it turns out that for her it is really hard when ive had a long day and i deserve a glass of wine all of this to ask how worried should i be my mom and i have an awesome relationship were really close but how can i keep the dialogue open and not ostracize or judge her when im really worried and what should i do or encourage her to do i also feel like at 70 maybe she has the right to have this coping mechanism tldr my mom drinks a glass of wine or two at night im worried about her mentioning how hard it is not to drink how do i take it from here,post-pandemic

i was in a relationship with my partner for about a year and our relationship ended in december of last year but its been dragging on back and forth the past couple months he broke up with me i suffer through extreme highs and lows and feel things very intensely i resonate with all bpd qualities but my psychiatrist wants to rule that diagnosis out because its a personality disorder says it like its a bad word but i feel im being misdiagnosed with bipolar disorder when i feel it is truly bpd i have severe abandonment and identity issues and my moods are constantly shifting i have felt like he was a god to me and then a total demon and the cycle would repeat i now know how bad i really have fucked up and i keep calling him and trying to reach out to him and even called his mom i almost went to his house but his mom said its not a good idea i dont know what to do i fucked up so bad and feel so shameful i really love him at heart and hes my best friend why is my brain the way that it is has anyone here been misdiagnosed with bipolar disorder or has both how do you cope with having bpd how do you manage having a healthy relationship hes never going to talk to me again i just want to get better how do i get better,post-pandemic

tw bulimia habits mentioned and triggering comments okay i know its my fault and i know i should communicate this at some point but i just wanted to vent so my boyfriend its been aware of my unhealthy relationship with food but i just opened about my undiagnosed bulimia a few weeks ago since then he talks about food much more than before he asks me if i got my meals what i eat etc and i get it i know he checks if im eating well and im glad hes taking care but its really uncomfortable and kinda humiliating i dont know he sometimes tells me some unhealthy habits with food not so in a ed way its more of a depression thing ig like oh im fasting since yesterday 10pm i have no energy bc i havent eat anything i dont know if i should go and buy food or just sleep and ignore i have to eat etc maybe those things arent as triggering for nondisordered people as they are for disordered people but at this point i just act like i dont care when people say im too lazy to eat i just say then dont back in the day when i was more private with and deep in my ed i was really caring about those things like please eat dont skip meals eating too much of junk food can be bad for you now that more people know about it it feels like a competition and i dont know why so now when my bf tells me those things i just say um okay or i just choose to respond the disordered response on purpose bc why would he choose to tell those things to the girl who its trying to not skip meals and eat without guilt again why he tells how he hasnt eated anything to the girl who struggles even eating fruit without purging it what is he expecting to hear from a person who had those habits and lived a literal hell when telling her that he is replicating them my brain cant help but feel so attacked for some reason that i dont care if im encouraging bad habits i dont care anymore if he is telling that to his sick girlfriend then he will receive her sick response so childish ik i dont want to talk about him about this bc i hate talking about my issues with food related things but i just feel so ashamed when this happens so probably i will do it if happens again,post-pandemic

ive been with my current partner for about two years now and theyve been a heavy drinker since long long before i knew them weve kind of always known that its a problem the severity of it waxes and wanes but its always been a bit of a background problem lately though their drinking has been getting worse and they brought it up with me telling me that theyre concerned by how much theyre drinking they went through a 175l bottle of vodka in a little over 2 days they want me to help them rein it in a little and i absolutely want to be as much of a support as i can but im not familiar with this sort of problem and i dont know how i can best be here for them we cant just have them stop drinking because theyll end up in the hospital if they do that its happened in the past before i knew them if they go without drinking for more than the better part of a day they start sweating and shaking violently i assume thats withdrawals anyway theyre physically dependent so just stopping isnt safe or reasonable for them my current plan of action is to figure out how much theyre drinking because without knowing that i have no idea how to even approach limiting their drinking or by how much i asked them to start keeping a notebook where each day they jot down a tally mark every time they have a shot so we can get a better picture of where exactly theyre at right now they dont know if theyre drinking 10 shots a night or 20 or more i ordered some stickers because i think theyll remember to use stickers better than tally marks their memory isnt great once i find out how much theyre drinking though then what how much do i limit them how slowly do i taper them down i work in pharmacy so i know about tapering when it comes to starting or stopping certain drugs im well aware that drastically reducing or increasing a dose of something be it alcohol or a drug can cause horrific and potentially fatal problems im just starting to do some research they only brought their concern up with me tonight but i wanted to ask people who have real experience dealing with this because i feel like you all might know much more about the right way to be doing this im encouraging them to talk to their doctor about this as soon as possible theyre going in for something else in the near future and im imploring them to ask their doctor for advice or seek counseling to help them in ways i cant i can do everything im capable of but im not a professional when it comes to this stuff we both know they need professional help and i think i can get them to at least mention it to their doctor and see what they say in the meantime though what can i be doing to be as helpful and supportive as possible what should i be doing while i wait for them to get professional help and what should i do after that i love them so much and all i want is for them to live a long happy healthy life ive always worried about their drinking because i know how hard it can be on the body when youre drinking as much as they are and i dont want them to die young theyre 29 but theyre already experiencing some health issues because of the drinking like insanely high blood pressure and severe memory issues but i never tried to push them because it wasnt really interfering with the rest of their life their drinking has never caused problems with their work nor have they ever acted out while drunk if theyre reaching out to me for help though then of course im going to do whatever i can anyway im rambling at this point id just appreciate any sort of advice from people who have gone through this thank you in advance for any insight,post-pandemic
autism diagnosis questions posting on behalf of my partner hello i am posting this on behalf of my partner as they are not on reddit too much has anyone else navigated feeling that their autism diagnosis is wrong they got it about a year ago but have consistently felt that it was not a good fit the clinicians didnt listen well to their experiences and seemed to interpret their lower questionnaire scores specifically the srs2 and the catq as poor personal insight they also scored on the cusp of the ados2 but it seems this was attributed to masking despite the lower masking scores their dad and one of their siblings is autistic which is part of why they got assessed they have been looking into the broader autism phenotype as well as subclinical autism is there anyone who can relateshare experiences i also ask that there is little criticism this process has already been difficult enough for them it has been a year since they were diagnosed and its still feels wrong for them despite going back for additional testing,post-pandemic
i wanted to post a story of hope for those of you still out there battling addiction every day tomorrow is valentines day and will mark my 12 years sober date from heroin and opiates on valentines day 2012 i woke up in a hospital from an overdose of heroin i was at the absolute lowest point in my life with little care if i lived to see another day or not jail at one point didnt sound too bad compared to the life i was living after i was revived i woke up to my parents standing over me and the look of horror and disappointment is something i will never forget i was given two options either go to detox and then residential care or they were done trying to help and wanted nothing to do with me my dad didnt want to help at all and had already completely written me off i decided to go to detox at a psychiatric hospital that had a very well known residential facility next door withdrawals were horrible the first three days i wanted to die then i was put on suboxone which is a whole other story on how i got clean i stayed in residential treatment for 45 days and promised myself i would do everything that they told me to do i went to 90 meetings in 90 days probably more just to keep myself busy after residential i lived in a halfway house next to the facility weirdly enough 10 years later from that point the guy who ran that halfway house would be apart of my life again after i started rehab and for about two years later from that point too i felt alienated from my family but i keep trying telling myself actions speak louder than words and they will either come around or they wont its out of my control i admitted i needed help and listened to people with long term sobriety on what to do every month making the decision to stay sober got a little easier even when things would get rough just deciding to stay sober during those hard times made it easier later on to impulsively stay sober i dropped all my using friends deleted all of my social media and started making new healthy friendships skip ahead 9 years later i go back to college i get my degree in human services on the substance abuse track a year after that i apply for my sacit substance abuse counselor in training credentials a few months after that i get approved during that process i was brought onto a treatment center as a substance abuse counselor we do outpatient intensive outpatient residential and pretty much everything else a treatment center offers i found out a couple weeks after getting the job that the guy who runs the agency i am at is the same guy who ran the halfway house at the rehab i originally got sober at he only had 3 year sober when i met him i have remained sober ever since and am still employed at the residential facility as a sac running groups with a caseload of 8 clients i see individually for an hour each per week i have been given a second opportunity to help people who i deeply understand and couldnt be more grateful now my dad is the one who calls me when he needs advice on his own anxiety my mom calls all the time for advice as well ive never been closer to my family than i am today something i thought 12 years ago would never be possible again i have learned to forgive myself for what i have done in the past i would like to tell you theres an easy way through recovery but there is not and i fully understand how much harder fentanyl is to get off than heroin my point of this post is to give the addict still suffering hope if you want it bad enough you can achieve absolutely anything you put your mind to im currently enrolled in school for my bachelors i have one more year before i have my bachelors in clinical psychology and two and a half more years before i have my masters in social work valentines day february 2012 was the day i thought my life was over but little did i know it was the day my life started back up if anyone needs someone to talk and read my storyrant feel free to message me i can give you resources and point you in the right direction 12step meetings werent for me i see their benefit but i did things differently recovery isnt a one size fits all type deal but taking the first step is mandatory to taking back control of your life thank you for making it this far you got this keep pushing,post-pandemic

i grew up quite overweight and most ppl including my mom and older sister specifically constantly criticized my body during the pandemic when i was extremely overweight a thought i had often was that i was going to become skinny as revenge towards both my mom and sister for constantly commenting on how unhealthy fat big i was always wanting them to feel bad for what they put me through recently i went home for the holidays and my entire family was concerned with how much weight i had lost although i was simply at the average weight for my height and frame yet i spent the next few weeks gaining about 10lbs higher end of normal bmi for my height in order to not worry my parents even though my family still thought i looked too skinny i came back to uni and now ive lost all that weight plus more im going home next weekend and im afraid to face my family my mom just called me and halfway through our conversation started telling me i have to eat and i think its because she feels guilty for my disorder i lied saying i do eat i honestly did good enough at it until i got back to uni yet she hasnt seen what i look like im too embarrassed for her to even see i feel guilty for her guilt,post-pandemic
saw a post earlier asking about the effects of glp1s on adhd and as i read through the comments and one really got me thinking about a personal issue i have been on 30mg of adderall xr for well over a year and up until two months ago i had no issues with sleep the only thing that changed around that time was i started mounjaro this really got me wondering if the stomach slowing aspect of the glp1 causes the adderall to take longer to get through my system sometimes i do feel the adderall works longer than 810 hours and if i skip a day the next night my sleep is better any thoughts similar experiences,post-pandemic

words cannot explain how good life feels without pills and hard drugs took 7 months to finally feel what its like to live a normal life i dont do anything more than weed nicotine and alcohol and im slowly quitting one of those at a time replaced it by moving to the rocky mountains and spend all my time snowboarding being sober feels better than any drug ive ever taken not even mentioning the mental health affects ive never been more happy and satisfied with life and i hope this provides motivation to even one person stopping hard drugs was the best decision ive ever made life gets better but it takes months to feel the affects so please hold out until then being sober off the hard stuff feels better than taking them trust me,post-pandemic

im 33 now but have really struggled with my drinking for over ten years now went to rehab once in my early 20s i was on benzosbooze back then my addiction and depression have yoyod throughout the years and came to another huge ugly head october of last year when i was hospitalized with alcoholic ketoacidosis for the first time two more hospitalizations would happen by beginning of december grateful to say i havent drank since the day of the last er trip so its been a little over two months now probably the longest ive gone without a drink in over a decade i do take naltrexone to help with cravings plus i take pristiq daily with my body and mind feeling less like sludge i even improved my diet and got back into the gym wednesday i had my first therapy session in a very long time and the next day my dad suddenly passed away a hell of a time for this right just when things were so much better and hopeful im an only child and the direct next of kin i still have not drank since getting the horrible news and making arrangements but im still worried about possibly slipping what if my willpower isnt as strong as i thought it was is a little over two months of sobriety and overall mindfulness of wellness and health enough to start a strong foundation at least sorry for rambling processing all of this plus i dont see many anecdotal alcoholic ketoacidosis posts or videos like on youtube so i wanted to open up a dialogue of anyone has questions about that part of this specifically eta even though he just passed away i already feel like i might be handling this better than i would have had i not started getting help when i did in december still some doubt in the whole willpower thing tho,post-pandemic

disclaimer im posting in this sub as i have adhd and wonder if theres a correlation rejection sensitivity is quite high as is getting hyper fixated on one topic etc are there any adhd dating tips im a 27f attractive and in shape basically i have zero relationship experience so much that i freeze up and dont know how to date genuinely in 27 years i have had zero real relationships as i had always been chasing some sort of goal or milestone and now im left in the dust im not gay trust me i tested it out i recently went on a date with a nice fella but genuinely hadnt dated in so long that i fucked it up and came across as a rude prude hoping for any and every sort of advice you have things that make you feel special heard seen what you expect on first dates should i offer to split conversation topics following up how long after do i text i have a bit of a fear of intimacy with strangers so im not someone who will bring someone home but i dont know how to communicate that im bad at online dating as in i dont know how to dont find small talk with strangers exciting how do i approach a guy i find attractive whats a good opening line how do i communicate i want to get to know someone rather than sleep with them immediately im lucky with initially having men approach me irl or apps because they are attracted to me but somehow i fuck it up and they think im either disinterested or i just get weird its a bit uncomfortable for me to take compliments as i genuinely think there is more to a person and so sometimes i just go quiet and awkward what is a better way to handle this appreciate anyone whos read this far all advice welcome,post-pandemic

its a long story and it was probably the longesthardest grind of my life but i tapered from 12 drinks a night to 2 drinks a night it was a steady decline over the course of 3 months so honestly im unsure if it even counts as a taper at that point but it is what it is and finally it worked it wasnt intentionally that slow every day id say tomorrow im cutting down by 2 but id only ever manage to cut it down by 2 after id been drinking a certain amount for a couple weeks i can wake up as soon as my alarm goes off shovel snow at 6am work a full time job while keeping up on all my household choresi consider myself to be a fairly disciplined person but ive sufficiently proven to myself that i cant taper not at the rate that its created for anyways i did a form of tapering kinda but it wasnt ideal anyway im curious to hear other stories the only way i could imagine a successful and ideal taper is with someone hovering over me to make sure i dont cheat,post-pandemic

i was trafficked as a childyoung adult obviously there were many people involved in this situation but there was one man that was mostly in charge i got news a couple of weeks ago that he died in prison everyone in my life feels like i should be happy or relieved about that but im not happy at all its really painful i feel like im in mourning over his death i keep having dreams about all of the nice things he did for me handing me a glass of water allowing me to sit on the couch after a particularly violent encounter giving me a blanket to sleep with when i was really sick i cant stop i literally catch my brain thinking that this dude loved me and im really sad that ill never be able to see him again which is probably the most fucked up thing ive ever thought in my life seriously this man killed my daughter and essentially ruined my life but my brain is somehow trying to convince me that he loved me it makes me nauseous that i could even think that but somehow it creeps back in ive told a couple people in my life about these feelings and everyone is like dude thats fucked up how i dont know how im crazy i dont know i guess i just wanted to share with some people who might understand i am hoping these weird feelings pass quickly and never come back jesus,pre-pandemic

tw alcoholic parents spoiler it does turn out to be a rant hi i hope this isnt going to turn out being a rant i just need to write some stuff down i know that alcoholism has some stereotypes and that it typically looks a certain way and we typically categorize the nonstereotypical other way as functioning alcoholism in that context both of my parents were functioning alcoholics both made me live hell on earth growing up and neither would admit that they were terribly addicted to the sweet feeling of relief whenever they sat down for the night for their drinks for my dad the last drink was whenever he couldnt hold himself together when he eventually got tired of cursing my mom out and went to bed to curse me out as it was my turn in his head for my mom it was getting blackout drunk every night i genuinely have no clue how she kept this up for so many years and how her body didnt collapse after a certain point im thankful theyre both fine but the memories theyve left behind are still scars that i carry eventually they got separated and my mom had a sleeve gastrectonomy operation a few years later leaving her unable to drink alcohol for a year i cant find words to explain how relieved i was to learn this and how anxious and scared i was because i didnt believe she could do it to my surprise she managed to stay completely sober for over 8 months it was the best 8 months of my life then her doctor told her that the one year rule was just a random amount of time he made up to make his patients quit bad addictions i love how he thought that would work i love how i thought things had changed we had an incident we went to a bring what youre going to drink event where my mom insisted on bringing a bottle of wine to accompany the few bottles of beer i was bringing for myself i filled her glasses carefully as a server in a luxury restaurant would she had been sober for a while and i didnt want her to experience what being drunk was like at this stage of her life we left early and she wanted to buy a bottle of whiskey from the store on our way back i was completely terrified i begged her not to i really did try to stop myself from begging but i couldnt relive the things i did i couldnt see her lose herself again we still live together for context and so after hiding the bottle she had bought for a short while i gave her the entirety i had considered pouring it down the drain and told her that i trusted her a few months later it was my birthday and my friend gifted me a small bottle of gin i kept it in the fridge until today 2 months later im not doing so well and wanted to make myself a small cocktail to make myself feel better to spoil myself the bottle was empty the 2 beers i had drunk prior to this moment evaporated from my body i was completely sobered up and in shock i genuinely could not believe she would do this to me again i know what that empty bottle means i know why she left it there for me to see i know what shes trying to do i know shes trying to hurt me because in some ways she feels like i hurt her as i said were living together and im 25 im unable to move out due to the housing crisis and am trying to save some money in the process shes aware that im extremely prone to panic attacks and have ocd behaviors especially related to my living space my therapist claims so she has never been respectful of my boundaries related to these two issues which are probably results of her functioning alcoholism to begin with i have tried to communicate my boundaries to her in a variety of ways guided by my therapist i know she left the bottle there to make me feel ashamed that i set boundaries with her i know her i know how her head works i just thought it was over i was so happy i do blame myself for her relapse and i blame myself for not being a better daughter to her i genuinely wish i didnt have to set any boundaries and would be okay with anything its so crazy how we think nighttime drinking is ok and therefore not categorized as alcoholism just because someone can stay sober for the day waiting for the sun to go down does not mean theyre not an alcoholic x200b,post-pandemic
26m hi all so ive recently got out of a 5 year relationship and moved back in with my parents and just when i thought things were getting better ive been having negative thoughts pop into my head ive now just been saving up money but for what a new car a new place to live to travel i dont really know to be honest im not really sure what to do anymore and thought coming here might be good for some advice,post-pandemic
my partner is a fairly closed off person and i am a bit awkward in finding my words which makes it difficult to approach the depression i know he has been facing i also think the stigma of being seen as a closed off person makes it more difficult for him to break the norm and open up every once in a while a conversation about it will open my heart hurts for him he is so hard on himself which leads to self sabotage which is just a vicious cycle he has expressed that he cant really feel happiness anymore he feels like he should be further along in life than he is hes been having late night panic attacks and he suffers through them alone instead of waking me hes a pretty old school masculine male so i think getting to the point of unpacking the things and emotions that have led to this state is going to be a real journey but entirely possible and he does have a support system who loves him if hell be open about talking and accepting help he does not want to see a dr or get on medication which i understand but is open to finding help in other places we are both heavy drinkers but we dont get stupid when we drink so its easy for us to brush off but i know its a problem and think that the long term affects of alcohol have messed with his dopamine as well i know who he is and i see him on a deep level for the kind caring generous and loving person that he is and all the surface and status crap doesnt mean anything to me i am looking for advice on the best way to support him and encourage healing and progress without overbearing or burning him out or making him feel like hes doing it for me what are little things i can saydoencourage to show him that i am a safe space and that he doesnt need to put on a show for me how can i help him get the help he deserves i wish he could see himself through my eyes and i wish i could just hug all the negative emotions away but i cant and i need a starting place for us to foster healing we are going to attend aa and try to find a community so he and i can talk to other people as well but id like some advice on what i can do on the home front to make sure he knows he is loved and appreciated and to try to help him love and appreciate himself,post-pandemic

ive been 12 days sober since i had an experience that scared me i was watching the patriots vs titans game at a bar alone because i couldnt get it to stream on my tv im a 29 year old female and i am fairly sociable i ended up making some new acquaintances and having several drinks with my new found fellow patriots fans i remember being at the 1st bar after the game and then things get really hazy i know i walked next door to the other bar and then the night is lost i have about 810 hours of unaccounted time i know there was another bar after that because of transactions on my bank card i have no receipt for an uber or lyft i woke up the next morning in my apartment with no memory of getting there with an opened condom wrapper on my night stand there was a condom in my trash can but it looked like it had been put on but not really used if you know what i mean physically it did not feel like i had intercourse in that blackout period i also woke up with a big bruise on my knee bloody knee cap and an extremely painful elbow meaning i had a pretty hard fall that i obviously dont remember the blackout i experienced was slightly terrifying and i know i am lucky because that stranger could have done whatever they wanted to me and i would have woken up with no idea who they were i still dont know who this guy was but im glad he made the decision to not completely take advantage of me this experience has motivated me to reevaluate my relationship with alcohol i work in sector of health care radiology where we are constantly treating people for horrible alcohol related pathology sorry if im ranting but its just good to get this out thanks for reading,pre-pandemic

i suffer from ptsd from mutiple different things in my life but one of the most intense and horrifying to remember is when i was homeless for a year in america at least though im sure in other places as well once you become homeless or in poverty youre no longer a part of society youre not a member of society youre a burden a leech for needing anything anything at all even something as small as a listening ear or breadcrumb its an offense to even suggest you may need help to suggest that anyone should even consider helping you because in their eyes you must have done something to deserve poverty or homeless its like a moral branding to them it doesnt matter how you became severely poorhomeless and it doesnt matter how desperately youre fighting to surviveescape your circumstances poorhomeless is all they need to know to know that youre unworthy of help or of compassion youre the scum beneath their feet youre not even human even after being homeless and tormented for a year and then in poverty for 4 i still feel myself become crushed under the weight of peoples disgust for poorhomeless people it utterly shocks me it steals the breath from my lungs the internet is full of cruelty and anger obviously but its not just on the internet anyways not by a longshot people are not shy about their disgust for poor people and if you havent been in extreme poverty you may not have even noticed how bad it is you may have some deeply rooted hatred and judgement inside you too its horrifying and it brings me back to the most horrifying daysexperiences of my life i think i had a conclusion to this but i feel like a child again starving and absolitely terrified and being proven to that even the mostly seemly compassionate or kind people will turn on you the moment you have no money the moment you become worthless heres a conclusion i guess anyone else traumatized by povertyhomelessness or more specifically how people treated you because you were in povertyhomeless,pre-pandemic

hi everyone i just had my 2nd child in november and i ended up developing severe postpartum preeclampsia i was on bp meds for 3 months and just got off of them last week as my bp has been normal i was always very symptomatic with my bp being high i would get a weird pressure feeling in my chest and head once my bp started to normalize and i realized i was still feeling the head pressure it started to freak me out i googled my symptoms and of course brain tumor was the first thing to come up i went full panic mode because my stepmom passed away from brain cancer i rushed to the er where they did a ct scan to rule out anything since i just had preeclampsia this was in december it came back clear im still having the head pressure and its really freaking me out guys like i cannot get myself to chill out some days are better than others but today has been really bad and usually this feeling sends me into a spiral that i cannot get myself out of without taking ativan im terrified of anxiety meds so i do not take them i am currently in therapy i saw an ent last week who diagnosed me with chronic sinus diease and hypertrophic adenoids im on a month long steroid nasal rinse as well as prednisone and im now on my third antibiotic since the culture she took from my nose came back as bacterial infection she reviewed my ct scan from december and said it was normal so idk how related this pressure feeling could be to the sinus disease i wish i could blame the pressure on it but since my ct scan was normal i dont think i can im just so afraid that this is something ill have to live with forever i hate this feeling so much and its like my body is constantly in fight or flight thinking there is something severely wrong i convinced myself that i am feeling a brain tumor developing or something else please help calm me down i really dont want to take ativan again i already had to yesterday idk what to do but i cant seem to pull myself together i also have a constant feeling of impending doom and that im going to die and leave my children behind im so afraid i dont want to feel like this anymore,post-pandemic
howdy i was diagnosed with severe combined type adhd as an adult around 23 im now 28 since i was first diagnosed i only took er methylphenidate dose increased from 9mg to 36mg over the years as part of the troubleshooting process methylphenidate worked well for me the only downside was i was a little sluggish by mid day but my doc addressed that by adding in a small ir dose in the summer of 2023 i couldnt get my concerta scripts filled to save my life i was going weeks without meds sometimes my doc theorized the adderall shortage could mean that more people were switching to concerta so he switched me to 20mg er and 10mg ir adderall here comes the complication im bipolar i thought i was bipolar 2 the less severe type adderall induced a severe monthslong manic episode that i didnt know i could have i didnt know what was happening or even that anything was wrong with me this episode caused a lot of damage in my life while it was happening and after i also have nightmarish anger issuesoutbursts that never occurred before taking adderall ive been on the adderall for 10 months now and i have a new psych who switched me back to concerta after explaining the whole terrible story ive wanted nothing more than to go back on my original meds but now that i have them im afraid to take them because i legitimately feel traumatized by my own brain has anyone experienced something like this have you ever switched meds only to switch back to your original does anyone have any words of advice or comfort i know the bipolar aspect complicates things but at the bottom of this is anxiety about switching meds i know a decent amount of folks prefer adderall but concerta was very kind to me tldr couldnt get concerta prescription filled got switched to adderall and it induced a bipolar manic episode im now prescribed concerta again but i feel like damaged goods super nervous to take my old meds again thanks,post-pandemic

its amazing how apple can buy beats by dre with its eyes closed but completely ignore the pleas of the autism parents the company relies on for its promotion of ipad as an assistive device yes you read that correctly apple completely ignores the parents of autistic children and in essence autistic children as well how so thats a pretty simple answer lets take a gander at apple support communities this is an online community that supposedly exists in order for apple users to not only correspond with other customers in order to gain valuable knowledge and resolve issues but also as a forum to air out concerns to apple in hopes of future enhancement thread 8031828 is a concerning one the main post created by mkmartel is titled how to limit volume in ipad ios 102 the user posted on august 4 2017 see user mkmartel is a lot like me a working parent with an autistic child my son was diagnosed at the age of two and is now a thriving tenyear old his best friend is an ipad parents of autistic parents all invest hardearned dollars into ipads because of the marketing behind the devices being assistive to those with special needs one problem volume limit perhaps apple needs to hire a special needs adviser to the staff maybe parttime maybe just a temp see autistic children have the tendency to crank the volume up to the highest level no matter what its part of the inherent sensory issues those under the autism spectrum have this may not seem like a big deal to those parents with typical children but this can be quite disturbing and nerveracking on a continuous basis below is the entirety from the main poster mkmarkel my son has autism and loves to watch videos on ipad however he loves turning the volume all the way up no matter how much i turn it down or ask him to turn it down there is no reasoning with him on this the second i turn my head he turns it all the way up and it drives me crazy ive gone to the restrictions part of settings and enabled the do not allow changes part of the volume limit but that didnt do anything the volume can still be changed very easily you cant tell me after all these years apple doesnt have a way to set a max volume on a device amen mkmarkel amen the ipad has a volume limit that only limits music when headphones are on but when headphones are not in the equation all bets are off can you imagine how unnerving an ipad can be at full blast during a movie when just waking in the morning or a public library are you telling me the super geek brainiacs at apple cannot write the code for a setting that limits the volume on ipads i think apple has made way bigger strides dont you check out the rest of the pleas from parents of autistic children on the same page completely ignored by apple its been 18 months and counting since the initial post 10117this could have been written by me and is the bane of my life apple please sort this out if anyone ever finds out if the volume can be limited please post here as i cant get it to work on my sons ipad mumania 11418as a mom to twin boys with developmental delay and adhd the volume level and ensuing meltdowns are maddening after research the volume limit controls and restrictions only apply to the headphones when in use major bummer mazda3s 32418i could have written that word for word my autistic son keeps turning the volume all the way up as well apple please fix this appleieverything 32918i will never understand how they can market this as an assistive device and not fix this issue weve all been complaining about since the first generation the volume fights are ridiculous how is this still an issue we never use music and videos or tv as its called in the current iteration doesnt apply the music volume limit so frustratingeisnikki from the parent of an autistic child thank you apple for caring about us whats your workaround buy beats headphones,pre-pandemic

i made the switch from venlafaxine effector to fluoxetine prozac a couple of weeks ago first of all that was awful but im hoping i through the worst of the withdrawal symptoms i was on 225mg of venlafaxine and gp got me to stop that dead and start 20mg fluoxetine now i am wondering should i try taking no medication for a while one of the big issues i have with my anxiety is to do with ibs like symptoms ive been in anxiety medication since i was 2021 and im almost 32 now i am seeing a psychologist to work through my mental health challenges so perhaps it would be worth seeing what it is like if i dont take anything for a while give my body and mind a chance to reset without any interference from medicaiton and chemicals i of course will discuss this with my gp and psychologist but it is always helpful to hear of other peoples experiences also at the moment im finding my colon rectal area all feels inflamed and i get occasional pangs that feel like their in my intestines im wondering if this is to do with the serotonin receptors in the bowels so again an adjustment period ive started to take a cheaper version of benadryl as some people have said that helps with withdrawal from venlafaxine etc i cant always do a lot of caffeine but ive found my insides are super sensitive to it at the moment perhaps because things are inflamed anyhow thank you for your time also if youd like to support my creative endeavours please follow my instagram account artbycorrine i have started to base my artwork around my struggles with mental health and support from those with similar difficulties would mean the world to me i put some of my artwork up so you can see what its about thanks again,post-pandemic

what was the thing that made you go okay this isnt real for me i had been diagnosed as bipolar 1 and on medication for three months but i still believed that all the cars around me were following me and reporting what i was doing i thought the license plate numbers were signs and that this is how they were trying to communicate with me i would add up the numbers and they would always tell me something one day i went for a drive to the ocean and as i was driving there the numbers on the license plates werent translating to any signs they just looked like random numbers suddenly i got the thought of what if the cars arent sending me signs but if that were true that would also mean that my phone wasnt hacked and there wasnt a movie being made about me i thought my phone was hacked by them and i would write notes to them and when my phone would autocorrect i thought that was them replying back to me anyways after i had that thought in the car about the plates i started typing in my phone asking them if this was real or not and as i did that my autocorrect jumped in and changed some of the words and then i realized the words that it was changing to were words close to the letters i had been meaning to type so it was just autocorrect aaanddd thats when my delusions all fully broke i finally had proof through the autocorrect i kept looking at the car plates and again they just looked like random numbers i cant believe i thought they were signs and people following me for a year but yeah just curious how the rest of you came out of your delusions when they broke i felt a lot better after because i no longer felt like i was being watched and stalked it was a big relief but i still cant believe i thought that was real,post-pandemic
hey everyone im doing a lot better than when i started i saw someone a few months ago lament that those who recover leave the subreddit so we never learn how to get better i promised that when i recovered id try to contribute so here is my attempt many of us have likely searched for can anxiety cause x y or z in an attempt to comfort ourselves that our symptoms are mental not physical so i am providing a list of physical symptoms anxiety has caused me with most of these i have sought medical help with all of these enough time has based that it is surely not cancer strokes terrible infectious disease or some awful thing causing it thus anxiety or some benign spurious cause is the most likely culprit perhaps others could comment with their physical symptoms as well 1 head aches 2 really bad head aches 3 pressure in my head as if i were underwater or in an airplane 4 tingling on the side of my head on my face fingers and toes 5 a bizarre tingling sensation crawling down my face 6 both arms legs and my face feeling like they are falling asleep simultaneously 7 feelings of being disconnected with reality 8 certainty that some terrible healthrelated catastrophe will strike me within seconds 9 dizziness 10 intense vertigo lasting up to eight hours per day 11 heart palpitations 12 chest pains 13 blurring throbbing peripheral vision 14 random tingling almost numbish spots 15 tingling sensations shooting down my arms when i move them 16 waking up with my arms legs eyeballs and tongue moving rhythmically 17 symptoms resembling a urinary tract infection decrease strength of urine stream increased frequency of urination pain in the bladder area bladder feeling more full relative to how much i urinate with a clean urinalysis and urine culture 18 stomach pains diarrhea and also gastrointestinal symptoms 19 extreme discomfort and feelings of sensoryoverload with light and sound 20 dozing off then snapping back into reality forgetting what had happened 21 forgetfulness including of recent events how did that get there 22 thinking it is the wrong year 23 difficulty falling asleep 24 difficulty waking up 25 exhaustion 26 scary things happening while i work out making me think im having a stroke heart problems or something wrong with my head 27 mood changes 28 depression 29 muscle cramps 30 sexual dysfunction 31 weight loss even when taking a break from diet and exercise im not telling anyone not to get things checked out but as my neurologist told me anxiety can mimic virtually anything physically i also want people to know that i am doing really well right now despite having very crippling extreme health anxiety in the past prayer therapy and medication have helped me recover a lot i am even weaning off one of my medications now in the past i was able to wean off everything and stayed healthy for years im currently recovering from a relapse let me know if you have any questions ive been incredibly blessed by this subreddit and would count it a personal blessing to pay it forward and help those who went through went i went through i dont consider myself a very strong person so i really think if i can get through it you can too,pre-pandemic

hes only 28 at age 25 he told me he had liver cirrhosis but i think hes been downplaying everything when i ask him how its doing he says he gets it looked at every 6 months and that it hasnt grown he tells me its fine and he eats healthy now hes been admitted to rehab by the military which tells me his heavy drinking is affecting his professional life now hes only in treatment for 28 days and i feel like he needs longer time and more extensive care than that i want him to recover and get better but i know thats something he will have to realize and do on his own he says he doesnt need to be in rehab and that most of the guys there are depressed suicidal or anxious i saw him today for the first time in years he had a red blood spot on his eyeball and bruises on his face he says its from the seizures hes had called delirium tremens he says hes doing great and hasnt had any withdrawl symptoms ive personally witnessed him drink a 1 liter bottle of vodka in half a day when he was 22 ive seen him chug 3 amfs in one sitting he ordered one for home for myself and my sister and me and her barely drank ours so he didnt want to waste alcohol and drank it for us after a night out of heavy drinking ive seen him drink 2 beers first thing in the morning with breakfast he thinks hes invincible i tell him to be mindful of his health and his response is that he can buy health i wanted to tell him you cant buy immortality but i know itll be met with pushback we have a recovered alcoholic father his father was an alcoholic and died from cancer related to his drinking our moms dad also died from liver failure due to heavy drinking so theres definitely a genetic component to it my dads twin is also a recovered alcoholic of over 10 years my brother told me not to tell anyone about the liver cirrhosis but i confided in my uncle for guidance hes a facilitator for his aa program and helps guys who are new to aa and he told me not to confront him about any of it i know from dealing with my dads past drinking that you cant confront an alcoholic and that they have to want to heal on their own my brother is too young and has his whole life ahead of him he is a brilliant compassionate person with a big heart it hurts me to see him like this and i hope he can turn his life around before its too late our parents dont know hes in rehab or even back in the states hes been stationed overseas for the past 5 years and im the only person hes told i think the reason hes confided in me about all of this is because i dont overworry or blow things out of proportion like my parents do but this has really got me worried i dont want to over exaggerate but i think this is really serious and i want to help i just dont know how i want him to still talk and confide in me but i also want to show him i care and support him thanks for reading this far and ill take any advice i can get,post-pandemic

this past year was a whirlwind a lot of personal trauma and growth happened im finally on a medication combo that doesnt just mute the bipolar tv but actually turns it off it took me 8 years for my bachelors degree that is not personally fulfilling i occasionally threw around the idea of going premed but those kinds of goals are much too ambitious for someone contemplating suicide almost constantly well i fucking did it i was accepted into my colleges biology program its one of the hardest programs to get into at my school i am taking an intro to ochembiochem this semester and i received a 97 on the first test because i have been studying my ass off for the first time i feel like i have passion for something suicide isnt even in top 5 life plans anymore let along 1 ive been selfharm free for 8 weeks i feel a bit burnt out with work and school and parenting but this is also the best ive felt in my entire life but not in a way that is suspiciousi simply feel content which is something id never thought id say,pre-pandemic
theres a real push in pc culture right now for not just people with ptsd but rape and abuse victims also to not call themselves victim but rather survivor the problem with that is i was victimized that kind of language benefits the people who harm us because if they see us as survivors than they can go on abusing us and its like it doesnt matter you can do anything to a survivor also it shames people coming forward because the word victim has become negative and shameful i think instead of replacing victim with another word we should be making it so that victim is not a shameful thing to be you hear whining mostly on the right mostly aimed at women about people mostly women accused of playing the victim the solution to that isnt to call yourself something else but to assert that yes i am a victim but no i am not playing or pretending this all actually happened to me if i were a survivor i feel like that just makes me violable because im then expected to be tough enough to handle it it puts pressure on victims by telling us to get over it and cope and be strong rather than pressuring abusers to change their shitty patterns of behavior i understand that individual people might like feeling like a survivor but i feel like the label is toxic because its telling the victims how to approach handling being victimized i do want to be a victim because i was one and fuck anyone telling me what to call myself this was also brought up in the second season of thirteen reasons why and i thought like many mental health issues in that show that it was handled in such a garbage way basically a main character was raped while under the influence of alcohol at a party she has a hard time getting over it a feminist in charge of a rape survivors group tells her to join them when youre ready to stop being a victim and start being a survivor in other words her shaming the character into being the right kind of strong survivor type of person and being sad was seen as weak she was also shaming her into going forward with legal action against her rapist the show acted like it was important that she do that no sympathy for victims who do not report i feel like this is reflective of larger problems with society wanting everyone to always project an aura of strength and confidence where we bully ridicule and shame people for being weak or emotionally damaged,pre-pandemic

for my single guys i know its tough not having a girlfriend while everybody else does but you need to take action in order to find the perfect partner notes no woman will go up to you even if they like you use some humor or be interesting in some way even if youre like a 510 you are able of snatching that 10 youve dreamed of it just takes some time and a little bit of self love and respect and hard work obviously social anxiety its easy overcoming social anxiety just like getting a girlfriend it takes some time go up to a dude or girl at the bar the library the restaurant and just do some small talk force yourself to do it even if you dont want to at first you may end up with awkward conversations but you will get less awkward as time goes on ultimately overcoming social anxiety no social life the same steps apply as with the social anxiety go up to someone force yourself find a bro a frendgroup hang out with them regularly to avoid losing them and remember no one can believe in you more than you can no one can love you more than you can and no one can respect you more than you can you can do this ps i can smell the downvotes all i want is helping some poor soul trying to get his life together,post-pandemic

currently i have a casual relationship with a person i love very much and who was my fp when we first met although i would say its thankfully become less intense we see each other as much as possible and enjoy each others company immensely the thing i find triggering about this is the casual part he is non committal and does not wish to be in a relationship with me but insists that he cares about me and will be there for me even if we arent together i understand his feelings but when im having a breakdown all i can think about is him dating or falling for someone else and it hurts me very much is there a way to become better at casual relationships with bpd or is it just something thats always going to be hard,post-pandemic

i am an alcoholic i am 24 years old male and am drunk 6 days of the week i am recently unemployed but i have been trying to get a corporate job for months i was not fired from my most recent job due to being intoxicated it was a job that only lasts for one summer i spend my days interviewing with companies sober but i cannot land a job i am not creating this post because of my failure to get hired im creating this post because i wanted to see if there is anyone out there that can give me some advice on how to quit drinking because it has made me depressed but is the only thing that makes me happy when im depressed i drink anytime that i do not have to interact with someone who doesnt know im an alcoholic which is pretty much everyday since i just stay in my apartment alone and wait for my roommate to get home from work around 5 oclock i have a girlfriend who knows that i drink and i have asked her for help about my addiction but she doesnt really say anything except the typical girlfriend stuff like okay im here for you if you need help i am close with both parents and my two sisters but cannot reach out to them because i am too embarrassed i have dozens of friends that will help me but i am too embarrassed they dont know but if they did learn my other friends would somehow find out and having people talk about me behind my back might be worse than being an alcoholic ive thought about going to rehab but everyone i know would ask about my absence and the word would quickly spread about me going to rehab i dont want that x200b x200b if it gets bad enough that i need to go to rehab i will but if someone has any advice that can tell me how to quietly stop my addiction without any of my fiends and family knowing that i have problem i would greatly appreciate it,post-pandemic

i grew up in a householdculture where drinking was one of the biggest sins so i do not have a good reference point to know what is okay what is a problem and what is a disease i would drink basically daily in the evenings and get legit drunk depending on the weekend i would sometimes day drink too while i have been at various stages of hungover at work i have never consumed it during work it is not really impacting my work or social life as i am in a committed relationship she does not drink much and get plenty or raises and promotions at work my girlfriend also raised in the same culture said i was a highfunctioning alcoholic the other day and it hit me kinda hard i know i have a problem and if i have one drink i generally have three but i thought i was not an alcoholic because it was not hurting me professionally i know it is hurting my physically and that is not great since she said that i have not had anything to drink though i do some edibles to help me sleep it has been about 2 weeks and while i dont have withdrawal symptoms i definitely keep wanting to have a drink it is just will power over desire right now i know i have a problem with alcohol and i drink too much but do you all think i am a highfunctioning alcoholic,post-pandemic

on the journey of intervention now the daughter is almost eight changed a lot since she was 25 we knocked every door and still knocking the well known remains language and social deficits that have shrunk in that period we are very happy school inclusion should be a fact of intervention we fought public schools and are getting what we want we are rather a poor family where paying for programs and books have been an obstacle we have borrowed printed and the like we still need one particular book everyday classroom strategies and practices for supporting children with autism spectrum disorders written by jamie d bleiweiss phd lauren hough msed and shirley cohen phd i have read a preview of it but could not find the rest it is an excellent book that put a certain inclusive classroom s practice with particular emphasis class organization teachers roleetc the book provides the structure or bones of the asd nest program along with the story of how it was created a sampling of the content of the program and a general picture of how it was doing a description of the students served by the asd nest the professional development program that undergirds the asd nest the challenges in sustaining an inclusion program for children with asd within a large urban school system and the voices of parents of children served by this program are also included in that book i highly recommend it from the preview i signaled above to be able to devise implement and monitor the school as regards the sincere implementation of this crucial inclusive education for children of autism this program is not in any way the only or the most applied practice i remain to see how it works as respect my daughter other programs could benefit other children the bottom line is actually how a program is implemented to provide for the particular needs and strengths of every child in the end i hope if anyone could tell me of a download link where i can have that book or a cheap version of it you can pm on this issue and any other thing you want to know from my almost 6 years of diligent work i am sorry for the long message thank you and best regards,pre-pandemic

sorry if this is really disorganized im not sure what the best way to say this is so i went back to therapy because i was sexually assaulted by my boyfriend some number of times and its really messing w me i know i need to leave and everything but im still working on that its been a couple of years since the first time it happened and every since i have been thinking about it nonstop it changed to whichever time stuck out the most it affects everything i do all the time but i go through periods where i am even more fixated on it and google every possible deviation from the subject i cant pay attention to media unless its related to what happened there have been times where ive sobbed and panicked about it but generally i dont feel anything at all i barely sleep i have dreams about it but they dont wake me up in fact ive started writing them down to remember them better i have recurring episodes of paralysis every time i go back to him i seal my own fate my therapist seems think this was traumatic for me but i cant begin to admit that it may have been because i dont feel like i care i dont understand because im so fixated on it but i have no feelings i would say im self triggering but i dont feel triggered the one caveat is that i avoid sexual acts with him now im just so confused because this seems to be the opposite of ptsd but my therapist disagrees has anyone else experienced this,post-pandemic
for over the past few years ive always had suicidal thoughts in the back of my head was mostly passive more just if i feel trapped at least i can look to it as an option well past year or so my thoughts have been a lot more active i have a plan itll require a bit of money but im sure ill pull it off just after christmas i did decide to ring up and actually start seeing a therapist i told them about my problems how i feel exactly the fact i know longer really take care of myself etc i barely eat anhmore 1 meal a day in the evening is enough id rather just starve myself i dont plan on seeing a dentist regarding my toothache cause i dont see myself being around for very much longer ive started to hit myself and even began skipping classes in my final semester they pretty much just told me to write down all my thoughts well for some reason theres no concern at all to what i said im not putting this on why would anyone willingly want to be sad all the time it just doesnt make sense so much going on in my brain constantly idk what to do it feels like im 100 down in a game and only 20 minutes have been played i know i fucked up and its not possible to restart life id rather just end the game tbh it feels like im fighting a losing battle i cant tell anyone i feel like a fraud cause if my therapist wont take me seriously who else will itll come as a huge shock to 99 of the people who know me i would also like to give some of my money away to my 10 closest friends as i said it would be a shock but hopefully at least understandable this probably seems like ramblings of a madman but yeah,post-pandemic
thisll be long but i just have so much to say and i dont even know how to start or end this post because ive been through so much pain and struggle that i cant think of any other solution other than suicide i dont really have friends anymore because they have their own issues to deal with and are moving into the next stage of their life this is evident in how we dont talk or see each other as much anymore ive reached out but nothings really happened out of it meanwhile im still stuck lagging behind even after my multiple attempts of trying to continue onto that same path i know thats not entirely possible that ill be achieving all that theyre achieving given my audhd diagnosis and that some of those milestones are not something im interested in such as being in a romantic relationship but i am realistic enough to know that at least some of those goals are achievable by me and are things i do want for myself eg finishing uni getting a job getting my license living on my own etc im now in mid 20s but i feel like ive regressed into a toddler its so hard to continue when im barely making any progress despite how much effort mental emotional and financial ive put in last night my neighbours called the police on me because i was so loud because of one of my meltdowns and it was a new low for me i had no one but my brother around to help and he is not the greatest support so i just felt awful my mother was staying with her boyfriend at the time when the police came over to the house and she only called back an hour or so after the police left she didnt come home until the next day the police even asked me if i should be admittted to the hospital again but i said no since they were not helpful just like all other instances i was admitted it would just make things harder for me i have been given new meds that havent done anything to address my problems though im still not at the therapeutic dosage ive told the psychiatrist about this and theyve now rapidly increased the titration process to 60mg this week and 80mg the next and onwards after which my gp will deal with me i havent met them yet but i already dont like them as they were unhelpful when i couldnt get out of bed because of my depression so my mother just went by herself to ask what options were available to me and all he said to her was she has to be here for this appointment it was so demeaning when my mother relayed this information to me and it accelerated my next suicide attempt 2 months ago ive tried everything thats been suggested to me to help with my thoughts but 99 has not been helpful the other 1 has had minimal effects and i do implement it now but it is not enough ive seeked out journal articles youtube videos books for all the help and i just keep finding a dead end its futile and im upset and tired all the time i want to go and relax but i cant since i now live far away from the main city where i have limited accessibility i cant take public transport anymore since my anxiety levels are at an all time high and takes me 2 or so hours to commute i dont have a license to drive and neither does my mother and brother so i cant rely on them i have to ride an uber which costs around 2030 bucks to just go to a mall that isnt the main city where i used to live double or triple that for a oneway trip to the main city add onto that i also have a tailbone injury that doesnt allow me to sit for more than 30 minutes at a time per my chiropractors advice i still do for the uber ride to see the chiropractor because how can i not but its still very painful i also am not at uni anymore or working i still havent applied for disability benefit and i have had my injury since october last year as applying was so daunting and hard to me i was right and i have only now made some progress but i honestly dont care about it anymore whats the point im a burden to the state and to my family my mother doesnt want me to kill myself yet she has not accommodated my needs when i have told her multiple times what it is i need i have tried to meet her halfway on some things even though its uncomfortable for me however there are also things i cant compromise on because i know that the compromise shes suggesting doesnt work ive tried it and its failed i dont want to be like this and frankly im just tired of it all now ive tried so hard to fight the internal voices but they are the most rational to me no one else has made a much more compelling argument that ive heard so far im in so much agony after everything thats happened and i dont see any future ahead of me not anymore i have nothing to live for if i continue living i know itll get worse because it already has,post-pandemic

i have known my pcp for some time even before i had health anxiety i saw her many times in last year or so with usual ha symptoms dizziness fatigue palpitations in my last visit after she did that test where they ask you to squeeze their hand as hard as possible she did not let go of my hands and with my hands in hers she explained to me that nothing seems to be wrong with me physically and all my symptoms are most likely due to anxiety and stress it was so heartfelt and sincere that whole interactions calmed me down a lot the side effect is that now i got other type of heart ache i have got this full blown crush on a lady who is like 20 years older to me and i dont know what to do with it,pre-pandemic
ive been gaining weight more rapidly for a year and yet if i express any discontent with or worry about that it is used by my therapistteam as evidence that i need a higher level of care whcih i disagree with its only iop and i dont think i need it it is so frustrating and makes me want to just quit any attempt to recover or heal any of my disordered thoughts if i need to keep gaining weight to do so im not purging im very clearly overweight and not that far from obese at this point so its actively unhealthy for me to gain weight and yet no one shows literally any concern for it happening jfc id just like an acknowledgement that this is being taken into consideration medically me getting fatter only serves to make my behaviors worse me continuing to get bigger only makes me hate myself how is it logical that i should have to increase my self hatred before i can work on it all of this when it is medically unhealthy for me to gain weight im just really upset because i feel like im being haesbody positivity brainwashed,post-pandemic

almost an year ago i suffered a devastating neurological condition called guillainbarre i was almost fully paralyzed and i am still recovering how well i will recover it cant be known the majority of people who make a somewhat full recovery do so in the first 612 months i am not one of those people i dont know how well i will recover the recovery usually lasts 23 years during my recovery i was getting more and more accepting of the idea that i will suffer long term damage just now its sinking in that it made be worse than anticipated and every loss i suffered with the added agony of toxic positivism the truth is it is devastating i used to be a very active person and now i can run for just a couple of seconds i could play the piano and now my fingers are crooked i cant mourn this loss it just builds and builds because well now i can be independent right there are people who stay bound in wheelchairs right you should be grateful you can afford not to work honestly i can adapt to this new reality i can still swim i can work out a bit i hope i can run more one day but even than what i have is still enough to feel joy in life what i wont be able to adapt to is the cruelty of people all veiled behind the stay positive vibe i can stay positive if i know there is a place for negativity if i know i can cry on someone elses shoulder and be listened to and comforted not being scolded for being ungrateful enough while leaving on the turning away on people just averting their eyes refusing to listen what i am going through and gutting me with platitudes or the ever dreaded you have to do this on your own or only you understand what you are going through its so lazy well you can always ask and listen i am happy to share and talk and cry in so much details but how can others understand when they just dont even want to try such a cold and disconnected world void of empathy void of comfort,post-pandemic

i suffer from pretty severe dissociation particularly derealization where nothing feels real and it feels like an observer of my thoughts and im just watching a movie through my eyes i met a lovely guy and were very similar in that were both introverted want to connect over deep meaningful talks and we are both sensitive i opened up to him over skype today saying that i am worried that i wont remember him and if we dont talk my brain will tell me that i was dreaming him and our interactions never happened he reacted in the most heartwarming way possible he told me he was going to send me frequent letters in the mail he lives abroad and my favourite hot cheetos just so whenever i doubt myself i can just read and hold the letter to remind myself that hes real and there for me it was so meaningful that i cried right there and then i feel on top of the world,pre-pandemic
does anybody else feel utterly alone when going through a breakdown and nobody responds or is available to help its frustrating a friend could help me through 50 breakdowns then once they dont and i feel unlovable and uncared for questioning the friendship or a therapist can reasure me over and over again once the dont and bam theyre a bad person they dont care about me and theyve been lying to me this whole time etc i hate that i always feel like this but once i split i cant think straight and feel like completely alone in the world,post-pandemic

hello ive been experiencing a very bad episode of ha for the last few months i cannot see the only doctor available where i live im in a small village in france for the 5th time in two months especially that shes so judgmental and making hints that i should not come back and that i must stop waisting insurance money for nothing also it will be a long time for me to see another doctor so googling my symptoms is the only way for me to keep track on the development of my symptoms i am honestly lost because im not sure if googling is a good idea and everyone here agrees that i should stop googling my symptoms which is what im desperately trying to do for the last week i wanna know if you have any tips on how to abolish the thought of googling the symptoms thank you,post-pandemic

its always so awkward when someone finds out how my name is actually pronounced and they ask whyd you let me call you that i never know what to say im not sure if others have experienced this im just curious personally im from afghanistan and have a very unique name most people havent heard it takes them many tries to pronounce it correctly and eventually i gave up i now go by my last name which is easier to pronounce personally i dont like it but i noticed americans have a lot of trouble with foreign names nothing against them i get it i just feel awkward trying to explain how my name is pronounced over and over again,post-pandemic

hello all i wanted to ask yalls opinions because im short on people who know my situation and im guessing many here do my girlfriend of just over a year is an alcoholic she started her sobriety on september 30th 2023 i found her stash on january 30th and she has restarted and was doing well until i just found another one of her stashes not as much this time but theres no way its just left over from last time because i cleaned out everything i havent confronted her because she is at an aa meeting as we speak i dont know what to do i want to support her but when is enough enough it would not let me post this in the alanon sub reddit,post-pandemic
i have a lot of anxiety when it comes to setting boundaries for myself because im a chronic people pleaser i know that typically this is something i would need to work out in therapy but im in between therapists right now because i struggle in terms of i know what my problems are and i know that i am right to set the boundary but i dont actually feel better about anything so talk therapy doesnt help i know that im going to be in a situation soon where i will need to set a boundary with a family member but im so anxious and stressed about it and i typically forget what i want to say because the people please takes over and i just shut down so i never set the boundary plus i already know there will be a negative reaction so that makes it worse because there is no hope for a positive reaction so honestly just hearing from anyone else who struggles with this so i know im not alone or any advice on what helps you through situations like this,post-pandemic

as a russian conscript who has made it back home the weight of my experiences on the battlefield still bears down on me the relentless brutality of war has etched memories into my mind that refuse to fade each day is a battle against the ghosts of the past haunted by the sights sounds and smells of combat ptsd is my constant companion a shadow that lurks in the darkest corners of my mind it manifests in flashbacks that transport me back to the chaos of the battlefield in nightmares that leave me drenched in sweat and gasping for air its the hypervigilance that keeps me on edge the slightest sound triggering a flood of adrenaline and fear to those who leave cowardly comments on my reddit page know this your words hold no power over me ive faced far greater challenges than your feeble attempts to diminish my experiences while you hide behind your keyboard ive stared death in the face and lived to tell the tale but make no mistake ptsd is not a badge of honor its a relentless torment that no one should have to endure its the shattered relationships the sleepless nights the overwhelming sense of guilt and shame its the invisible wounds that cut deeper than any physical injury so before you hurl insults from the safety of your screen take a moment to consider the reality of war and its lasting impact instead of mocking those who have sacrificed so much show some semblance of humanity and compassion because while your words may not bother me they reveal far more about your character than mine silhouette in the dimly lit trench amidst the suffocating stench of mud and decay i crouched low my heart pounding in my chest like a relentless drumbeat the distant sounds of artillery fire echoed through the earth a constant reminder of the chaos that surrounded us it was a moonless night the darkness swallowing everything in its path i strained my eyes trying to make out any movement in the shadows beyond the tree line in front of me suddenly a rustling sound pierced the silence and i tensed my grip tightening on my rifle out of the darkness emerged a figure clad in camouflage his silhouette barely visible against the backdrop of the night instinct took over as i raised my weapon my finger trembling on the trigger in that moment he was not an enemy but a threat to my survival the crack of gunfire split the air followed by the sickening thud of a body hitting the ground time seemed to stand still as i stared at the lifeless figure before me his blood staining the earth beneath him it was a moment of triumph and horror a stark reminder of the gravity if my situation but as the adrenaline faded the reality of what i had done began to sink in the weight of his lifeless gaze bore into my soul accusing me of the ultimate betrayal guilt and remorse clawed at my conscience threatening to consume me from within in the days that followed the memory of that fateful night haunted my every waking moment the faces of the fallen soldier haunted my dreams their accusing whispers echoing in the depths of my mind a relentless torment that refused to release its grip ivan in the darkness of the tree line amidst the tangled branches and whispering leaves my friend ivan lay cradled in my arms his life slipping away with each shallow breath the distant rumble of artillery fire provided a haunting soundtrack to our final moments together a grim reminder of the war that raged around us ivans face was pale his eyes glassy and unfocused as he gazed up at me with a mixture of pain and resignation blood seeped from the wound in his chest staining his uniform crimson and pooling beneath him on the forest floor i tried to stem the flow with trembling hands but it was futile the damage was too great and time was running out desperation clawed at my throat as i searched for words of comfort but none came how could i offer solace in the face of such senseless tragedy ivan was not just a comrade but a friend a brotherinarms whose laughter had once filled the quiet moments between battles as i watched the light fade from ivans eyes a profound sense of loss washed over me threatening to engulf me in its depths we had shared so much hopes dreams fears but now all that remained were memories fragile and fleeting like smoke in the wind in his final moments ivan reached out a trembling hand grasping mine with surprising strength his lips parted as if struggling to form words that would never come but in that silent exchange we said more than words ever could a bond forged in the crucible of war unbreakable and eternal and so as ivan slipped away into the embrace of oblivion i held him close whispering words of farewell into the darkness his sacrifice would not be forgotten his memory etched forever in the hearts of those who knew and loved him in the end all that remained was the echo of his laughter fading into the stillness of the night the bmp the bmp rattled along the rugged terrain the sound of its engine drowned out by the constant rumble of artillery in the distance i sat inside gripping my rifle tightly my senses on high alert without warning a deafening explosion shook the vehicle throwing me off balance smoke filled the air as flames engulfed the bmp forcing me to act fast i unbuckled my harness and scrambled out of the wreckage my heart pounding in my chest as i sprinted towards the nearest trench for cover bullets whizzed past me kicking up dirt and debris i dove into the trench just in time seeking refuge from the chaos around me moments later i heard footsteps approaching adrenaline surged through me as i readied my rifle preparing for a fight an enemy soldier emerged from the smoke his weapon raised and his eyes locked on me with deadly intent we exchanged gunfire the sound of bullets whizzing past my head filling me with a sense of urgency each shot brought us closer to death but neither of us was willing to back down in the end it came down to quick reflexes and sheer determination with a final burst of adrenaline i took down the enemy soldier his lifeless body slumping to the ground as the dust settled and the echoes of battle faded away i emerged from the trench shaken but alive it was a brutal reminder of the harsh realities of war where survival often came down to splitsecond decisions and sheer luck i see how peoples are set against one another and in silence unknowingly foolishly obediently innocently slay one another erich maria remarque all quiet on the western front,post-pandemic
hi everyone i hope that you are well and better than me haha on saturday i tried cocaine for the first time i have always been nervous and scared around drugs but i am a big raver and in the group i was with i was the only one not using drugs so i decided to try it and i have never felt more guilty in my life to preface i am a huge control freak and i have anxiety over it i absolutely hate when something takes over my mind and i feel like it has taken over my mind the past two days i feel like i crave it but deep down i know i dont want it because it has made me feel absolutely terrible the last two days i had a bout of withdrawal from antidepressants because of an adverse reaction my doc thought i had ocd nope i just am a control freak haha that took a while to recover from it was awful and i told myself that i would never do anything to feel like that again but here i am back i feel as if this is a milder version of what i experienced coming off antidepressants but i am seriously scared to death anxiety mood swings cravings even though i never want to do it again this is the symptom that i hate the most i am so scared that maybe ill even be impulsive and try it again leading to an unsafe pattern i really dont want to be an addict losing control of myself is my biggest fear in the world i only took one tiny bump as i was well aware of comedowns and how they make me feel i did it and surprisingly did not crave it for the rest of the night i only feel cravings now i stupidly thought that there would be no comedown for the small bump i took but boy was i wrong so basically what i am asking for is reassurance i need people to tell me that this will pass i know deep down it will pass but i feel like i cant trust myself and my mind right now with the cravings and dark thoughts im just scared i fucked my life up i wish i never tried it and could go back to who i was before i tried it i just dont want to think about it any tips with dealing with the comedown are appreciated im scared of my mind and i feel like ive lost control of my thoughts i dont feel like myself and i want to feel like myself does anybody know how long this could last,post-pandemic

so i partook in 2 discord servers actually 3 but the third was a dead server so i dont count it and both left me more miserable than i was when i entered them here are some of the lessons i learned 1 it feels like walking on eggshells many people there are really insecure and have trauma so youll have to be extremely careful with what you say in which way and to whom because some people could interpret what you say in the worst possible way they will escalate non problems and make drama out of nothing 2 hurt people hurt people the victims become the aggressors the people that in their real life are probably alone and the victims love to feel powerful in a server like this and they will victimise other people 3 small groups inside the server will form either way making you feel like an outsider the people that were outsiders irl exclude other people once they finally find a groups of friends from the server 4 simps no other explanation needed 5 it can give you a false impression at first i felt welcomed for days that discord was almost all my human interaction ive had so i felt happy then when i got victimised and cast aside it hurt me so much i cried a whole night which is actually pathetic i was fooled to believe i belong somewhere and when i hit the reality it hurt me 6 its a waste of time look i know its comforting but it does you no good you and me need to go outside to work on yourselves to find hobbies and to build real friendships those friendships on discord arent real and they do waste a lot of your time 7 diversity of thoughts dont exist there this is linked with the points 1 2 and 4 if i have a different opinion from another person but they get upset i am the bad guy some people would be so insecure that they would be really upset just because you have a different opinion and the rest of the people would comfort the emotional person while looking at you like youre an asshole also if a female user has an opinion usually shed have an army of simps defending her and attacking you if you disagree 8 many attention seekers and people playing the victim card a user can act like a jerk to you during a conversation but nobody would say anything if you dont act like a victim on the other hand you can be very polite but if the jerk plays the victim card youll be the one labelled as an asshole if you dont act like a victim or youre not a woman you dont matter 9 they are very cultlike come to our server where everyone is accepted my ass theyll accept you as long as you fit their description of how someone should act and for many of them the kindness is just performative its an act in conclusion it hurts but i think staying in does servers would have hurt me a lot more in the long term now i have to take the next period and just work on myself try to quit internet and just face the reality no more comforts wish me luck,post-pandemic
two years ago i made my first of three suicide attempts along with my untreated manic depressionmy ptsd was unbearable i couldnt sleep i couldnt go out anywhere touch or noise could send me into a flash back or panic and i didnt want to face another 40 years of hell after some time in hospital a ridiculous amount of hard work my amazing therapist some great meds and a tribe of humans that i couldnt have survived without i was told today by my treatment team that i dont have enough symptoms anymore to be classified as having ptsd i just needed to share im very proud of myself,pre-pandemic

lets get this right its your breathing that affects your state of being meaning if you cant breath deeply it will put you into a state of anxiety because your nervous system cant relax you having anxiety isnt the reason you cant take deep breaths but instead i propose its a hormonal imbalance more specifically estrogen dominancegoogle high estrogen and youll see inability to take deep breaths as a sympyom i have different ways to dealing with this issue one of which fixs the issue within 510 minutes and it also proovs my point first id like to lay the foundasion of my theory we live in a society where estrogen is everywhere we cant get away from it and because we dont see it we dont suspect anything whether its the estrogen in the water system that enters your body everytime you take a shower drink a glass of water or do the washing up or the pesticides that are sprayed over the majority of the foods you eat to the ink in the reciets that contains high bpa or the plastics that leach from the plastic bottlestubs into the water or food into your system add to that obesity is higher than ever as fast food has explodedour fat cells produce estrogen the more bodyfat you have the more estrogen you produce all of this make it impossible to avoid estrogen now its not all doom and gloom heres whats making a massive difference to fight this dht kills estrogen in the body when i eat sourgum flour which increases your dht a lot my stomach flattens and within 510 minutes my bloating goes away after eating sourgum its sooooooooo much easier to take deep breaths you also have to make a concious effort to ditch plastics from your life if you dont want to get a reverse osmosis system that filters the estrogen out then drink clean water from a glass bottle voss is the best i foundexpensive but you are investing in your health i know in my heart of hearts this is the solution to the issue that is facedby a lot of people in this day and age do these steps as well as getting as lean as possible and youll see a big difference i hope i helped open peoples eyes to whats actually going on when i lost a few kilos of fat it was a lot easier to take deep breaths and when included sourgum flour into my diet it made the world of difference if you ignore this post then you are doing your selfs an injustice you owe it to your selfs to at least try the sourgum and see the immediet difference goodluck,post-pandemic
this is a little mantra i say to myself when im struggling with health anxiety it has helped me quite a bit with my own symptoms i am reasonably young healthy active etc so when i get a symptom of some looming catastrophe that can very reasonably be attributed to anxiety i make a conscious effort to assume it is only anxiety for me i experience shortness of breath chest tightness or pain numbness of arms or lips twitches sour stomach blurry vision throat tightness and others all of these can be caused by anxiety for me deciding to assume it is only anxiety and tell myself so has gone a long way to me moving through the symptoms and getting back to life of course this is coupled with no googling whatsoever no trips to the er or the doc without good cause etc id rather assume its anxiety and run the minuscule risk that i am some wild outlier than assume im the wild outlier and ruin day after day with allconsuming worry if you have reason to believe youre healthy and well maybe this little mantra can help you too health anxiety is difficult but missing out on the stuff of life is no good either good luck everyone one day at a time,pre-pandemic

before i came across this subs i didnt even know what gaslighting was it was something so ingrained in our family dynamic that i didnt realise how toxic it was my nmom is the worst for it i never had a name for it but i just knew there was no point in ever challenging her about anything because her story always changes well this weekend i was the one to do it im ashamed to admit that this is not my first time but im actively working to change my partner very kindly did lots of house work as this is a contentious issue for us at times when i saw he had done so much i didnt know if saying thank you and making a big deal would cause tension so i left it with the aim to say thank you later as i was making lunch he made a light hearted comment about how i didnt thank him for doing the housework instead of apologising and saying it in the moment i replied i did cant you remember as soon as the words left my mouth my heart sunk yuck what was i doing so i quickly caught myself and said oh shit i didnt actually say it did i i just thought it doesnt really count when you do that sorry haha and then proceeded to tell him how thankful i was i hate that this is an automatic response for me to lie like this but hopefully if i keep challenging myself i can eradicate it from my reflexes,pre-pandemic
i cant keep doing this ive been an addict for almost ten years now and its getting so exhausting ive never once had any road to damascus moments that have stuck and successfully quit anything for good the only reason ive ever stopped doing a thing is because i got tired of it or ran out of money its never a conscious effort and any time i try it fails so my current coping mechanism is just waiting an addiction out until my brain is done with it ill get addicted to anything abused dph for like a year and felt like i had schizophrenia but it was preferable to real life sick of people saying everything is great and your life improves when you get sober it doesnt youre just depressed craving and waiting for your next fuck up everyones disappeared from my life because of my issues except my parents but theyre so persistent and never give up on me and i feel so fucking guilty for ruining their life by being such a stupid weak junkie fuck lifefuck people i just want to do drugs until i overdose and dont have to fight anymore,post-pandemic

i think about this sometimes and im not sure if anyone else has had this similar thought as much as id love to find someone to love and have a relationship with it quite literally will not happen if im afraid to talk to people and be myself definitely an oddly depressing realization lol ive also kinda gave up on even trying since i cant really force someone to like me and i hate feeling like an asshole bound to happen when you are rejected some days i think about going the escort route but after post nut clarity i realize im not looking for sex im looking for someone to take a nap with go out to eat with chill with im looking for a close friend basically lmao,post-pandemic
hi yall i 24f just need some reassurance i guess so life has been very stressful for about the past two years i was able to get through it without changing medicines but the doses were upped it did help now i feel that it is not helping as much as it did i usually try to sit with what im feeling to make sure it wasnt just an off couple of days before considering medication changes i know my meds are not working that well when i also feel that ive been pulling my weight i feel that you and the meds are a team and one doesnt work as well without the other and i still dont feel like im where i should be i have been on meds and in therapy since 10 and i would not be here if i wasnt afforded that help anyways my doctor told me to think about bringing down my wellbutrin dose while adding vraylar for the anxiety and depression she made it clear that i dont have a mood disorder and that this can also be used for major depressive disorder i am also on the highest dose of prozac and i have ativan for when i really cant stand the anxiety the side effects of changing meds is what scares me most i knock on wood rarely have any side effects from any meds i take and im very lucky for that something has to change because i cannot stay in this state of anxiety the other reason i made this post is because it makes me feel a little down that i have to experiment with meds just so i can be normal almost like its embarrassing that my brain doesnt work right so i have to help it lol i always worry about losing control or clinically going crazy i only feel this way about myself for others i tell them you didnt choose the circumstances and things were made to help you live a better life and that there should be no shame in that feel free to share any advice or experiences youve had on the above topics i posted here because i dont want to feel so alone in what im dealing with thank you,post-pandemic

ive been seeing a psychiatrist and have been on every antidepressant and antianxiety medication for 4 years since being committed after a suicide attempt i wasted all those years still being miserable i finally fired him and tapered off all my meds i felt free like i broke up with a controlling boyfriend i knew i needed to work on the core of why im so miserable lots of trauma so i scheduled an appointment with a well regarded trauma therapist she spent the whole appointment covering herself she said i was passively suicidal i said i have no intention of hurting myself again but see no meaning in life she said i needed to be stabilized she sort of threatened she might need to commit me which was a very traumatic experience for me and said shed need to discuss my history with my old psychiatrist and she probably wouldnt be able to work with me unless i was at least on antidepressants again she forced me to sign the release form to get on the books for another appointment i left feeling really pissed off drove home wrote her an email explaining what a disappointment it was revoked her rights to discuss anything with my old psychiatrist and cancelled my next appointment im just venting all i wanted was someone who could to talk with me and help me that way most of my trauma is centered around horrible medical care so its a big deal for me to reach out for help only to be screwed over again,pre-pandemic
i was bullied severely as a child nearly every day for nearly ten years i was laughed at ridiculed spat on kicked shoved pushed in front of roads told to kill myself several times and assaulted i am having real trouble trying to heal from this as a result ive developed different kinds of trauma possibly as a result of cptsd as well as body dysmorphic disorder today i was on the train coming home from work and these five or six boys possibly saw me already in the window and decided to all sit by me staring at me and giggling one or two of them burst out laughing and they each said are we all laughing at the same thing here and great that were all on the same page called me ugly patronised me inside i was trying to tell myself they were immature teens they all looked around 14 15 and im 19 but i was trying to be strong then i just crumbled i was back in a classroom again being stared at and laughed at being called names i wasnt thinking properly anymore everything felt blurry i felt scared and upset moved to a different seat this made them laugh more it only happened for a few minutes but felt like hours they got off at the next stop but didnt let it go as they walked by me to get off they called me more names and had the last laugh basically banging on the window i was sitting next to on the platform i felt really weak and powerless so i just started to cry literally sobbing in my hands some people did check up on me and made sure i felt supported one girl gave me a hug the lady sitting in front of me said that their words didnt matter my selfconfidence and selflove was what mattered most i am very thankful for them but i just cant help but wonder how the hell am i not over this i thought id healed i am very much a changed person from who i was when i was 10 but what did they see that they thought was worth laughing about why did they do this and why did i embarrass myself i had no selfcontrol in that moment and i broke down even though people were comforting me and reassuring me that nothing was wrong with me just those boys how silly and childish they are but im scarred by this im really down now just sitting at home with tears in my eyes very shaken up my hands are trembling as i write this i have never ever had a flashback with my verbal bullying before only a bad assault that happened alongside the bullying i had been very strong with my bullying trauma until now i dont understand why this has to happen to me i was having such a good day,post-pandemic

i started 2024 with a bang and i felt like my medication was doing wonders concerta 72mg and my impulsivity and distractibility were so much less problematic i still had moments of both but i would always bounce back my motivation was also higher than ever but last week everything tanked i slid into a black hole of adhd that was a brutal reminder of everything i was trying to escape i was still taking my meds but it was a fullblown dr jekyll and mr hyde situation and i was mr hyde im sitting here freaking out not only do i feel all my adhd symptoms rushing back but im also going back into the infinite loop where i get depressed about the symptoms anxious about deadlines and cope with maladaptive behaviours like compulsive gaming and scrolling which feed me back into the loop again this is the old me but im maxed on concerta and it was working just fine a minute ago what the fk is going on has anyone been through this i have therapists and coaches telling me to try various behavioural interventions eg journaling or mindfulness and my mr hyde brain is nodding along going sure right after i blow everything up okay,post-pandemic
five years ago i made a post on here detailing my experience overcoming health anxiety and i just recently became active again i made this decision after stumbling across the immense amount of people suffering with health anxiety on a daily basis in the megathread i decided i would start responding to these daily posts in the hopes that a small amount of my time could potentially make a big difference for someone who feels lost that brings me to the subject of this post one thing i see time and time again in this thread is people mistaking health anxiety with having anxiety about your health these are completely different things health anxiety is a mental health disorder thankfully one of the most treatable and the absolute hallmark of this disorder shall we say a requirement of this disorder is that at the bare minimum you need to have been seen by a medical professional i will repeat that again in order to have health anxiety you must have been to a medical professional if you havent then you dont have health anxiety at least not yet now i know what you might be thinking even if i havent been to a medical professional isnt it possible that my symptoms are caused by stress and anxiety of course the answer is a resounding yes but you have to understand that health anxiety has little to do with those symptoms and rather your reaction to those symptoms it is completely normal for people to experience uncomfortable bodily sensations and to assume the worst thats just part of being human for many of us i was one time discussing this with a friend who is a nurse she told me that every year around the holidays they have thousands of people come in complaining of chest pain thinking they are having a heart attack but in reality they are just stressed out about the holiday season the difference between people with health anxiety versus people who just have anxiety about their health can typically first be seen in how they react when a doctor tells them nothing is wrong with them and it is just stress a person without health anxiety will be relieved to know nothing is wrong with them and generally that will mark the end of this experience a person with health anxiety on the other hand will tend to mistrust the diagnosis assume the doctor is simply incompetent or hasnt ordered enough tests and this will often times start a multimonth or multiyear journey of seeking out a diagnosis that was already provided but simply not accepted if you are going into the daily thread to post about medical symptoms that you have never been checked out for you are in the wrong place not only is this subreddit not made for you but the comforting replies you may expect to get in that thread will only serve to hurt you by potentially delaying your motivations to see a doctor the truth is even if you do have health anxiety the best thing you can do is see a doctor to confirm that that is a cornerstone of the healing process because it provides you with the ammunition to react more appropriately to your unrealistic thoughts the sad reality is that anxiety about your health is not a disorder that is just part of being human it is when that anxiety becomes irrational meaning you refuse to accept the results of tests or your reactions to bodily sensations are considered far outside the norm and when that irrational anxiety begins to negatively affect your life and ability to function that you have health anxiety,post-pandemic

this might be triggering for people with substance abuse history or sa victims so be careful i had a dream where i woke up in a bed and i felt like i was being watched because the bedroom had endless windows so i left the bedroom and went to another one that was less spacious but it still had too many windows i tried to sleep there but when i closed my eyes i woke up to the sound of my dad he said im drinking yeah but its no big deal im gonna get another drink and i opened my eyes and followed his voice and saw him drunk drinking his liver dead i was hurt so i tried to walk away he said where are you going drink with me i ignored him and ran away and then he disappeared i found my mom smoking heroin and blowing it in my face i was mad and i told her daddy is drinking again and now youre back to heroin and she laughed and said it was no big deal i ran away and slept on a couch but when i woke up on the couch again i was still dreaming but this time i couldnt move and i saw a bunch of random men surrounding me with smiles i couldnt speak or move my body just my eyes they said this will feel good for you and raped me while i could not do a thing i woke up again and i was back in the bed near my dad and he looked at me with regret and said im sorry for drinking i ignored him and realized at this point that i was dreaming and i was stuck in a ptsd nightmare so i tried to think of going to a place where no one could hurt me i closed my eyes and imagined going to space but as soon as i went there it was terrifying i kept falling and falling and falling and there was not a single star in sight it was just an endless black void of nothing when i opened my eyes again i saw the rapists again but i could move this time they said its such a shame you can move now so i tried to run away but everywhere i tried to run past an exit i got stuck in this barrier that felt like trying to walk past gelatin it kept me trapped in the room with them and i realized that i would have rather suffocated to death in the gelatin than have anyone touch me like that again i suffocated and woke up,post-pandemic

edited to add missing info ive been really putting my all into recovery for the past 7 months and ive done so well my boyfriend loves my new body and makes sure i know that he made a joke about getting fat and honestly i laughed it off and thought nothing of it but about a week later it really hit me and i joined the gym again and really started restricting after about 3 weeks of heavy restriction and intense running i did a pregnancy test and found out im pregnant not fat lol since i found out i really tried so hard to eat well and enough im still tracking what i eat and limiting myself a little bit but im really trying and i know were all in this forum because we had moms with eds who ruined our lives i really think i can recover and be the best mom to this little baby i already feel so connected and in love but yesterday and today i dont know what happened to me and i purged everything ive eaten two days in a row i know i cannot do this throughout and the damage to the baby physically now and mentally later would be horrific if i continue but i know i can do this because ive given myself food freedom and been happy before i basically just need a real wake up call to snap me out of this bad few days and do everything i need to do for this new life,post-pandemic
people with bpd are abusive and manipulative when someone either knows you have bpd or learns your attachment pattern for them they figure out how easy it is for them to get away with everything for example someone whos your fp figuring out your loyalty to them and that how no matter how much you lose it you come crawling back so theyll be more relaxed about fucking things up because its not easy for you to just leave the relationship forever theyll take advantage of your passion and leave you alone when youre upset does this happen in every relationship no but its not uncommon for someone to learn you have a disorder specifically affecting relationships to learn how to work with that as a result of this im conflicted when it comes to telling loved ones about my mental health,pre-pandemic
just because someone tells you my adhd works like doesnt mean you butt in and correct them saying thats not how adhd works adhd along with having a disorder in general is a very complex experience its very invalidating to just blatantly assume your adhd works the same as everyone elses or even fake claim them never ever make assumptions maybe your experience isnt as diabolical as others as well so dont belittle the symptoms of adhd that others experience that you havent you know perfectly what its like for misinformed people to not understand you and make assumptions so dont do the same thing if you see someone do this at least try to see both sides of the situation before concluding oh this person is crappy and faking their experiences or ew this person is so rude and condescending i understand there can be miscommunicationsmisunderstandings i think because its easy for us to be misunderstood its also easy for us to think that someone is just self diagnosing and thus the urge to educate them is strong but maybe its best to stop and think is this person actually faking itbeing ignorant or are they just experiencing something different from me i wish people would be more understanding and stop assuming things or trying to educate others just to feel better about themselves or something,post-pandemic
my entire life i have never really experienced true happiness i will have moments that are somewhat happy but i am always just playing a role and putting on airs around people every time i try to make my life better i always end up worse than when i started and no matter how hard i try i feel that death would be such a relief however i really dont want to die i just wish i could actually experience happiness and live in the moment like other people do for over 40 years this has been my struggle and no matter how many times ive tried my life had always ended up worse than when i started right now im homeless staying with my sister with out a job and couldnt feel any more worthless i am struggling and in constant pain from medical issues and when all is said and dont i truly feel like death would be so much easier than trying anymore,post-pandemic
i18m have always been antisocial and anxious every time im in a social situation only people who have ever been my close friends were the peple whom i knew since i was 5 i lost them too after changing schools and not keeping in contact i hate myself when someone actually tries to go out of their way to socialize with me and then i act weird im pretty sure i give off creepy vibes wherever i go im referred to as the shy person in my class im in my 12th grade right now and about to chose a career path that requires me to not go to college this makes me feel its going to get even worse and i might end up being old with no one to check on me with no youthfus experiences and relationships how am i even supossed to fix this change my personality also i have no idea where to even be social after my 12th grade ends i mostly just go to the gym and paint alone in my room,post-pandemic
i feel like as a person i am way too sensitive and fragile i get hurt easily i cling too hard to impossible things and give up on that which is within my reach if i am ever anywhere but my bedroom alone i am out of place i feel like with my mind i am just not made for this as ive gotten older life has only gotten more stressful i am more emotional and easily hurt and there is a lot more hurting taking place it feels like my future is so far out of my reach i dont even know what it is maybe this is not entirely bpd but just a general person feeling the world just sucks no one knows what theyre doing etc etc but it genuinely feels like i cant do this edit i just want to thank everybody for being here making a random reddit post late at night i did not expect to gain this much attention at all it is sad to see people in rough situations like me too but it is also so uplifting to see how supportive and kind everyone is and i am so glad everyone is sharing their own thoughts and experiences i have been feeling so alone lately and maybe its shallow but just seeing all you people commenting here have made me very happy thank you everyone and know that i support you and i will be here if you ever want someone to talk to,pre-pandemic
apologies for my punctuation im not very good with it ive always been obsessed with the inner workings of my mind and finding a way to get better but when i research a disorderillness and it seems to connect dots to me i want to bring it up the issue is my family tends to take the opportunity of me doing this and use it to their advantage by saying hypochondriac or im just looking for more symptoms to add when that is far from the truth for example before i starting writing this post i was watching a video on visual show syndrome a disorder where someone will see something like tv static in their vision this caught my eye all my life ive had vision troubles far sighted astigmatism etc but i never thought about how seeing floaters or the static in my vision could be something completely different than my failing vision i would like to bring it up to my doctor the next time i see her im just fearful my familys affect on her will sway her opinion even if this isnt what im going through i want to make sure that im not overlooking it or ignoring it ive had similar trouble with my mental health as well im mainly looking for advice on how to bring these discoveries up to my doctor or psychiatrist,post-pandemic

tw mention of abuse i know a girl who is still friends with my ex who seriously physically and verbally abused me for years but she can forgive him for this because hes fun to hang out with she knows and ive sent her recordings of him screaming profanities at me and hitting me but somehow thats forgivable because again theyve been friends for so long she also was surprised that i didnt forgive him for doing these things i also know of many friends who have remained friends and had fights that involve serious stuff like name calling being super angry and hurt calling each other bitch and other worse names and yet if there is a genuine apology they have a good chance of making up and being friends again in the end however when it comes to methings are very different its like i have fewer chances than other people or im starting out at a lower level it doesnt matter how healthy the friendship is or how long it lastsi can have the healthiest most stable friendship ever and have the friend tell me it is these things so its not just like that in my head for years but if we have a single fight and its my fault it is utterly irredeemable the friendship is over forever example lets say i have a mental breakdown and put too much pressure on someone to be there for me and cry about how much im hurting and then block the person and then unblock them a couple days laterwell goodbye forever thats unforgivable without even calling them names ive done something completely irredeemable compared to all these other people who seem able to forgive and forget much worse things from their friends it doesnt make sense to me im also wondering if its possible to be manipulative which is kind of the keyword for us no without meaning to and actually while meaning to be utterly sincere like in an apology i wrote an apology to my former best friend and i thought it was completely genuine i thought it was an excellent apology straight from the heart but ive just been informed that it was completely manipulative and selfish im so confused you can look at my post history if you want details on my situation but honestly i think ive been told enough times today how much i suck and how much i am manipulative so mostly id really like to hear from other people if you have experienced a similar phenomenon of being less forgivable than other people,post-pandemic
i noticed that one thing that i dont do nearly enough in this sub is relate to actually absorb the thoughts of the people who post and comment i think that irl other parts of the internet and even other parts of reddit i get so caught up in managing the symptoms and pitfalls of my whirlwind clusterfuck in the moment brain that i can just come here to dump sometimes it just feels like ill be able to get through the week better if i just shamelessly announce yes i have that too probably worse i dont know how i deal but after getting some thoughtful replies to comments this weekfrom people who like me sometimes just glance off the intended point of the conversation who like me go in some random direction right at the end so close to finishing a thought the way they intended thats when i had to admit that i wasnt serving myself best by just simply venting after the blackout to protest the awful freedom sucking regulation called sopatheotherone this has become one the most thoughtfully moderated subs that i am proud to point people to on reddit replete with a truly broad set of people from the notquiteableto escape the oppression which is public high school to those successfully pursuing post graduate degrees the mature to the relatively young those strong enough pick up others who are down to those so immobilized with anxiety that they cannot anticipate how they are going to get their next meal there girls and guys hyperactive and inattentive the hilariously irreverent and the strangely morbid vetarans and undiagnosedbutsearching as well as genuinely interested parents and boyfriends and girlfriends anyway i hope to be able to get a better feel for some of you because in some ways a help group can be better than any one perfect book or analogy or video though if you get the opportunity try to get through the 30 min barkley video in the faq 1 3 tgg,pre-pandemic

all the time out in public i feel like people are staring at me and judging me negatively i feel like my body language just screams punch me and my face is just extremely deadpan i cant look people in the eyes and when i do especially for extended periods i get irrationally disastrously uncomfortable and confrontational i feel like the only good conversations i can have is if im cowering in a way or talking about my problems anything that gives the person im communicating with power i can never out shine or out perform someone without feeling like people are judging me or thinking i think im better every minute thing that could be negative in everything i say or do i tend to think of all of it and think im being judged to my standard i hardly know how to be there for someone else when they are having a hard time cause that would require me to be the strong one and give advice but i dont feel like im good enough or just insecure and inadequate to give them advice its so unbelievably draining i spend literally 99 of my time alone in my room watching tv and scrolling which probably explains my frustrations but ive been out in the world and with people and even had friends but the work to keep those friendships and the standards i set for myself only i just couldnt live up to them and ive ghosted everyone i know a lot of these feelings are completely irrational but idk if im alone on this or just a lost cause,post-pandemic
today im having the type of day where everything you can think of makes you feel sad and depressed right from the moment you wake up i think about moments in the past and question myself i shouldve replied this to her why didnt i do that or why didnt i stand up for myself more or why did i say that they must think im a weirdo but also every person i interact with i feel like they dislike me or that they dont think im interesting because whenever i talk to anyone they look away or get distracted i always end up questioning myself why am i like this why does this happen to me am i the only one i have a few friends but i would say theyre more acquaintances because i feel like i cant tell them private things theyre more like the type of friends you hang out with once in a while and do things with and have small basic chitchats with nothing on a deeper level whenever meeting them up i do feel a lot of anxiety afraid of being judged missing out hearing their stories afraid of getting hurt or humiliated i also avoid going to parties birthdays weddings or events with more than 5 people especially when i dont know anyone because i feel like everyone is watching me paying attention to every move stutter mistakes i make and afraid they judge me for it i developed severe social anxiety from being bullied in high school it fucks you up when the bullying started i isolated myself more and more and found comfort on the web this isolation made me miss experiences in life the first few teenage years i didnt really mind as time progressed and i got older i realised i was missing out on experiences and felt like i didnt improve as a person but others did especially at my age i just turned 27 and each birthday i feel like crying because i didnt get to enjoy my life the way i wanted to missed out on experiences because i have no one to do these with everything you do it involves interacting with people and it scares me to death still i visited a few therapists had a few sessions but i still have so much anxiety sometimes i feel like it will never go away anyways i dont know exactly why im posting this maybe its because im on my period and super emotional and i feel like theres no one i can actually talk to about this like a friend so i find comfort here but also knowing im not the only one having these issues makes me feel im not alone in this because some days i really do feel like a freak and that im the only one suffering from this or having issues or thoughts like this so if you made it all the way to the end of this post and you feel like you want to get something of your chest or you want to share some tips or advices or you want to support and share love please do you will help me and hopefully others too thankyou 3,post-pandemic

hey listen i have been where you have been im 27 years old and in the past year ive had the following symptoms twitching all over my body numb arms in the morning such blurry vision i couldnt read the computer dizziness i constantly felt drunk yellow shits with bits in purely from worry and anxiety anxiety makes your digestion super fast stomach ache spasming stomach bloating which was so uncomfortable constant acid reflux a white covered tongue inability to think unable to concentrate completely zoned out like a zombie heart jumps and scares bloodshot eyes chest tightness and pain headaches migraines with aura ear ache ringing in my ear crawling sensation in my ear ulcers like all the time felt weak eg in the gym nausea back pain joint pain jittery jaw involuntary jaw moving swollen lymph nodes numbness and tingling down one side of face as a result of this i had the following tests 1 mri about 30 blood tests diabetes thyroid full blood count you name it ive had it about 5 stool tests 1 ecg 2 emergency hospital rushes 1 xray ears checked multiple times saw an ent specialist twice saw a neurology specialist had an oral cancer screening have a single tonsil up had a mole checked got a lump in my tongue checked definitely had more than this too paid privately for screenings and all sorts im from the uk so healthcare is free ive convinced myself ive had the following illnesses at times ms lymes disease skin cancer oral cancer bowel cancer a stroke brain tumor heart attack etc etc guess how many things i had wrong with me zero i was worried about a few things one was a lump in my tongue which the doctor said was fine and now ive learnt to accept that they are right im still here i still have the lump everything is okay and its the same for you the best things you can do to help yourself are 1 do not fucking google ever i stopped googling about 2 months ago been 100x better ever since has google ever helped you identify a killer disease nope didnt think so 2 try to be rational the best thing you can do if you think something is wrong is tell yourself okay i have found this what is the most likely cause the most likely thing is that it is something benign okay then i will wait for 2 weeks and then go to the doctor 99 times out of 10 it will be gone 3 realise that you have to do this yourself ignore your subconscious mind and take control of your thoughts are you going to honestly let your own brain control how you feel for the rest of your life take the time to take control now its honestly completely in your control take a moment and consider what you are doing there are two people in your head your conscious self if you choose to think something and your unconscious self which is there doing its own thing the unconscious self will make you think things are wrong with you but you need to take control and not let it control you as soon as you let yourself think you have something your body will feel as if you have it it sounds dumb as fuck but you need to choose to be healthy choose that you are okay because by choosing that youre not okay shock youre not okay every single one was manifested by myself cos i allowed myself to get so worked up and stressed 4 look after yourself sleep exercise etc will help i had a vitamin d deficiency which was definitely contributing to my anxiety get a test for that if you dont get much sun almost everyone is deficient in it heck take a low dose regardless the placebo effect might help 5 think about the past how many times have we been though this how many times have you had a deadly infections disease are you dead no why because the average life expectancy is like 80 years old 6 believe your doctor how many times have you seen a doctor how many times were they right but they only looked for one second they must be doing a bad job no theyve just seen whatever youre showing them 39728364 times before they know what good looks like if they were worried they would look for longer these people are medical professionals because they love people including you 7 think about the future would you rather spend the rest of your life no matter how

go and live 8 dont fucking google just incase you didnt read the first time 9 talk to people more people have anxiety than you think almost everyone above like 25 has been anxious or depressed therapy is good get it if you can but ultimately its up to you to take control and make yourself healthy 10 stop checking stuff poking prodding opening touching all makes things dirty swollen irritated whatever is wrong with you will not go away if you keep fucking touching it apply a rule to yourself like i will leave it alone for 2 weeks and then go to the doctors that will help you to filter things that do and dont matter more easily finally oh and i am not a medical professional and nothing ive written is medical advice you should listen to what your doctor tells you which i am guessing is that you have anxiety which is why youre on here searching for answers you wont find them here nor will you find anything wrong with you go and enjoy your life go socialise make a stand like i said i dont have anxiety anymore i stopped one day and said fuck this im choosing to not have this anymore and its gone its a state of mind and you can control your own brain if tou choose too if you want

thought process that everyone else uses honestly stop googling and start living 3 year update wow where did that time go life has never been better i dont panic about my health i dont obsess or check

this has just been on my mind constantly for the past week and would like to just dump it somewhere i acknowledge i might have done some dumb things and am actively learning from them i just think writing it down somewhere and have people listen and possibly support would be nice please let me know your stories if you experienced anything similar ive had anxiety for as long as i can remember i was sexually active with 2 other girls previously and i had erectile dysfunction with both of them the first time as well when i couldnt get hard they blew me and that would help me a lot since ive been dating around ive noticed that whenever i make out with a girl i dont get hard anymore i thought maybe its because i was in a relationship for 3 years so im just used to it turns out it was probably anxiety i met a girl recently and we hit it off on the third date we were naked and about to have sex and im so nervous i could not get it up my plan b in this situation is to ask for a blowjob because that has helped me in the past but she was like no i hate doing that i was like okay and i try to go down on her to not leave her unsatisfied and she just pushes me off and tells me we dont have to force it so we just start cuddling she gives me a massage to try to relax me and i try to give her one back but according to her i suck at massages so shes like nevermind i dont want a massage anymore this really puts me in my head i started to get worried as fuck that i was going to disappoint her and drank some whiskey in front of her which might have not been the best move she might have thought damn this guy needs to drink to sleep with me i offered her some and she said no thanks i was really hoping it would help with getting hard but no luck i just told her straight up like hey just know its not personal i have general anxiety disorder probably too much information and this has happened to me in the past with new people i tried to not make a big deal out of it but she could probably sense i felt pretty insecure about it we kept it casual and we talked about music and movies for a bit i tried to escalate again but she was like chill we dont have to force it again after like 40 mins she had to go since she worked early i kept it light and casual and walked her to her car and kissed her goodbye and told her it was as fun as always i text her a couple days after showing a picture i took of my friend im a photographer and she responds the next day like haha you really know how to take pictures and im like haha thanks maybe i can give you your own photoshoot and shes like okay when and im like tuesday and no response tuesday rolls around and im like yo sooo can you make it today and shes like no i work late today sorry and i just go okay any time youre free around 4 this week silence i wait a day and a half and then i send her silence i really liked her and i felt we had a great connection i feel like i fucked everything up i started going to hypnotherapy for anxiety and ed and i do feel like my anxiety is reduced overall and i feel more sexually potent in general im meditating every day now maybe its a blessing in disguise because im actually actively working to resolve my anxiety instead of just ignoring it however when i see sex in a movie or sex is mentioned now i feel so bad because it reminds me of what happened i stopped jerking off to porn for a week because i cant stand to look at people do what i could have done in real life i kind of had to make myself confront it because i dont want to be scared of sex forever,post-pandemic

honestly this happened to me if you read my posts youll know im mostly recovered from having panic attacks and worrying about everything 6 months without a major panic attack woohoo ive come a long way with keeping on top of my diet exercising regularly and forcing myself to be social with family and friends but ive been crazy happy the last couple of days due to finally quitting a job that made me miserable feeling confident and happy to be social and chat more to friends im not used to feeling anymore than content for a few hours so to feel ecstatic for a few days made me feel like i was going crazy haha it goes to show im not used to any emotions in their extremes including happiness i feel like true comfort is being in a meh mood after talking to a therapist in the past about this its actually very common chronic anxiety disorders basically put all your energy into coping with one extreme emotion and when you recover it sometimes unveils a tendency to feel very uncomfortable with emotions you did not previously express like anger confidence and happiness and was actually a trigger for one of my relapses i was convinced i was an aggressive person that was dangerous because in around 10 years of my youth i did not express anger not because it was repressed but because anxiety was my default reaction to everything im not an angry person and after a lot of cbt ive come to accept all emotions that make us unique and often very confused people im allowed to be happy im allowed to be angry and anxiety is ok in small doses too,pre-pandemic

ive been reading posts here and i joined the discord for a few days i noticed some really serious issue being brushed off and blamed on adhd i read about a girl who was randomly messaging her friends and having freak outs at them for no reason she said there was no reason just a way to direct her adhd energy im reading about intense depression and moments of extreme emotion instability etc adhd might make these worse but the intensity and complete lack of control described in some of these postsconversations seem like either its the worst case of adhd in existence or real depression or bpd being worsened by the adhd brain if it is the latter then you need to get help or work on improving those other issues a common theme in these posts is that the op comes to the conclusion of oh im having psychotic freak outs just my adhd brain i think that these sort of mentalities get dangerously close to making their whole identity revolve around adhd if you blame every problem and every freak out on adhd it leaves little room to improve i understand that the adhd brain works differently but it is a functioning human brain many people with adhd are incredibly smart you can improve and you can get help im sorry if this is hard to read for some people but these really worry me and i thought id maybe make a post in hopes that at least one person benefits from it edit grammar and spelling,pre-pandemic

hello all id like to talk to you about my lover whom im worried for i feel like hes a special bad case and id like to know if any of you have some advice or know similar persons or tell me if i can keep hope hes now 35 but hes deep deep into drugs since hes 16 a few years ago he spent 2 years in jail where he didnt have access to anything which saved his life from his own words now he takes ketamine cocaine andor crack every day psychedelics or mdma once a week and of course weed all day everything he takes is in high high dosage he says he started with 6gr shrooms when he was 16 and did not come down every since now he takes sometimes between 10gr to 16gr shrooms every time and says his brain is wired in a way that he can handle and need high dosages he took like at least 400 acid tabs in his life god knows how much shrooms at this point and thousands and thousands viles of k weirdly enough hes mentally okay hes physically fit and looking good but his cheeks are marked by crack hes such a sweet and kind heart and he made me be in love in a way ive never been before though i knew from the beginning hes a very special guy in a very special situation from the first day he told me everything about his situation his lifestyle and addiction he has no money and is not planning to work hes a financial burden to his family and friends he relies on them to get food to get fuel to get substances i still struggle to understand how people around him get him all this stuff for free as nothing is really free in this world but hes friend with big dealers that have unlimited access to these things hes lucky in a way for now as hes still supported otherwise i guess hed just be in the streets i also take drugs and i have a strong psychonautic interest for what they bring and the experimental metaphysical experience it offers so we kind of bonded around that between other things but im nowhere close to what he is im not addicted i mostly do it for experiences and though i can also do intense phases of consuming stuff at high dosage i can stop anytime i tried everything he tried but never crack he says he will never give this poison to people he love and never offered me which i think is a respectful sign so obviously i think he needs to calm down on drugs the problem is that he defines his whole personality around it and romanticises it he says the problems in his life are only due to the poor quality of the drug he gets and everything would be solved if he could take high quality stuff everyday when he speaks this way i panic and get scared like its not good to think this way i dont think sermoning or moralising would be of any use but i do believe love and affection can help show him happiness can also be found through other ways we dont live in the same country we met last summer and had a summer of love since then we talk everyday and im gonna go back see him soon for a few months i feel i cant do much at a distance but im really looking forward to going back to him just being present for him so what im thinking is to start step by step the first thing he should stop is crack as its the one thing he hates he says its devil drug and wants to stop but feels unable hes ashamed of smoking crack and i saw his truth one day when he was in a comedown crying and saying hes stuck in this shithole the fact that he showed me this face and has the will to stop gives me hope i know it all starts with will so im optimistic for that but im a bit worried for the rest though shrooms k acid md are not devil drug as ccrack is his way of consuming is absolutely not normal and dangerous my problem is the romanticising speech he has towards these it sounds like he doesnt see anything wrong to taking these every day and in such quantities he doesnt seem to realise that all his problems money family etc derivates from this ive always been a drug lover and i myself always had an abnormaly strong interest for drugs and ive been excessive too but this goes beyond and its my first time facing a hard case of addiction im really learning what addiction means and i had no idea thats a lesson for me as such now im even a bit pissed sometimes at drugs because though you can have incredible metaphysical experiences i feel its an endless pit and you can just get lost in exploration without even getting so much out of it in the end just making your life be torn apart the seek is endless i love him and i believe in god hes less expressive but i think deep down he loves me and also believes in god i think love god are hands that can help someone get out of anything in life but it only works if he has the will too and problem is that he has the will to stop crack good but not the will to reduce the rest so probably he should focus on stopping crack for now and then the rest will depend on his free will i dont want to change him as such i loved him as he is so for now i dont interfere too much as i dont want him to be pissed and turn his back on me but because i love him i just wish he could attain a more reasonable way of consuming from time to time we have a debate and i gently express that i dont think its a viable way but i usually get a bit despaired by the delusional speech he answers me i just cant wait to go back there as i am hoping that we can isolate in a bubble of love like we did last time of course well take stuff together but im hoping that we can have more quality experiences so that he sees theres no need to compulsively taking every day hell probably always take stuff so im ready to accept that but i just hope hell reach a more reasonable way of consuming also its hard for me to know how to position myself towards him in a way i am complicit when i dont say anything or when i take with him but when i tell him bluntly theres a problem he doesnt really seem to understand i feel i should just be there be loving gentle and hope that experiencing love will prove him there are other ways to appreciating life last few days we were together we didnt take anything just made love all the time and he told me it was the first time in a long time that he didnt take drugs except smoking for a few days and that the only moments he didnt need that was when he received such love and affection so that also gives me hope thank you if you read me towards here not sure what i ask for but any reaction or advice or help or testimony would be welcome to guide me in that situation im a resolute optimist and idealist and i pray everyday i hope theres hope but your help would be welcome,post-pandemic
i was diagnosed bipolar and adult adhd like two months ago im 38 male and spent all this time thinking i was a freak so finally getting a diagnosis was life changing for me heres my problem though im happily married and with my wife for 15 years i think my wife is the most beautiful and perfect woman ive ever been with my wife has pcos and as such her libido is not exactly normal this isnt normally a problem at all i understand this about her and accept her no matter what shes my best friend and i want her to feel comfortable however since our passionate moments are not super frequent i get super ready to go i hit on her obsessively during these times and make a ton of innuendo obviously she gets exasperated with me and i can tell it pushes her away and kinda makes her say no she said something today that really bothered me not because it was insulting or anything like that it bothers me because i dont have a good answer she said are you sure this isnt a hypersexual episode for a minute i was taken aback how can i tell the difference i think my wife is just the sexiest and am almost always interested in sharing passionate moments with her when we are together intimately all my stress and worries disappear i get to just be with my best friend and all the negative feelings and self doubt disappear its like the calm of a hurricanes eye it heals my soul how do i tell if its a hypersexual episode or if i genuinely just want to be intimate with my wife because i love these times with her,post-pandemic
weve been doing emdr and i had a very traumatic childhood during emdr when i found things particularly stressful or anxious id find my mind went to a health worry she believes that the compulsions are a coping mechanismdistraction from dealing with bad things i questioned this because the ha is so awful how could it be a coping mechanism and she likened it to how some people use drugs and alcohol to cope and this is also bad can anyone relate to anything im saying here if shes correct then it feels hopeful as maybe i can focus on coping mechanisms to replace this one but im sceptical as none of it makes sense to me,post-pandemic
i feel like i have a few drinks and then my brain starts thinking that everyone hates me and no one loves me and i get rlly in my head when im drunk and alone is it the alcohol bringing out symptoms i rlly just want to be able to enjoy a few drinks and go home and be okay be i go home and spiral so this means i just normally end up staying out or getting more intoxicated at home and i just cant find a balance,post-pandemic
i know that personalities can differ but i cant help thinking that im really different from others in a negative way its hard for me to connect with people while those around me do it so effortlessly even the ones that seem quiet still socialize better than me they consistenly make new friends and people dont seem to have an issue with their personalities afraid of missing out and being left alone i desperately try to look and behave as normal as possible i ditch my old habits and way of thinking i pay attention to what normal people are doing their social medias their way of talking and many more it might seem so ingenuine but i just want to be accepted by society i dont wanna be a weirdo anymore,post-pandemic
im on a week break from school right now and i dont really have anything planned to do at all for this week it gives me a lot of anxiety that i just have nothing to do all day it just makes me feel like im a lazy person because i dont have the motivation to do anything because i dont have school homework or plans what are some things i could do to distract myself from this,post-pandemic
so i was standing in line at the pharmacy yesterday picking up an albuterol inhaler and some prescribed extra vitamins for my girlfriend who is almost 9 months pregnant due in 7 weeks that she needs to keep her levels good and as a recovering heroin addict its been a little under 14 months clean for me and at this point in my life its changed so drastically half the time i dont even notice the things i used too people obviously buying drugs needles on the ground and getting triggered whatever it may be 14 months ago i was in a jail cell throwing up myself from heroin wd while having benzo wd seizures and here my life is today its like that wasnt even my life do any of you ever get that feeling like damn i actually used to do all that stuff for a shot of dope but no need to reexplain my story its been told so im standing in line and a guy walks up next to me and asks if he can buy two 10 packs of 29 gauge needles obviously very drug addicted with his girl standing 30 feet away all sweaty and just you know that that person is addicted to dope look anyways the pharmacy tech said all we have is 29 gauge and he goes thats fine thats fine i just need two 2 packs now in my state pharmacies are required to sell up to 5 10 packs of needles and give free narcan if asked and i just kind watched and listened do his transaction pacing back and forth and it hit me ah ha that feeling where you think you yourself my god am i grateful for the life im able to live today and not be that guy anymore because 14 months ago i was that junkied out guy buying needles at the pharmacy but it gave me one of the most gratifying feelings ive ever felt blessed grateful happy whichever word you wanna use i felt it knowing i was going to go back to my car pickup dinner for my pregnant girlfriend and i and bring it back to our home knowing i wasnt going to wake up sick tomorrow it just in that moment for some reason made me feel so grateful im no longer in that grip of addiction like that that i almost teared up i have super bad anxiety and im super nervous to even post this because im afraid im but doing it i also in no way am saying ha sucks for that guy if i could i wish i could walk up to him and say hey man i can help you into detox you dont have to live like this but we all know we dont get clean unless we are personally truly ready so i guess i just wanted to make a gratitude post and let anyone and everyone know that is still struggling in active addiction just getting clean going through wd right now it gets better i promise im living proof with the iv habit i had i should be dead 5 times over but im here to make this post getting clean was the hardest choice i ever had to make and i had to hit a bad rock bottom to get clean for myself and its not easy if you can medically detox yourself please please do if you cant even if its just to get through the worst of the wdd have a suboxone or 3 on hand and maybe some clonidine or a low low dose of a benzo for the sleeplessness and rls will help tremendously we are all here for you the hardest part subsides physically within a week maybe 2 the mental part will always be an uphill battle but always a battle worth fighting this sort of turned into a rant just from seeing a guy buy needles that made me feel grateful i never have to do that again but if this reaches even 1 person im happy its hard i dont sugar coat things its not easy but the rewards you reap by getting clean and changing and building a new life are unimaginable we can and do recover happy holidays everyone merry christmas eve,pre-pandemic

i havent been able to find much information about this online so im reaching out to this community i have sexual trauma from a couple years ago and it has been getting worse recently one of the worst symptoms is that when my boyfriend touches me i just cant handle it sometimes it doesnt even have to be in a sexual way even if were just cuddling ill suddenly become aware of his hands on me and i have this feeling thats hard to describe its an awful combination of disgust and anger i can still feel it after he stops and moves away from me and it makes me want to rip my skin off in that area it makes me feel bad because hes always respectful of my boundaries and i trust him completely but these episodes still happen randomly sometimes they last for a full day after it happens and its hard for me to even take a shower because being naked makes me uncomfortable even if its just me by myself i have obsessive thoughts about the trauma that are so vivid i can almost feel it happening again i feel really weird about it and the fact that i havent been able to find anything online makes me feel worse can anyone relate thanks,pre-pandemic
i have always heard how if one is suffering they should reach out so i reached out to my parents after a meltdown its been years since i am in depression nd suicidal nd have anxiety issues i dont share the best relationship with my parents but some part of me still had hopes from them anyway yesterday i cried all day trying to explain to them my situation but they said i am lying nd i have no reason to be depressed about my own parents told me if i am depressed then i probably want to kill myself too so y dont i do it if i really am depressed great solution actually now i might as well go ahead nd do it finally maybe i wont be a liar anymoremaybe i can finally find peace,pre-pandemic
okay i want to get other peoples perspectives on this so basically i have an orchestra concert in an hour and we just had our sound check so currently we are all waiting until its time for the concert to start i was just now sitting with some of my peers not exactly talking to them but in their presence then someone else walked up to where we were and invited the group to go out to lunch both people i was sitting with ended up getting up and going heres where my question comes into play i thought about going with them but for some reason i started questioning myself wondering if i was really invited the person who invited the group didnt direct the invitation to specifically the other two people it was directed at the whole group which makes one part of me think i was welcome to come too but the other part of me doesnt know if this was something they had talked about earlier and had already established as a group im not super close with any of these people i just happen to be in orchestra with them they seem like wellintentioned decent people who i assume wouldnt leave anyone out on purpose my parents are always telling me to get out there and take these kinds of opportunities when i can and a part of me really wants to but another part of me doesnt want to insert myself into things that im not invited to i think theres a difference between leaving someone out on purpose and sticking to your already established social group if that makes sense idk im probably overthinking this and i probably couldve gone with those people and had a great time i wish i could just do these things without overthinking btw sorry for the wall of text im on mobile so the formatting probably isnt the best,post-pandemic
so i recently got diagnosed with bpd after getting an initial diagnosis of depression and anxiety a year ago i found this sub and thought id share this here im not sure if this is affiliated with bpd or not but ive noticed its really hard for me to express myself clearly and say what i mean in verbal context ill have something i want to say in my head itll be clear to me but once im actually trying to vocalize these thoughts its just like verbal diarrhoea i dont know if im overthinking this close friends and family have spent so much time with me that i think they understand the points im trying to make but i always feel like im not able to actually accurately communicate how i feel its really frustrating because i hear people speak effectively around me all the time and it just makes me overly conscious about my own speaking abilities which just makes me spiral even more texting has always been my preferred way of communicating cause i feel like writing things down gives me the chance to review what im saying and fine tune it to accurately convey whats going on in my head,pre-pandemic

recently i bit the bullet and went to see a psychiatrist for an adhd diagnosis ive been a high performing student most of my life but have always had teachers suggest that i had adhd at home my inattentiveness led to me spending too much time on school work and having much of a life outside from that on the first visit he agreed based on my history and subjective complaints that i might have adhd i took an exam which involved a few questionnaires and a computer test im not sure if it was a continuous performance test but it was a 15 minute exam that involved pressing space if letters appeared on screen with a few exceptions i enjoyed the test perhaps a bit too much on the next appointment my doctor said that my results were such that i didnt even qualify for subclinical adhd anyone have a similar experience frankly its left me feeling adrift and wondering if what ive experienced my whole life is my own problems rather than as a result of adhd addendum thanks for all the comments a few things i forgot to mention my psychiatrist had me take the test to see if i needed to take stimulant medication,post-pandemic

99 of the posts on this sub are of people panicking and in need of immediate reassurance that theyre okay i suppose thats the nature of health anxiety but it makes for a stressful online environment without any real growth i would love to see this sub dedicated more towards recovering from ha and supporting real progress rather than just applying bandaids after all seeking and receiving reassurance is actually harmful and makes ha worse in the long run we need more success stories no matter how small methods for distracting from ha temporary solutions methods for confronting ha longterm solutions sharing advice from therapists personal reviews of antianxiety medications posts updated with outcomes posts about developing and maintaining good physical health community challenges weekly success threads so many of us engage in unhealthy behaviors that will inevitably lead to the disease we so dread so many of us worry about nonpreventable disease that we forget to do what we can to prevent preventable disease so many of us have a selfdefeating mentality that we will always struggle with ha and that theres nothing to be done about it but suffer through it but there are steps to take healthy habits to practice and real solutions to address the root of our anxiety and this subreddit should be a hub for that kind of supportive information a beacon of hope for people who cant stop worrying about their health and need practical tangible help lets not wallow lets do the work together can we hold each other accountable for unsafeunhealthy behaviors check up on each other be more intentional with our posts can we cultivate a culture of real healing rather than just putting out endless fires edited to add more bullet points,pre-pandemic
constant internal dialogue in my head super duper judgemental ive done a lot of work to decrease the amount of negative self talk i have and its worked extremely well i hype myself up now and am making healthier choices for me and the people around me im not cured or whatever though whenever i get upset that negative inner voice is just screaming at me mocking my healthier side for thinking that its gotten better and being delusional i just get so fucking angry at myself for still being upset or conflict averse or shutting down or dissociating and like i just want to cry so hard i feel sick sometimes yknow,post-pandemic

i noticed that my health anxiety gets worse every single day so in conclusion that would mean the ha influences itself i dont know how it is for everyone else but for me there seems no other particular reason that makes my ha worse when im actually sick it gets worse for a while but the constant rising of the anxiety around it doesnt really have an explanation other than the brain just thinking more and more about tge health and being aware of every little change in the body does anyone has thoughts or knowledge about it or does anyone experience it differently,post-pandemic
sorry if this is not the right place i just am not sure where might be and looking for advice i was diagnosed with ptsd when i was 19 years old now 28 due to situations i placed myself at uni and living away i have had therapy on and off for anxiety and depression since and it mainly has really worked supporting me i honestly believed until recently i didnt have any sort of ptsd since the age of 21 i have had 4 relationships 2 really good relationships including the one k am in currently but then 2 propped horrid ones one relationship i was in i was sexually assaulted and then later found out he was on the sex offenders register the second rubbish relationship he was very clearly a narcissist manipulated me to constantly feel like i was worth nothing gaslighting me and denying he had a child for a year to only announce he had a child when i said i was going to possibly propose to him his sister had messed me on face book 2weeks into our relationships telling me he had a child i would have been fine if he just told me the truth other things like saying how my family and friends hated me and when i final got the balls to break up with him he told me i will just find another rich lady to look after me which made me have a true wake up call anyway i have been with my current partner for almost 3 years and although both of us have had hard times we are solid as a relationship and as a team he is aware of im intimacy issues sometimes due to the sexual assalt and making sure i dont get triggered by tv shows other things so we are good and i love him to the end of the earth i bumped into my ex narcissist at a work event i have to attend once a month job center plus event if you are from the uk which isnt just my company but loads of recruiters in one place out of politness i spoke to him as i couldnt really get away from it he was the same as he was before always trying to say he was one better than me i just stayed profeshal being in a work environment i wanted to be around him the least amount as possible immediately after this interaction i was shaking uncontrollably and felt i was going to have a anxiety attack so took myself out since i have spoken to my now partner about this and not thought much of it since the interaction i am increasingly more irritable triggered by minor things and am constantly having nightmare and waking up in hot sweets although my ex isnt doing much in my dreams hes keeping me from going places or i have been blocked off from my now partner with this my anxiety is supper high and im not sleeping much i am currently on the highest medication dose i can be on so i dont see that changing which my drs normally do when i have a mental health wobble although its been 3 years since i saw my ex and im now happy i am getting worried that i may have some ptsd or something similar coming back purly triggered by seeing my ex any suggestions on what this might be how long it might last or if i should seek support its been about 2 weeks now which is why im getting more worried i am also incredibly worried this may come a cycle if i continue to see him at events and maybe should speak to my manager,post-pandemic

looking for other people that have had anorexia for 5 years that have been in recovery the same amount of time or longer than they were active in their ed i had anorexia for 7 years and im 5 years into recovery ive only been able to find short term anorexia studies on weight restoration 1 year or less im just curious to see what its like when i reach the same amount of time recovered as i did in active ed im much better mentally than when i started but i still have bad days i think im hung up on the fact that my body when im intuitively eating and getting daily movement is still resting at a higher weight so i guess im hoping that once i reach year 7 in recovery ill have balanced out completely granted i also have crohns disease so that probably makes things more complicated can anyone with long term anorexia that has also been recovered a long time please share their experiences,post-pandemic

hey everyone first time posting on this sub i stumbled across it today and want to give any encouragement or hopefulness to anyone who is struggling with addiction long story short i was addicted to hydrocodone xanax and cocaine throughout high school and was arrested a week before my 18th birthday which saved me some serious jail time ive been sober now for 8 years next month have a wonderful wife 14 month old and we recently learned were expecting another child i just started my mba and seriously i still struggle with my demons but life is so much better than i could have imagined possible while i was in active addiction my advice or takeaway from my addiction is to ask yourself if youre trying to cover something up for me it was intense anxiety and depression i still struggle with that to this day but believe me there are far better ways to deal with these issues than masking them i workout daily meditate 30 minutes daily and go to therapy best of luck and blessing to anyone struggling feel free to reach out if you have any questions,pre-pandemic

my boyfriend 25m and i 24f both have eds and sometimes we eat together i think it especially helps him get the confidence to eat so i do it for him i think that he does want to recover and he just needs someone to reassure him and help him through it i care for him and i do it for him but it makes me nervous that i wont ever reach my goals i dont lie to him ive thought about it but i cant if he found out i was lying i think itd break him i just feel a little stuck he also doesnt like it when i exercise but i dont just exercise because i have an ed i exercise because i have chronic conditions that exercise is really the only treatment for and its one that has helped considerably he calls it exercise purging and sometimes thats what it is but other times i just wanna go on a walk or play a workout video because its something i enjoy that is especially if were going on walks together but it really triggers him i think because hes a lot more sedentary than me honestly i do feel a little like i could recover but i dont want to im just not ready yet recovery feels like giving up it feels like saying i couldnt do it i hate that feeling i guess ive decided to start exercising away from him and eating with him like i do with everyone he doesnt want me to lose anymore but i have to it feels like im risking our relationship but i dont know what else i can do this is important to me it doesnt matter if i have to lose slower i still have to lose i hope he understands when he finds out eventually,post-pandemic
she couldnt take on all the responsibilities i was balancing i was in this job for 3 years and it was incredibly high stress and high pressure i cried a lot i thought it was my bpd reducing my ability to cope but this shows that sometimes were not just overreacting actually some of us can probably deal with volatile situations quite well considering weve navigated them for most of our lives make sure you are not putting up with something that is feeding into creating more negative environments trust your gut sometimes how youre feeling is actually just completely justifiable edit thank you everyone for the support totally unexpected this is why i love the bpd community we all lift each other up you are all amazing,pre-pandemic

a year ago today at this moment i tried to take my life at this very moment 365 days ago i was in such a dark place that life seemed pointless in 9 hours a year will have passed since when i check into inpatient care it sucked i hated life i was in mental and physical pain but i kept pushing i went to iop and i was lucky enough to meet other teens who were succeeding in their path towards recovery after ten weeks of iop i graduated from the program and was on my own i started going to a adolescent sober living group and met people who instilled the idea of long term sobriety into my head it was sunshine and rainbows for six months i believe in aana they call that pink cloud around the six month mark i found out that a close friend of mine from iop was in jail a week later another one was missing a few days later one was in the hospital and finally the last kid from my original group killed himself it was just me i was the last one standing the ones i looked up to as role modes failed and i struggled but i found my passion in music again and was able to focus on people who dont struggle with substance abuse and who support me and my journey i found my way out of the first year and found that this is what i want to do with my life adolescent substance abuse counseling i am grateful for the year mark but also humbled by those i started this journey with and who arent with me now every second is a conflict every minute a fight every hour a battle and everyday a war and i will fight this for the rest of my life and i will win edit thank you guys so much for silver edit 2 wow i cant believe how much this has blown up i hope that someone read this who needed an extra push when they were struggling,pre-pandemic
i think my liking to toothpaste started during 2022 when we were in study camp we would brush our teeth 3 times aday after waking up having breakfast and dinner since i was always around with people i was concerned that my breathe would stink so i started eating a little amount of toothpaste after lunch or when i my mouth didnt feel fresh during those times it wasnt like a serious problem but i started doing alot more and my friends would started noticing and say it is weird but still i didnt stop after while it started to bother me bcz i would brush my teeth more often and feel a sight of discomfort when i didnt consume toothpaste atleast once every while i also like brushing my teeth because i like the flavour and feeling it gives and would use alot of toothpaste everytime and after we got out of our camp i thought it would wear off but its still the same i ate toothpaste right after i woke up or after any convenience i love to brush my teeth and would atleast eat 13 teaspoon of toothpaste everyday i think it has become an addiction at this point since i cant stop at any time i want to see if other people struggle the same but ive never seen anyone talk about it like this so please help or give advice if theres anything you know about it,post-pandemic
so i work in a fairly small work setting i work with only 4 other people usually i can do whatever i want without being noticed because im so good at maintaining my duties today like many other days i cried at my desk for a few seconds just to let out the stress ive been carrying for a few weeks now my therapist recently opened up their own practice which doesnt accept my current insurance and my replacement therapists copay had risen to the point where i cant afford it so i dont have access to therapy anymore i didnt think it would be obvious until today i thought crying periodically was normal my bosss boss has access to all the cameras at my job and apparently today she saw me crying at my desk for a few minutes and immediately pulled me aside into a conference room to ask if i was okay because i immediately confess anything to any authority figure ever i told her exactly what i was crying about which she needed a little more context to understand so i ended up telling her everything behind my reason for crying today she was unbelievably understanding and empathetic with me however after the situation ended which was at the end of the workday as our discussion became very long i felt embarrassment and shame for telling my boss about my personal life specifically all of the problems i have she was very receptive and respectful she never interrupted me once and listened to everything i said she comforted me when i cried now that i am at home i am tortured by this interaction i am afraid that she will think i am not a competent worker or that im messed up and need a lot of help i cant shake off the heavy feeling of shame from opening up to her even though i know that she cared a about everything i had to say why am i completely overwhelmed with shame as if im acting and i dont deserve help even though everything i said was completely true why do i feel so utterly undeserving of help i hope i am not alone in this,pre-pandemic
i just want to share my experience as i am trying to do better i am a 24 yr old girl and i know i have issues with drinking my fiance and i get drunk 23x a week during the weekend and that means shots beers and wine probably several shots a couple beers and a couple wine glasses it started as maybe br an every other week thing in college with my friends and fiance but now that we live together we do it every damn week ironically i use to drink more when i would get drunk but now i drink less each session but do it way more i get so bored if i dont do it on the weekends cos i feel like theres nothing to do thats as cheap as getting wasted at home during the work week i am so bored after working all day and watching pointless tv at night and bed by 9pm so when the weekend comes i wanna spend it drunk and fun the whole time thurs after getting off i start drinking most friday nights ive been drinking at night too and saturday its mimosas at 2pm and being mildly drunk until dinner when the liquor comes out it is always so much fun and makes playing games and shows so fun however i end up passing out every time because i dont eat a lot to make room for the alcohol i also have accidentally peed myself several times after passing out i dont crave alcohol or think i need it when i go out but i do want it when im home to cure boredom my situation isnt as terrible as some but i definitely use it to have fun i consider myself to be functional because i have never missed school or work due to drinking and would never get drunk the night before i know i would have to get up early or do something important like i know how to do it responsibly its never ruined any of my relationships with my family or fiance but i know i am hurting myself i lie to people and say i dont drink as much as i do but i dont hide alcohol or sneak it my fiance and i both wanna cut down its just so hard its hurting my body i have liver pain and my blood pressure is slightly elevated just went to the doctor and my thyroid is overactive it has to be the alcohol i am in such denial ive also gained 10 lbs from it over the years i need more things to do on the weekend,post-pandemic
my stupid head hurts all the time im exhausted i have some cold food in bread cheese chicken crisp forgot to buy breakfast bars i didnt have coffee today and i feel as dead as my nana whos been dead for like almost a year everything feels so bad i never really got over it i never had time to grieve my degree is so demanding i lied my way out a hospital stay in a way i think the nurse knew i was going to do something its only graze i dont wanna go to hospital i dont even know if ill be in uni on monday im so exhausted im grateful for the weekend but its not enough i dont wanna live like this i have to make it all stop i thought about presenting myself with a cut but only for strong pain killers i can get high from running out of codiene which seemed to boost me more than caffeine only because of the quietiapine i couldnt get high i want to drink alcohol i dont care i want it all to stop i need to rebook my room for next year but honestly i dont intend to live that long,post-pandemic
i was diagnosed as an adult and before i started medication i was a complete caffeine addict my caffeine use would ebb and flow from a low of maybe 400600mg a day to long periods where id average somewhere in the range of 12g of caffeine daily roughly equivalent to 1020 cups of coffee between my two morning coffees each with an extra espresso shot added my 400mg caffeine pills before lunch my caffeineheavy preworkout before my postwork gym session some kind of powdered caffeine drink mix after working out plus 46 extra cups of coffee thrown in there throughout the day i was consuming more caffeine than everyone i knew combined i found that it very subtly helped me get over that massive barrier ive always had to start a new work assignment i never had any digestion or sleep issues at least noticeable ones i know it lowers sleep quality even if you are able to get to bed on time after getting started on vyvanse my coffee use has dropped a lot i still have a cup of coffee in the morning and lunch but ive stopped with the extra espresso shot mixed in and most days i skip the caffeinated preworkout so id say im down to an average of 200400 daily ive heard dr barkley on youtube say that theres an association between adhd and caffeine consumption so im curious what all of your relationship is with the worlds most popular drug,post-pandemic

so my sister and i had a big fall out at new year and we were just discussing it now and she reckons that im very unwell and unstable because i apparently said some things that were very hurtful which i dont remember saying at all and can hardly believe i would have said because they make no sense is she gaslighting me or did i really say those things and i dont remember because i was unwell how am i supposed to know the difference usually shes pretty trustworthy and i thought we had a good relationship but she has been depressed and has long covid recently can i assume that her version is the accurate one its really devastating to me that i apparently said these things she wont believe that she misheard or that she misunderstood and insists that i must be quite unwell at the moment and she says that i need more medicine,post-pandemic
i was approached on friday by a nabour of mine in a full on episode break down im not sure if shes been diagnosed in the passed but i was with her as she come to me as someone she knows as a safe person for her completely unknown to me shes been watching me for the last 7 years from the window outside she lives in a block of flats next to me i have seen her in the street over the years i was trying to work out the situation i was in all in the moment as she was completey breathless couldnt speak seeing things voices ect i managed to get the situation under control pretty fast and we sat down and had a good chat for 3 or 4 hours while we were waiting for help to arrive from the ambulance she was telling me about the voices and other things she can see and hear ect and shes been awake for weeks not eating and scared i quickly changed the conversation to something positive once i listened to her she thinks shes been followed her phones being hacked and shes got 10000s of videos and photos on her phone of what she can seeand hear ect i had a quick look to show i was understanding her but its obviously all delusion again i changed the conversation to something positive now i need to ask some of you this ended at 6pm friday when i left for a weekend away i told her to come back and see me on monday afternoontomarrow and left her with doctors and ambulance crew she told me that she feels i am someone she sees in her mind as a safe person so i dont want to get seen with anyone who shes seeing as a bad person to her i must give her some sort of relief being someone who sees as good i quickly got the situation of her crisis under control as once the ambulance arrived it was almost like nothing had happened the story is abit longer than this but it was a full episode to her can anyone give me any advice how i can move forward obviously shes going to need some sort of medication or something out of my control should i even bother to approach her in the future or would i be better off waiting to see if she ever comes back over to me i dont want her to be someone i see when shes at full on crisis point only if i can help it but im happy to take advice from others living with this mental health condition thank you,post-pandemic

i get really stressed out with large amounts of people so i want to be able to find a daytime with the least amount of traffic but it cant be too late at night because im in chicago and its a bit more dangerous according to my friends also the bigger thing that stresses me out is feeling like im wasting time i am very structured with my routine and set things up religiously by the hour how can i sort of keep myself on schedule in the store so i dont walk in when its light out and leave when its dark i do try and keep a detailed list of items with me but i still worry a lot about finding the best deal and getting what i actually wantneed so i end up spending a lot of extra time inspecting everything thank you,post-pandemic
this happened to me today i was with my wife and motherinlaw who both know im bipolar and some family friends of theirs who im pretty sure dont know im bipolar and they were talking about someones kid and how the kid has been lashing out and harming other people and immediately one of them said oh i bet theyre bipolar it just pisses me off how people think they know what theyre talking about when they have no idea what is going on at all really part of me wanted to leave the room part of me wanted to tell them about actually being bipolar but i just sat there quietly and felt like an alien i was also wondering what was going through the minds of my wife and mother in law while their friends were saying this then my fatherinlaw came in and randomly suggested that another totally unrelated person was bipolar for some reason i have no idea why this popped into his head just a coincidence i guess but it just made me feel more isolated and like im keeping some secret that i really shouldnt have to keep anyway i guess im just venting thanks for reading,pre-pandemic

im coming close to 2 years sober and im not doing good my cravings are pretty intense and i think the main reason they are so intense is because my pleasure receptors and are totally fucked nothing makes me happy anymore i dont get excited about anything no matter what it is the only thing that used to make me happy was doing drugs getting drugs or really anything that involved drugs i cant figure out what to do about it does anybody have any advice when it comes to this does your brain ever go back to normal,pre-pandemic
im so overwhelmed last week the flashbacks were so bad the night before my shift im a server that i was awake all night and i wasnt able to call in needless to say i was not in a good head space of course that one day in particular was absolutely crazy at the restaurant and i was struggling to keep up my coworker asked me why i was so overwhelmed and said that i should have been handling this better so i not wanting to divulge my whole mental health history just joked that i must have partied too hard last night i thought i made it clear that i was kidding but i guess not because she started spreading it around that i wasnt able to perform my job and that i was falling apart when my supervisor came to talk to me i broke down crying and explained what happened now the coworker is accusing me of lying and i heard her and some other girls talking about how im incompetent at my job i cant do this anymore i understand making a hangover joke was probably in poor taste but considering were all college kids i thought it would go better than explaining the real reason just feel super demoralized and i hate myself for it why did i have to fall apart at work,pre-pandemic

hello all im mostly bipolar 2 but there are some autism symptoms in my family and im wondering if i exhibited one of those i never understood ceremonial award rituals i never walked across the stage and got my diploma i just left once i knew i completed hs and started planning a summer freshman semester lots of events like weddings and funerals are generally unpleasant for most people i think so maybe its just not liking big events but there are some public rituals i dont get and it seems like a waste of time to attend does anyone understand what im talking about here,post-pandemic
i dont make my own reddit posts but i feel like i need to for other people a little background im a psychotherapist weird i know who has a sad history of health anxiety sometimes cancer but mostly devastating neurological diseases when i was in graduate school and i had very hard internship at a hospital i remember my first now looking back panic symptom that was odd my vision was blurry hm at my first therapy job i noticed eye pain as well now looking back i was very stressed and the florescent lighting is trash but i researched and wouldnt you know it eye pain is an ms symptom im a white woman in my 20s uhoh thats the main demographic im in trouble i keep googling and as i see symptoms i start to get those symptoms they dont come and go they are constant my face on one side and my arm on one side are numb all the time 4am numb i cry all the time go to neurologists have many tests rack up bills no ms i see a psychiatrist was prescribed lexapro and within a few weeks my life is back to normal shouldnt say this was simple because i cried for months and would vomit every morning out of sheer panic but its behind me i take the meds for 3 years then decide i can stop i should note that in between this event and the next i had smaller events and went to doctors for them always was nothing but then a year later something happens one day i notice my hand feels weird its like my typing is clumsy i spend 4 hours on als forums reading peoples experiences i watch youtube videos of diagnoses oh no this is it my muscles start twitching uncontrollably i have cramps in my legs in my hands every day i cry all the time i plan my death i tell my fianc he should probably move on that we shouldnt have the wedding because the money would be better saved for care i go to the doctor he says i seem fine he reads my medical records and sees i have health anxiety says i can see a neurologist if i want but itll probably be a waste puts me back on lexapro my fianc also insists that i start therapy i believe its a waste because im dying but fine every morning i wake up nauseous sobbing hands cramped i read and read and read i see my hand is smaller on one side im wasting away i lose lots of weight and can barely do any work i see a neurologist practically crawling to the office because i feel so weak when she tests my reflexes they are hyper another symptom i immediately burst into tears she tries to assure me that a lot of young people and anxious people have hyper reflexes but im hearing none of it we schedule an mri and have a follow up in a month the weeks waiting for the medication to kick in are brutal everyone needs to know that ssris have bad side effects in the initial weeks including increased anxiety i know right you have to understand that it takes a long time to build in your system you have to be patient this is where the therapy comes in we used cbt which really maps out your greatest fears the likelihood of that outcome and your ability to cope with that outcome we look at the facts i am not a doctor this is incredibly rare surely i wouldve gotten worse by now i dont feel my hand is messed up when im drinking alcohol my favorite health anxiety hackdrink and see if you still have the problem lol i start doing yoga in my office even though i suck at it because i just want to feel better selftalk is very dangerous you need to watch the messages youre playing in your head i told myself i know it i know over and over again its like your own personal health anxiety flavored brain washing i changed it to it feels like it feels like and like my therapist said feelings arent facts the 247 panic stops but im still worried i follow up with my primary he says ive gained some weight back and look a lot better i see the neurologist again and she notes the same i was prepared mentally for this appointment with an agenda i said i trust you if you say i should get an emg i will if you think i shouldnt i wont she said consider this a clean bill of health i dont think you need an emg i give her a hug thank her for being so kind and move on with my life i am not allowed to google this anymore point blank period i thanked my friends for dealing with me during this time and now i just cope with some bummer side effects from the lexapro but i dont care i have my life back my therapy moved to twice a month and i still take the medication my muscles twitch sometimes and oh well not as much as before more evidence that it was stress related logic is your friend i hope that you can pull some nuggets from this post including how symptoms can seem very real and yet not be real ill leave you with this one of my dearest friends also a therapist said to me you know youre really smart so your anxiety is smart too of course it picked a disease that you cant easily prove you dont have fin,pre-pandemic

so this is a relatively long story i will try to abbreviate in 2022 i was going through a very rough patch with my husband we were discussing divorce and i was angry and cocky and suicidal i felt like the world was on my shoulders since i work full time and in nursing school 2 kids one under 4 and the other under 11 i was out of my mind manic and using a considerable amount of marijuana no other drugs previously diagnosed with depression and anxiety i took leave from my work and took time off of school and i was in an extreme manic episode without knowing i was bipolar 1 whatsoever i had kept myself quite functional i had lost my eldests father to suicide before they were over 3 and was a young mother to begin with partner and i lived together and both worked full time my parents were supportive with child care while we were working they lived nearby i never found myself in a position where i thought my motherhood was in question i was a very loving mother and my entire life was my child just needed family support when the father passed away i moved back in with said supportive parents as excepted it was a very difficult time and my undiagnosed bipolar in retrospect led to some very unhealthy coping mechanisms i stayed working i stayed loving i stayed an involved mother to my child at night i had the tendency to go out with friends or others and enjoyed having a good time you could call it partying but it was a weekend thing i enrolled my child in daycare after about 6 months and continued to work full time i read him 3 books a night and always tucked him in fed him breakfast ect actively played was a present mother parents knew where i was when i left and i always asked i didnt disappear for any period of time just would ask them to babysit when i had plans fast forward i met a great guy we got married child views partner as father and calls him dad few years later we have a child together just 2 regular people with 2 kids living in a home and i am just working my way through college trying to decide if i want to pursue med school or nursing i chose nursing but have been in college for about 10 years once halfway through my nursing degree is when the mania took over i felt as though my partner was emotionally abusive and i voiced it loud and clear to everyone and anyone who would listen he was upset about my marijuana habit he kicked me out i had my first suicide attempt failed he called the cops i lied and said i was fine police believed me and didnt continue to follow i moved back in with my parents and said everything i could about how horrendous my husband was decided i wanted to get away get my head straight i told my parents i was leaving for a few days my 2 children were with parents or father i was really going off the deep end but had no idea i met up with an old friend opposite sex and took a road trip during said road trip my mania quickly turned into psychosis i was eventually picked up for a 5150 and admitted to hospital as a jane doe in er my husband found me as did my parents i screamed and yelled about how i hated my husband and to get him away from me they gave me ketamine to calm me down but it just made my psychosis worse i was not okay i spent 12 days involuntary until i was dc i was out of acute pyschosis but completely manic and charismatic i dc to my parents home to find out my parents had filed for guardianship of my oldest i flipped why would they be doing this i immediately gave up folded went into a mixed state once they had the temporary guardian ship i officially ran away i spent 45 days taking out a loan spending about 20k pushing my entire family and friends away essentially destroyed my life in a way only a manic person really can it all ended when i told my husband i was sorry and i loved him but goodbye he came to me and took me out eat and then took me to the hospital where i was voluntarily admitted and stayed for 18 days then did a partial program post discharge for 2 weeks at this time my parents had decided to get permanent guardianship of my oldest and my youngest had been with inlaws husband was too distraught to be a parent watching the woman he loved completely change and self sabotage i got on the right meds therapy 2 times a week marriage counseling and coping with the destructive effects of my actions took parenting classes went back to school full time back to work full time doing everything i could to support my new found bipolar 1 life and not relapse i get it i was not stable my parents took guardianship that was my consequence for a year went to court dealt with a guardian at litem tearing apart my every action every move my mother was making copious logs of every single thing me and my husband did said good or bad and all was seen as bad in their eyes finally got a court date and things went well the judge even said she was proud of me my father and judge said they both want to terminate guardianship but as a technicality were going to keep in place to keep child in same school for remainder of year advised me to file for termination and that the judge did not think i would have a problem lately i have been told by family things my mother has said such as she has raised my oldest child that i was not ever what she thought i should be things that she was saying behind my back for years to my in laws and my siblings just soul crushing words that make me feel completely inadequate the worst one is that she doesnt think the guardianship will be terminated because i wont be able to provide him insurance that isnt medicaid untrue and that she is his parent she does and says very hurtful things that discount my role as a mother she purposely leaves me out of his school info and dr appointments even though i voice and am available to be an active part of this i can give specific examples but thats not the point what is is that i feel as though my mother does not love me that she looks down on me for my diagnoses that she doesnt see how it hurts the youngest child and confuses both children eldest wants this over wants to be with mom and dad spends 90 of week with me how can i prove to my mom i am worthy how can i ever be enough she is obsessed with the idea that my oldest is her child and she has been saying it for a long time i am just broken and feel as though i no longer have parents just people im in a custody battle with,post-pandemic

i would like to share with you what i am currently feeling yes you who are afraid to go grocery shopping to go out with a girl or a boy or simply to walk down the street i have had this problem since i was 14 social anxiety with avoidance strategies last year at the age of 33 following harassment at work i decided enough was enough i went to see a psychiatrist and luckily i found someone right away who took my illness seriously after several sessions she prescribed me escitalopram 10mg and wrote a letter so that i could be hospitalized during the day in a clinic after several months of contemplation i took the plunge i took the antidepressants and faced the stares of others at the clinic the beginning was very difficult and the alprazolam that had been prescribed to me as a supplement was very useful in climbing the first steps today after 6 months of therapy i feel like im normal just like everyone else i want to go back to work im starting to flirt with girls ive had several dates ive joined a board game club ive started exercising again i look people in the eyes i can talk to people comfortably without being afraid of not knowing what to say this fear of judgment from others has almost completely disappeared 5 of what it was in fact i always thought that this social anxiety was a part of me when in reality it is not at all it is indeed an illness and the good news is that it is one of the few brain illnesses that can be cured i wish you all success to find the courage to take the step if you feel the need because yes healing is within reach if you give yourself the means if i did it then you can do it too,post-pandemic

my best friend killed himself at the end of september and i still cant handle it im 28f and he was 30m he was the most amazing person i had ever known and he told me once last june about his plans to commit suicide i tried to support him but he killed himself months afterwards i know that as i was at the time i couldnt be the reason he would want to live but it hurts so much that he left me he was the only one who would or could help i called him crying very late one night when he had a test the next day at 8 am and he came over and spent the night with me and then took his test on two hours of sleep and aced it because he was a genius how am i ever going to find a guy like him again i loved him but i never told him and he died all alone feeling like he was unloved ive cried every night since he died wishing i could join him in death i cant feel anything for anyone else he made me feel beautiful and loved and cared for in a way i never thought was possible now hes goneforever im such a failure i failed him i never made him feel like he made me feel he used to put his hand on my cheek and tell me that i was the most beautiful and perfect girl in the world to him now i pretend my pillow is his hand as i cry myself to sleep i failed him i was insecure and had intimacy issues and i never told him how he was the most beautiful man in the world he was everything he had led such a hard and tragic life but still he found the strength in himself to take care of everyone he cared for including me when i told him my father had sexually abused me i expected him to run for the door instead he held me and told me that he accepted me and loved me no matter what and that i was still beautiful to him im sobbing remembering the unconditional love he gave me i cant exist without him i reach my arms out into the air sometimes when im trying to fall asleep hoping i can feel his arms around me again why didnt i tell him that i loved him why did i assume i would see him again i feel so guilty i just want to feel his love again and to smell him as he hugs me he gave the best hugs in the world i just want to die and be with him again i want to tell him that i love him shanei love you im so sorry you died alone and that i wasnt there im sorry you died feeling like no one loved you because i do if only i had shown you what was in my heart maybe you would have stayed im sorry i love you with all of my heart i know you wanted me to live but i cant without you you were the only one for me but i was too stupid to let you in ill see you soon my love which is the first time ive called you that cassie,pre-pandemic

edit to the guys with bpd please dont read this as invalidating your experience this is just a ventrant from a female perspective i fully understand that both men and women suffer equally and in unique ways love to all everyone loves a borderline girl exciting adventurous dramatic sexual until she goes crazy then shes not so hot anymore then she becomes baggage a problem they wish would just go away and for that borderline girl when shes left alone and abandoned shes feeling like its all her fault another person has seen her for who she is although strong beautiful and exciting shes a mess and for some its too much of a risk to take we just want to be loved for who we truly are the good and the bad like everyone else,pre-pandemic
trigger warning trauma dump and suicidal thoughts feel free to skip this post if you dont want to read this rant about my reflection on my life sorry to the reddits mods i dont know where to post this im sorry if its in the wrong sub from birth until now my life has been nothing but shit my parents like to tell me that i was born this way and i believe it i was inherited their mental issues substance abuse disorder and personality disorders thanks mom and dad my family members were my first abusers sexually mentally and emotionally then they want to preach blood is thicker than water while all my relationships with them are shallow and conditional yeah okay i believed sexlove because my moms ex bf after divorce and moms brother molested me even my own younger brother and cousin would sexually abuse me occasionally by taunting me to flaunt my big breasts when we were away from our parents when i brought up the sexual abuse my dad didnt even seem to care to try to fight for more custody because he was so damn selfish didnt want to be a real parent and only cared about finding the next squeeze to cling on to then my teenage years came along and i was just a worthless annoying whore to them i was fucking every boyfriend i had after 14 years old my mom was so distracted with her new toxic boyfriend and building her nursing career that i was yelled at a lot and walking on eggshells if i tried to approach her for attention she didnt even seem to care either when i first brought up the sexual abuse from her brother we didnt make any attempts to move out of that living situation anytime soon i think we stayed for another year i remember the conversation like it was yesterday i was called a liar and family destroyer by my narcissist grandma how awkward it was to be working at her stupid business with her and my uncle throughout high school for cheap labor and money in my pocket while i had to act completely normal like no real trauma ever happened in our shitty family then i started dabbling in drugs at 13 alcohol sharpies weed cocaine ecstacy meth molly benzos and bars along with sex these drugs were filling all my empty voids at least it numbed my bad thoughts and feelings temporarily by the end of high school i lost the love of my life and one only friend hit my bottom there and moved states away i have been to rehab twice and jail once i still feel like i havent hit my complete bottom yet the longest ive been sober was 25 years i feel like the only reasons i was able to accomplish this was by being pregnant for 9 months and taking care of my baby i actually relapsed the day after my babys 2nd birthday because i just cant handle taking care of a toddler it started getting hard to handle at 15 i tried to stay strong for as long as i could this last year has been hard too i stayed sober for about 6 months then got high a couple of times in two weeks and then got a cps case by admitting this to my therapist by the way she was such a rude helpless bitch from the start as soon as i mentioned my past with meth and present alcohol use she called cps on me because i told her i was having a few shots of tequila in the evenings when my child was asleep and the one time meth use she would look bored answer texts and talk to other people in the office during our sessions talk over me and interrupt me while i was talking i guess i would do it too but it wasnt intentional and i feel shame anytime i do this to anyone she would shift blame outwards by saying it was a telehealth video appointment and since i wasnt looking directly into her eyes and soul i have such bad social anxiety that eye contact is hard for me to do we would often cut each other off i just think she was racist not suitable to be a good therapist and lacked empathy for drug addicts altogether my husband likes to blame my relapses last year on why our relationship is failing but the truth is it was always failing i mean we both jumped right into a relationship coming out of bad cheating ones then you want to know what it took for him to finally stop accuse me of cheating me having our child a day after i gave birth and the first day we were home after the hospital he even was asking me if the child was his what the fuck after being harassed degraded and traumatized for 3 years by him thinking i was cheating when i was working or going to school it all magically goes away when i become a fat ugly low self esteem recovering junkie i had to go through hell trying to have a normal life with him and now that im completely trapped i get treated good according to everyone in my life i dont know what real love is i feel like im never going to amount to anything meaningful or worthwhile in my life maybe this next time i relapse my heart will give out and i will pass on to another life and if there is no next life oh well at least my existence can be erased from everyones lives theyre better off without me anyway fuck valentines day,post-pandemic
im such a lonely person that tends to over talk when i get too comfortable and because i want to be liked and viewed as sociable today i got too comfortable and tried too hard to be funny and someone told me to calm down i feel so embarrassed and i couldnt stop thinking about it i should be asleep now and im still thinking about it i absolutely hate this about myself i hate it i feel like it makes me undeserving of love and friendship how could anyone find me attractive if this is the way i behave how would any friends enjoy my company i feel a bit better sharing this with people that may understand sometimes i prefer when im quiet i prefer it to when i try because it just leaves me feeling embarrassed,post-pandemic

after two weeks its safe to say my health anxiety has dropped from a constant 810 down to a 01 it is simply amazing that i am fortunate enough to feel like a real person again the key erp therapy ive been seeing a therapist who specializes in ocd instead of general anxiety it has made all of the difference even though i feel normal again i am going to continue with the therapy for as long as she recommends so that i know how to manage it when and if it returns which it probably will in addition i have stopped googling symptoms altogether for the last 9 days which also has included visiting this subreddit and have been making an effort to get out socialize and do things to get my brain away from the ruminating thoughts please do yourself a favor and find a therapist that specializes in erp,pre-pandemic

i feel like it makes a huge difference for me whether you are talking to me in person or through text you can say just about the same thing but the wrong phrasing versus the right phrasing makes a world of difference im honestly not sure if it is a bpd thing but i feel like it would make sense for it to be a bad tone just comes off to me as incredibly rude and inconsiderate whereas a thoughtful more sensitive tone conveying the same exact information comes off as 10x nicer it would be like if someone said you need to be able to handle this workload if you are going to make it through grad school versus i think this introductory class is a great opportunity for you to grow more accustomed to the standard workload involved with being a graduate student it says the same information but the second version sounds much more positive and encouraging rather than feeling like im being attacked the first tone makes me feel super dysfunctional and horrible about myself another example i can tolerate our lack of a sex life for now i guess versus i understand that you are working through trauma in therapy right now and am willing to put sex on hold for now since i know that ultimately your goal is to fix the problem big difference but it conveys the same information one feels like a slap in the face and the other feels encouraging and understanding edit the wording wouldnt have to be that extreme but the same phrase with a different tone can feel that drastic in person the wording or context is more relevant in writing sometimes it is literally the same sentence with the wrong tone or poorly timed sighs,pre-pandemic
i tried to get to know this girl but i think she thinks im a complete weirdo i know a lot of people already think i am one but i dont want her to see me as weird too i dont think she was ever interested anyway she seems to never want to talk to me weve only ever had one engaging conversation then never spoke again i tried to speak to her multiple times but i felt like she didnt want to talk i think its because of my lack of social skills that i pulled off a bad impression i liked her for a bit before realizing i had no chance then gave up i dont want to date people online anymore i want to meet someone in person but its so hard because i never know what to say or do i try to be myself but people are stirred away from that im not even a quiet or shy person but whenever i was with her i couldnt seem to say anything i was nervous of making the wrong move and now i wont be able to make any moves,post-pandemic
i told my parents that i see myself as disabled and they both said things like thats not true i cant call myself that and you are not disabled you just have a function variation while looking sad and upset i dont get what is so bad or sad about the word also i dont understand the argument for function variation the world i live in is not suited for my needs would that not automatically make it disabling as someone that was diagnosed late in life and many of my struggles dont show on the outside i find the word comforting a reminder that my feelings and experiences are valid im not making things up im just disabled,post-pandemic

i dont know if this is a me thing or an autism thing but i really dont understand why people talk behind the back of their friends or in general talk bad when someone is not there or insult something about that person that has nothing to do with the reason of their dislike es not liking their behavior but insulting their appearance like if you have problems with something i do say it to me i tell them to say it to me they dont one of my friends told me she and her best friend have code names for everyone and talk bad about us i dont get it i know i hurt her because of a relationship problem and she still has to get over it but she had codenames to talk bad about us even before everything happened between us in general people dislike others when theyre not there and nitpick every single thing they can find constantly if i dislike what someone does ill talk about it with people who agree and i wont stop even if they come around but specifically about the behavior that they did wrong im not very confrontational myself because i like to blend in and no one has wronged me personally i never had part in a big drama but i stand that they should know what part of their behaviour is wrong especially if they dont realise it themself just yeah i think it sucks and i dont get why people are always and constantly mean maybe its kinda naive of me to expect people not to suck but i really dont get what they gain from this shared hatred about someone thinking you are in the right thinking that person should die hating someone for as little as being annoying personally ive only hated one person in my life and thats because she kept robbing my friedships for 8 whole years i simply dont get the need to be mean and complain but not even try to approach the person is it like a therapist situation where people just have to get it out forgive me if my english was kinda odd or broken,post-pandemic

i am a 23m living in dominican republic i met this girl in september 2022 and it was my best relationship in a long time after being single and not doing anything with anyone for 3 years she was just the best girl i knew and she just broke up with me because she had a lot of personal problems and i was in my lowest point with work college and family life so i tried to unalive myself but my mother found out and took me to an emergency center where i was refer to a psychologist and psychiatrist where i was diagnosed with bpd and started taking medication the thing is that a week after she broke up with me a friend of hers told me that she thought i was cute and we started to fuck but it didnt last long because she seemed like a horrible person and i started dating girls from work the thing is that the first girl after my ex told everyone at work everything and it was known that i went out with her and my ex found out which led to an argument because she felt that i had betrayed her after she was the one who left me the thing is that she left the job and 8 months passed and i am not longer in medication and she saw me with a new girl that i was meeting from work and then she started to talking to me again by whatsapp and we ended up going back in october 2023 until now february 2024 where i am since these 4 months we are in a relationship and it does not feel the same at all i feel that i do not love her or anyone i got over the obesity i had for her and i just continue with her because she is a good girl and will have a great future she told me last night that she does feel like i dont love her and i say it just to say it but i just don feel anything even to my mom and think that she has been a great mom so i dont know what to do,post-pandemic

title edit face lol for as long as ive remembered ive been terrible with faces and names i latch heavily onto specific features of a person and use context to recognize people so as soon as they change said feature or i run into them outside of the specific context im used to seeing them i just pull a blank and tend to just not recognize them this has obvious negative social consequences its been brought up to me multiple times that this is a consequence of my neurospicy brain and i guess that makes sense to be fair when im with people whom i actually care about its easier but its still quite bad even when i mentally try and force myself to remember someone im still given coin toss odds of actually being able to recall a name andor face i struggle to recognize neighbors long time friends and more and if anyone here deals anything similar and has found methods or tricks to better cope with it,post-pandemic

hello everyone i would like to hear your experiences with studyingliving abroad while facing financial hardship during that time and how it effected your mental health especially anxiety do you wanna share your story how was your experience how are you feeling nowadays do you observe hyperindependency patterns in you or you might as well just use this post to pour your heart out here is my little story with anxiety i left my homeland and whole family and friends right after finishing high school during first covid year and moved to germany to study at the beginning everything felt right it was something i wanted all along i was able to find myself in friend groups university was somewhat manageable slowly this phase has started to fade away i started to experience financial problems as my family wasnt able to support me and after starting working while studying things have became worse spending 40 hours per week for university up to 60 hours if i have a lab was a necessity next to working 20 hours took my self time and social time away my grades are just barely enough to pass the exams and a few times just wasnt enough also the languagesocial problems i experienced in the daily life made me feel like an alien and as all my friends are students their schedule and interests have slowly started to change and my anxiety has peaked due to loneliness shortly after taking birth control pills i developed panic attack disorder and seeking mental help here was also very hard as the language is an issue and it is very hard to find a place and i felt so hopeless with my anxiety and i sometimes cannot stop thinking how my life would be otherwise if i were to choose stay in my own country where i could have my support structure and less of financial issues now i feel different i am coming to an end with my bachelor studies things have became more stable and i got used to my tempo having a healthy relationship where the mental well being is prioritised has been a very big part of this too i recently have been taking online professional help from a clinical psychologist from my country and i am hopeful about our work on anxiety and further issues as i get some clarity about my past anxiety situation while i am working on my present time i realise how foggy my thoughts were so foggy that it kept my abilities to learn basic stuff away it makes me just sad crying almost everyday and functioning by the commands of my anxiety is slowly fading away and i am happy to see my growth,post-pandemic

i havent had a health anxiety episode in a while but i think im starting to feel the beginning of one i can tell my mind is trying to find something to latch on eg my fianc has an acne spot on his back and i felt this dread creep in like a mist logically i know its just acne but i started contemplating worst case scenario i managed to forget about it but earlier i was washing my hair in preparation for a hair mask and noticed my hair to be very thin instantly i started inspecting my head and i contemplated counting all the hair that came out of my brush after my shower which is a little insane of me so im not concerned about a specific condition its more generalized but i can tell its just the calm before the storm is there a way to avoid it or is this inevitable i know why im anxious tomorrow i have orientation on campus to start the masters program at a prestigious university even though ive gotten both my undergraduate degrees from this same university for some reason i dont feel like im smart enough to be there the program is notoriously difficult to get into but im convinced i just got in by luck what do you do when you feel an episode coming on,post-pandemic

i think im more writing this for my own sake but figured it might help someone maybe hopefully take them all or take just one 1 the number one golden rule of ha yall already know whats coming never ever ever ever ever ever ever google anything resist the temptation and the urge no matter what do not give it if you must pick up your phone google something else like how to use reddit lol im new 2 stop looking for assurance in friends its okay to talk about it if they ask you how youre doing but stop seeking that validation that youre not dying thats almost as bad as dr google himself 3 unless you cannot breathe are bleeding are in excruciating pain or something else incredibly severe do not go to the emergency room if you have a symptom and its scaring you monitor it a bit a little bit see 4 and see if it gets better or worse especially when youre doing something does the symptom go away when youre busy and distracted anxiety if the pain gets worse but you can still walk and talk book a doctors appointment chances are itll have gone away by then and if not you have something to talk about p 4 stop checking your symptoms at every moment its a hard goal but do it in steps youre only going to check 5 times today tomorrow 4 the next day 3 remind yourself okay ive checked once today ive got two more times it gets easier 5 breathe 6 love yourself give yourself words of affirmation tell yourself you are bigger than this look at the birds and how they fly about no one takes care of them no one feeds them they dont get medical check ups and they are just flying around doing their thing 7 dont stop your life i know sometimes the anxiety andor depression can weigh you down so much that you physically cannot conceive even getting out of bed but just try every step is a victory 8 pray meditate 9 get counselling if money is an issue look for resources your mental health is just as important as your physical health it is worth it 10 dont be too hard on yourself if you break one of these rules one day at a time its such a struggle and its going to be hard especially in those daysmoments where you cant breathe where youve googled a new fatal disease and youre planning your funeral and picturing your loved ones lives without you when youve turned to your friends and family asking them about your symptoms when youre feeling that old familiar rise of fear creeping into your body and you feel your throat getting smaller at the thought of the fact that youve got something awful wrong with you when you go to the doctors and you feel like no one is listening and every one of them is telling you that you are fine that its just stress but you know your body you know what you feel how could it be stress you dont even feel that stressed keep going you are okay,pre-pandemic

im not sure if this is allowed here but i really need the advice my husband 24m unfortunately has a severe addiction to alcahol me 21 f has tried everything i can think of to help him like reducing how much he drinks therapy or just even just visiting the doctors to see how they can help he always says no for a little background info about him he went through alot of family trauma controlling parents causing minor ptsd such events being physically abusive he suffers with bipolar disorder and anger issues addictiondependency runs in the family i myself unfortunately suffer from bpd so situations like this are really hard for me my birth mother was also an alcaholic but my father left her and took me and my sister with him so i never really delt with it trying to talk to my dad about these past situations with my mother he tends to shut them down i try to talk to him about how im concerned about how much he drinks and say for example he drinks a litre bottle of vodka and he will start drinking from 10pm at night till 7 in the morning and then go to work and do the same thing when he comes home i suggest if there is there any way we can reduce it to maybe the 750ml bottle and then the smaller one and cut back and back till its ok but he says they dont give him the same feelings he knows hes an alcaholic and doesnt want to do anything about it using the facts that he has to deal with his past and his job and he just wants to feel numb and all the pain to go away he shuts me off and it ends up in him getting angry saying horrible things to me and then it leads to an angry argument i just really dont know what i can do to help i love the man so much and i dont want to loose him over it so if you can give me any advice on how to help him or even suggest things i can do that would be amazing ps sorry if i ramble too much im not used to posting my thoughts and feelings on reddit,post-pandemic

hey everyone checking in again five years after i made this post detailing my experience with health anxiety as i think i mentioned there i dont really use reddit so i apologize for not responding to any of the amazingly supportive comments im doing excellent never relapsed totally moved on etc but thats not what this post is about note i will not be sharing a link to the app im about to talk about i have firmly explained why people with health anxiety should only discuss medical issues with a doctor not google not ai not even family members i completely stand by this and you need to recognize i am writing this as a person who does not have health anxiety anymore please do not ask for a link im a programmer by trade and naturally ive been working heavily with ai i recently made an application with ai that allows you to input your age biological sex location medical history and a list of symptoms you are experiencing and it will spit out the top 5 most likely explanations based on the totality of the information present and the relative likelihood based on the epidemiology in other words based on your agelocationmedical circumstances what is most likely most people including myself when i developed health anxiety think of medicine as a matching game where the disease that best matches their symptoms is the most likely explanation that is completely wrong and not how the world works which is something those of us with health anxiety have to learn the hard way we desperately want an explanation that fits everything into a nice clean box so when we google our symptoms and find a rare disease that exactly matches our symptoms we assume that must be the most likely scenario news flash in reality its much more likely that we are simply suffering from a combination of much more common benign conditions thats where things get interesting i had the idea yesterday to take the exact symptoms and demographic data from when i first developed health anxiety using my original post on here as a reference since i hardly remember the exact details and i plugged it in to the app imagine the shock on my face when the results showed overwhelmingly that my initial symptoms were best explained by anxietypanic disorder extremely likely none of the conditions i thought i had which caused my health anxiety in the first place even made the list at all which implies they were well below a 1 chance not only that but as i started adding more and more of the symptoms that developed as my health anxiety progressed such as my fainting incident in the shower eye issues etc the diagnosis essentially stayed the same and the ai correctly identified all of the completely benign conditions that explained exactly what happened now heres the craziest part i went through hell for the better part of a year multiple er visits overnight hospital stay and more tests than i can count never once did a medical professional mention the word anxiety or panic to me never once i figured out i had anxiety completely on my own and even after explaining to my neurologist that i thought i had figured it out after all this time he completely dismissed me now i am not implying that these medical professionals are not doing their jobs in fact they are doing their jobs perfectly they are running tests and ruling everything out but on the other hand i could have saved myself a lot of suffering if i had even known anxietypanic disorder could potentially explain my situation even to this day googling my initial set of symptoms brings up a host of potentially dangerous and extremely scary diseases that are bound to trigger anxiety whereas an ai that has been told specifically to utilize the relevant demographic data and weigh relative probabilities was quickly able to identify that anxiety was a much more likely explanation in my mind that is pretty damn cool once again dont bother asking for a link as i wont be providing it the moral of this story isnt that you should be using an app to double check if you have health anxiety it is that you need to get it through your head that your thoughts as a nonmedical professional are completely worthless you truly know nothing if you are experiencing what you perceive to be a health crisis get checked out first and then once you get checked out remind yourself that your perceptions are not reality and in this case ai just so happened to be the medium that proved that yet again,post-pandemic
when i sound fully competent and selfaware as i explain that i have borderline personality disorder it doesnt mean i do not have bpd i am not always in the middle of an episode when i explain how bad i can get during an episode i am not looking for sympathy and reassurance i am not putting myself down so that you will validate me i am trying to be honest about what is to come so that we can both be prepared we should probably set important boundaries before we start any sort of relationship i will not have trouble respecting boundaries if our relationship was built on them it is harder for me to respect boundaries established later in a relationship for that i am sorry if i go fully silent in the middle of an episode it is not because i am giving you the silent treatment i am dissociating and trying to prevent myself from escalating the situation and doing and saying something i will regret please give me some time to let my emotions return to normal and recognize i am not trying to punish you if i discuss suicide i am not doing it to make you feel guilty to me suicidal thoughts are such a significant part of my daily thought process that i genuinely forget that most people are alarmed by casual suicidal discussion if you let me know you are uncomfortable i will work hard to stop mentioning it around you i do not want to make you feel responsible for my thoughts and i will always remind you that it is not your fault my enthusiasm and passion are not fake just because a few people on the internet say that it is if we bond over something and i am excited my happiness is genuine we are sharing a real connection i am not just mirroring everything you do i have my own interests and hobbies that do not change just because some of my identity is in flux doesnt mean all of it is if i become interested in something you like that is because it is a normal part of forming bonds with others if i am having a breakdown that has nothing to do with you the best thing to do is to distract me from the negative emotions i just might not be able to ask for that in the moment because i am not thinking clearly which is why i need to change the emotions before doing anything else please do not make empty promises if you dont think you are capable of something do not tell me that you are i understand wanting to make me happy in that moment but i am absolutely crushed by empty promises cancelled plans etc i have to work hard to manage my expectations please do not promise me the world when you know you cant give it to me if you want to end the relationship please do so do not lie to me about how youre feeling and stay with me just because you dont want to hurt me do not cheat on me because youre afraid of dumping me that betrayal makes it worse i know it will be hard but if i am begging you not to break up with me block me refuse to engage it will hurt me so much that i will try to do anything to stop the pain but i ultimately recognize that it is bad for both of us if i do that and it is easier for me to say that now than in the middle of an episode my love for you is real i will not destroy your life i have empathy for you i care about you my brain is a little bit broken and i have to fight it sometimes its too broken and its too hard for you i understand if you need to leave just dont listen to people who tell you i do not have the capacity to love care and empathize i do,pre-pandemic

so if youre reading this and currently in the midst of an anxiety disorder let me start by saying i know how you feel ive had panic attacks where the adrenaline rushes just dont stop ive been nauseated and unable to eat or drink for days on end ive felt so short of breath it was like drowning above water had the jitters and the lump in my throat ive also had all of the uncomfortable mental symptoms ive dissociated for almost a full day multiple times ive had racing intrusive thoughts that lasted weeks and sometimes months at a time and ive felt like i was going crazy a lot but im here to tell you my struggle with my anxiety disorder is over after almost a year of conscious and concerted effort all of the worst symptoms of my anxiety are completely gone some of the more mild ones still appear from time to time ill get fatigued or dizzyfoggy maybe once every few weeks but this happens so infrequently and becomes less frequent with each occurrence that it doesnt really bug me i was also on medication an ssri since day one and a benzo for the first few months and am in the process of tapering off so i wanted to write a post about how to get over each stage of your anxiety mainly because i know i really would have appreciated this kind of guidance when i first sought help in late april of last year if you want a summary of things you can do regardless of what stage youre at scroll to the bottom and check the paragraph in bold i dont discuss responses to specific symptoms here just a general approach if youre looking for tactics for specific symptoms check out the list of books i left in the second section i think the first one does a particularly good job of addressing every symptom but you can try the third if you dont feel it makes enough of a difference before you read i want to mention something once so i dont have to later on recovery is going to be like a rollercoaster some days youll feel like you made incredible progress and others youll have difficulty even doing simple tasks its going to be a lot of two steps forward one step back sometimes itll even be two steps forward two steps back but even those times are okay because they serve as proof that you are capable of improving just know that once you start to give effort things will start gradually getting better so here it is my comprehensive guide to recovering from an anxiety disorder if youre at a constant 910 1010 anxiety and cant calm down at this stage youre either in the middle of panic attack which lasts up to 60 minutes or you have gad and are constantly anxious i was diagnosed with gad and pureo but ive had maaaaaany panic attacks so i know this advice will work for both 1 stop trying to fight your anxiety symptoms understand that the best thing you can do for your body right now is just let it run its course this is the basis of acceptance and commitment therapy act which is one of the types of therapy currently used to treat anxiety disorders to do this dont try to stop any symptoms you are experiencing this is infinitely easier said than done at first but with practice youll be able to pick this up fairly quickly when i was first having constant adrenaline rushes i kept trying to consciously stop them this was actually making things worse the more you try to fight your symptoms the more worried you become which in turn causes your system to release more of the stresscausing hormones causing your symptoms to become worse the best thing you can do at this point is wait it out and let your body tire itself out questions doubts and fear will come up when they do remind yourself that this is a totally normal process that your body is going through and try to rest in the anxiety it may be difficult but try to ease into the symptoms this was initially what helped my adrenaline rushes decrease in severity and frequency if this isnt working and you find your symptoms are still persisting and wont stop ask for more as the dare response discussed later puts it run towards your symptoms if youve ever read a book on act this step is likely in there when you ask your body to make your symptoms worse youll find it cant the symptoms of anxiety are driven by a subconscious worry and not something you can control keep running towards it until your symptoms gradually begin to ease then move on to step 2 in case youre interested the clinical term for this is arousal reappraisal its not discussed very often but i found it to be very helpful 2 do anything you possibly can to get your mind off of the anxiety in older forms of anxiety treatment this kind of thing was referred to as a distraction tactic but in the dare response barry mcdonagh calls it being engaged this basically means do whatever you can to focus your mind on something other than your anxiety regardless of what level of anxiety youre at this is incredibly important your anxiety is most easily fueled when you focus on it so do whatever you can to move your attention to something else again much easier said than done and your mind will fight you at every stage but its an integral part of recovery when i first started out i found short activities the most helpful like picking up my guitarcajon and playing a song or two or doing homework 3 give it time your system cant sustain anxiety levels this high for an extended period of time unless you consciously fuel it if you are properly easing into your symptoms and engaging yourself in other activities youll eventually calm down to the next phase of anxiety recovery 4 if recommended by your physician a benzo might help benzos are basically nervous system relaxants but theyre no magic pill when i took my first dose of valium i didnt feel a thing it took a few days of constant dosing to see any effect benzos are fine to use in the very beginning but i will issue a warning about them try to use them as sparingly as possible benzos are not meant to be used in the long term and if the first thing you do when feeling anxious is reach for your benzo youll have real difficulty recovering in the later stages but since at this point youre in a constant state of panic theyre a great way to ease you down to the next lowest stage of anxiety so you can start focusing on the long term 5 journal i dont recommend this as much beyond this stage as ive found it doesnt really help all that much but in the beginning stages of my experience with gad i found journaling to be an indispensable asset to really figure out what i was going through just write out whatever youre thinking or feeling its a great what to get out of your head for at least a little bit 6 get up and do something to release all your pent up adrenaline walk around the block take a stretch break at work you dont need to be doing a full workout at this point just something to help you use the jitters and adrenaline youre getting for something productive 7 this one may seem rather minor but it helped me a lot in the beginning fix your posture its much easier to feel short of breath when youre in a position that doesnt let you breath easily if youre lying down lay on your back if youre sitting sit up straight once youve thoroughly calmed down from this point this took me about three or four weeks you can move on to the next step constant 6 810 with occasional panic attacks if youre at this phase you are probably still experiencing physical manifestations of your anxiety like jitters nausea jelly legs shortness of breath and so on but youre not in constant freakout mode anymore you can make logical decisions aimed more at long term recovery because rather than being focused on your anxiety 100 of the time you pay attention to it 80 90 of the time you may be leaving the house occasionally but your symptoms are still bad enough that they keep you at home most of the time so heres what to do at this stage 1 start reading or listening to books on what youre going through the more you understand the subtleties of whats going on in your brain and body the better youll be able fix them read up on therapy techniques as theyll be your quickest route to recovery in the end this ended up being the single most helpful thing for my recovery when youre knowledgeable of exactly what is at your disposal you can try everything and see what works best for you in fact i found really helpful ideas in books that none of my therapists had even heard of like your anxiety the list of books that will be the most helpful for you is very personalized but here are my recommendations all of these books are available on audible which is how i consumed them the dare response phenomenal book written by someone whos been through the worst parts of anxiety and paved his own path to recovery his techniques are a combination between act and a little cbt i would especially recommend this book if youre at the higher end of the anxiety scale feeling good the new mood therapy this book is considered the gold standard of cbt its aimed at treating depression but as the author notes it works for anxiety as well i listened to the whole thing then picked out the chapters i thought applied to me its long so i dont think you need to do the first part but theres a lot of valuable information in this book that a lot of other books skim over rewire your anxious brain this one is 14 cbt 14 lifestyle guidance and half about the neuroscience behind anxiety i like this one a lot because it gets into some of the mechanics of why we feel the way we do and why therapy and lifestyle changes are so impactful the subtle art of not giving a fuck this one has been mentioned on this subreddit several times before and i really like it it serves as a great reminder of why some things in life just arent worth giving a fuck about fair warning mark manson describes ocd as an incurable disease in this book hes not a doctor or therapist and isnt really knowledgeable on the subject so id take that section with a grain of salt but the message he drives home at the end is really good regardless remember the point of these books isnt to give you step by step instructions on how to get better rather they are there to give you ideas on how to best help yourself 2 get into therapy this is perhaps the second most important things you can do for yourself behind reading therapy is the first line of treatment for anxiety and for good reason once you find a therapist who you work well with youll notice you progress much more quickly some things to look out for when you screen your therapist are they nice kind of an obvious one but worth going over do you feel like they take what youre saying seriously are their answers usually thoughtful and caring are they experienced my first therapist was tremendously nice and caring but he didnt know much about anxiety treatment beyond the very basics like square breathing are they accessible or do you have to drive two hours to see them are they available for weekly sessions or can you only see them once a month it may take a while until you find a therapist whos right for you but this is a person youll be meeting with multiple times a month for several monthsyears i would advise giving your therapist at least three or four sessions before you consider switching to a new one 3 continue with all the acceptance techniques outlined in the previous section these are things that i remind myself of even now the more open you are towards your anxiety symptoms the more quickly theyll dissipate in addition if you can start easing off your benzo a little bit if youre taking it three times a day try to move down to two if youre down to two a day try one 4 start making some lifestyle changes that are proven to help with anxiety in the long term cardiovascular exercise its said that exercise is one of the most positive things to improve mood when youre anxious but id like to look at it from the opposite perspective when youre anxious your body is filled with excess adrenaline that keeps building up if you dont dump it out somehow the symptoms will inevitably get worse so getting up from your desk or your bed is one of the most effective things you can do to help yourself in the long term if youre not super exercise savvy my suggestion is to get out and walk jogging occasionally walking is great for releasing excess energy but you can boost the speed at which you let off adrenaline by running you dont need to do sprints whenever you run but youll get the most out of your exercise if you really challenge yourself each time more on this later meditation the reason so many people say this is so good for anxiety is because it helps you better come to terms with your symptoms it also lets you really hone in on some of the less productive thought processes youre having so you can learn to catch and correct them keep in mind the purpose of meditation is not to clear your mind and think of nothing in fact its almost the opposite while meditating your job is to let your body and brain work as normal and merely try to act as a conscious observer of all your thoughts and feelings a really popular visualization technique for this is thinking of your thoughts as clouds and youre just watching them pass by there is plenty of information out there on how to meditate and it includes helpful techniques like noting so i wont go into it that much here make sure that your approach to meditation is similar to your approach to exercise slowly ease into it by doing it for short periods at first then working up very gradually to longer periods after every couple sessions i suggest trying out the meditation app calm diet if youre reading this youve probably read the dos and donts of your diet about a hundred times but ill reiterate quickly here no caffeine no alcohol try your best to avoid excessive sweets and fried foods and those are shown 1 to worsen your mood in the long term one of the less known changes you can make to your diet is to include more natural sources of magnesium it is speculated 2 that magnesium plays a part in anxiety regulation though the research isnt entirely there yet regardless try to include dark leafy greens like spinach and whole grains like brown rice into your diet to hit this as a staple you can also take a magnesium supplement ill defer to the dare response for information about it though again research is shaky so this alone wont bring change medication this one will be completely at youyour doctors discretion some people respond well to antidepressants some dont i didnt feel like they helped me all that much but you might note the purpose of antidepressants isnt to make you happy or to gradually cure your anxiety research shows 3 that antidepressants are useful for supplementing long term change in the brain this is a really important thing to note because it means that antidepressants wont change anything on their own only if you give conscious effort will you be able to see positive change medication only makes it happen more quickly 5 give it time your nervous system doesnt change overnight it may need a week or two more before you achieve the results you want so just keep practicing your therapy techniques and doing everything you know works and push through once youve been at these things for a while youll notice your anxiety start to decrease to the next phase hovering around 4 6 if youre at this stage congratulations the first two stages are really hard to break out of and if you did it likely took a tremendous amount of effort so give yourself a pat on the back once youve reached this stage your anxiety likely doesnt manifest itself physically as much you may still get nauseated occasionally but most of the time youre able to eat and drink and hopefully sleep through the night youve started reclaiming your normal life you get out of the house relatively frequently and do things like run errands but youre still really anxious whenever you go out in addition though your physical symptoms may have eased up your mental symptoms may still be incredibly difficult to deal with so heres what you should do at this stage 1 keep staying the course its easy to flounder or stop and its okay if you do but remember to pick up right where you left off also dont beat yourself up for making mistakes everyone falters from time to time its part of what makes us human and its okay if things are taking longer than you expected take it from me that if you keep looking for ways you can improve your anxiety and practicing the techniques you know work things will get better 2 keep pushing the envelope identify areas of your life that youve always been anxious about and challenge yourself to use therapy techniques to improve them i used to beat myself up for being awkward ever since i was a little kid id find flaws in every interaction i had with others and nitpick every little thing once i started working on this i noticed not only an improvement in these kinds of situations but also an improvement in my overall anxiety this is part of how exposure and response prevention erp therapy works you expose yourself to situations that make your anxiety flare up and use cbt techniques to curb your conscious worry an important note about this is these experiences arent meant to be fun if youve got social anxiety and youre challenging yourself by going to meet new people itll likely be an uncomfortable experience the first few times people around you may be having plenty of fun while you keep worrying and criticizing yourself but youll slowly notice improvement and with time itll become more and more natural over time 3 along the same lines start making your workouts more difficult runbikeswim for longer lift heavier weights when youre anxious you tend to stagnate in certain areas of your life sometimes without realizing it the only way to get better is to keep pushing the bounds of what you do i saw a post on this subreddit a while ago along the lines of ive been lightly jogging for 25 minutes a day for the last month or two why arent i seeing my anxiety improve and the answer in this case is because this person wasnt pushing himherself if you continue to do the same things you shouldnt expect to see improvement 4 start identifying and cutting off some of your crutchesunhealthy habits for a lot of us me included this comes in the form of googling symptoms or constantly asking for help on this subreddit its okay to cave every once in a while at this stage but you need to consciously stop yourself from constantly asking for help on the internet one of the things this does is keep you focused on your anxiety which is exactly what engaging yourself is meant to prevent i stopped browsing this subreddit for almost a half year and my condition got much better as a result if youre seriously concerned about something visit your doctorpsychiatristtherapist and ask them but once they diagnose you do not second guess it i spent my entire college career going to different doctors i think at least 10 or 11 different types sometimes multiple doctors of each kind i was convinced there was something wrong with me that no one could find but the true culprit was anxiety if you feel like youre constantly sick or dying yet doctors cant find anything wrong this is a clue that you have an issue with being a hypochondriac you can go about fixing this the way you did in all areas of your therapy i personally used the cbt method outlined in feeling good but the important thing is to recognize that just because your brain is telling you something doesnt mean its true 5 give it time ive said it before but its important to reiterate recovering from this stage might take several months so try your best to be patient and remember if things arent the way you want them to be now they will be soon i think its also important to discuss the idea of cognitive fusion which you may have come across in your book reading as i think understanding it will be really helpful google defines cognitive fusion as attaching a thought to an experience but since thats kind of vague ill give my own definition cognitive fusion is when you take what your thoughts tell you as fact in other words youre using your thoughts to draw irrational conclusions about the world around you one example of this is if youre someone who criticizes themselves too much you might tell yourself that conversation was so awkward so that person must think im a loser in this case whether or not the situation was awkward you dont know what the other person is thinking i used to think this a lot until i realized people really didnt see me that way and all the worrying i did was for nothing a healthy level of questioning can do lots to help you overcome your anxiety at this stage i had the most trouble with mental symptoms namely the feeling of going crazy i thought the little floaters in my eyes were hallucinations i always second guessed my own sanity i thought the weird dreams or intrusive thoughts i was having were a sign of schizophrenia and anytime i was happy i thought it was a sign of bipolar disorder this is another great example of cognitive fusion that took me a while to get over i thought i was going crazy so to me that was evidence that i really was if you think this describes you it might do you well to get into the habit of questioning your thoughts as well is it more logical that your psychiatrist therapists family and friends are correct when they say youre not crazy and are just experiencing symptoms of anxiety or that youre the one person out of the fifty whos somehow figured out youre losing it this applies to basically every anxious situation you may encounter remember just because you think something doesnt make it true one of the things that took me a long time to realize was that my constant worry over these things was caused by the fact that i was paying so much attention to them at this point in recovery its absolutely imperative that you keep yourself occupied especially when youre most anxious i found that doing things like cooking and cleaning were ways to keep my mind off my anxiety without having to think about it i suggest doing the same as theyre both productive and beneficial in the end eventually your mind will calm down on its own and youll find your own solutions to these symptoms i find that at this point the really important thing really is time once i felt like i was going crazy for the hundredth time i realized that if every time before this one was a false alarm this one and all the ones after for that matter are false alarms too this stage took about 3 months to recover from but once i did i hit the next stage anxiety is 1 3 most days with some days feeling almost completely anxiety free youre in the home stretch this is it youre likely already giving yourself credit for all the hard work youve done but you should still take a moment to recognize just how far youve come for me having a day where i go out and try something new with friends while anxious is something i wouldnt have been able to do even before my anxiety disorder certainly not anything id ever dreamed of while in the thick of it seriously if youve hit this point the light should be at the end of the tunnel and on the days where its a little harder to deal with let me reassure you youre almost home free note your symptoms will still be present at this point some of the intrusive thoughts might still come sometimes youll have a bit of dissociation or an occasional almostpanic attack but you know how to deal with these things your moments of panic dont last more than a few seconds and your symptoms dont really illicit a response from you at this stage 1 you know what works best for you keep doing it you have your techniques and youve clearly demonstrated they work all thats left is to keep doing them and reap the rewards you know will come on the worse days when your anxiety peaks at a 3 or 4 remind yourself where you were several months ago and how youll never experience anxiety that bad ever again then gently engage yourself in something and ride the wave of anxiety until it subsides 2 slowly lose your crutches if you discuss your anxiety with your friends stop doing so as frequently and eventually stop altogether if youre still occasionally taking benzos slowly taper off the more of your independence you get back the more confident youll feel 3 keep exploring other areas of your life where youve had anxiety and use what youve learned to stop worrying for me this meant things like conquering my fear of heights by going snowboarding and confronting my discomfort with physical and emotional intimacy by going out of my way to discuss these things the more of these longstanding anxieties youre able to ease the better youll feel overall plus you get the added sense of achievement for doing things that past you wouldve never been able to do there really isnt much left to say at this stage i found myself being discouraged more frequently at this point just because i knew i was so close to the finish line but not quite there in case you need any encouragement remind yourself of how well youve done so far and that theres more to come then finally no anxiety with the worst days peaking at a 05 or 1 thats it all the voices in your head telling you youre not good enough have gone silent all those symptoms you used to worry so much about dont really happen anymore you might still be a bit fatigued or foggy some days but most of the time youre energetic present and can confront new challenges with a sense of confidence youve never had its been a few months since youve even given your anxiety a second thought you know some of your symptoms might come back for a short spell every once in a while but youre not worried about them you know exactly what to do when that happens and that theyll go away just as quickly as they came i dont have any advice for this point you know what got you here and have built up the mental fortitude to know youll keep on doing it congratulations you understand how amazing it is that you got to this point remember this feeling my therapist once gave me a great rule of thumb i think sums things up really well whatever your anxiety is telling you to do do the opposite if its telling you not to get out of bed do it if its telling you not to go to a social event do that if its telling you youre going to suffer from some grave illness remind yourself thats not true if its telling you to google your symptoms or ask for help dont if its telling you youre losing your mind remind yourself youre not give it enough time and eventually things will get better summary ease into your symptoms remember that its just anxiety and cant do anything other than make you uncomfortable youve been through this a hundred times before and survived every single time dont fight it when you fight your anxiety it only gets worse so let your anxiety do whatever it wants and just watch as a detached observer keep yourself occupied the more time you spend thinking about your anxiety googling your symptoms posting on this subreddit writing in your journal or just stewing in general the worse off youll be cook clean dance exercise paint draw do anything you can to forcibly rip your mind off your anxiety keep pushing the bounds of what youre doing expose yourself to more anxiety exercise harder try things youve never tried before make your anxiety flare up as much as possible because you know itll only benefit you in the end regularly question your thoughts just because you think something doesnt make it true youll find a hundred times out of a hundred the thing youve been dreading isnt half as horrible as your brain has made it out to be give it time youll find once you experience the same anxiety for the same reason for the thousandth time in a row that it becomes a bit easier to stop believing what it tells you thank you for reading this i really hope

when i was 1617m i had a drinking problem i would drink whenever i could get my hands on alcohol because it was the only way i knew how to escape i would do all kind of stupid shit when i was drunk try to fight people verbally abuse people for no reason throw up in peoples houses etc i would often get angry at my parents for no reason and once i even had a fight with my dad 2 yrs ago aged 17 i met up with 3 girls and a male friend i had had a lot to drink at this rate i was sitting in a bench with one of the girls and i put my arm around her she did not object to this so i thought i was on the next stage of flirting i asked ro kiss her she said no to that a minute later i asked again and a minute after that i asked once more all 3 times were rejected eventually i came to my senses and realise my attention was unwanted i feel as though if i was physically stepping the line someone would have intervened i cant actually remember any of this happening this is just what i got told i never forced myself on this person and i didnt get aggressive or violent when rejected after this happened she and all her friends left the venue and texted my friend that i fucked up and that no means no i probably freaked her out bad i didnt understand what i was doing and i thought i was flirting but i got it horribly wrong and upset someone when i heard about my actions the next morning i felt disgusted with myself i instantly apologised to the girl i did it to she told me she forgave me my friend told me that she was initially upset after it had happened that i pushed her boundaries but she accepted my apology that was the last time i spoke to all the people involved i feel disgusted within myself i feel like a predator who kept pushing someone i feel as though i might have traumatised her and ruined her life cos this was such a bad experience it was after that i stopped drinking alcohol as a whole because i was now aware of its destructive nature i havent done a thing of this nature since and realised that it was the alcohol dictating me after i apologised i didnt think too much of the incident but 18 months later for some reason its come back into my mind and its all i think about 247 i really cant understand why i did what i did i certainly wouldnt have done it sober but ive realised that its no excuse their friend said to my friend it wasnt that much of a big deal but i still cant forget about it i feel like a piece of shit for trying to do something without the other persons consent i was verbally asking for consent but i was being pushy about it since this has been of my mind i havent allowed myself to have anormal life ive since quit my job and i hardly leave my room i feel as though this is who im gonna be forever that drunk idiot that kept asking i told one of my friends bout it and he said it wasnt a big deal i cant even look my own mother in the eye knowing the way i treated a woman that night no charges were ever pressed or anything idk if i did something illegal or not but it was certainly immoral i hate myself for it every day and ive been thinking about ending my life over this once u do something like this in todays society there is no going back although im 2 years sober and wont do something like this again i just cant let the past go this haunts me 247 and honestly i dont think ill ever forgive myself for it i thought of myself as an ally of women but this situation says that i wasnt should i tell my mother what happened,post-pandemic
im worried about going off zyprexa 10mg but ive gained 30lbs and its affecting my cholesterol levels suppose to start on 5mg tonight and take that for a month then im starting lamictal 25mg for 2 weeks then 50mg for 2 weeks what can i expect from stopping zyprexa and starting lamictal has anyone else done this,post-pandemic
im on 50 mg of vyvanse and 10 mg 5 mg 2x of adderall daily stimulants have made me far less fatigued and im so happy for it yet every day im simultaneously awake like brain and body and tired brain it fucking sucks its suspected i have sleep apnea and im getting an in office sleep study in march but if i dont then im pretty much fucked sleep apnea would be a simple solution i get a cpap if i dont have apnea that means my next course of action is medication adjustments and seeing a sleep psychologist i already see a psychiatrist and two therapists im afraid that the medication adjustments will ruin me my motivation is still shit despite taking two stimulants its far better than before i started stimulants but everyday is still a struggle will i have to give up improved adhd symptoms so that i can get better sleep what if i give up those improved symptoms and my sleep is still shit then ill be suffering for nothing in theory if its a medication dosage problem there will be a magic combination that gives me better sleep which will make me less tired and possibly more motivated and still improves my adhd symptoms its so fucking frustrating i just want to be able to get good sleep and be able to function my sleep doctor is great though i went to him for a second opinion after my first doctor suggested going off my meds and losing weight my current doctor understands that going off my meds is absolutely not an option he was great at explaining things and answering my questions so i trust his judgement i just also dread this im so tired of being tired,post-pandemic

i dont know why i have felt like i am an actual idiot since i was a child i can remember as early as nine years old thinking why cant i get this right why am i so unaware of my surroundings why dont i understand basic concepts when i was a kid my dad used to call me an idiot all the time he used to tell me that my name should appear next to the word stupid in a dictionary thats never left me and is probably part of the reason why i feel this way cut to now and im in my 30s and it seems like everyone around me knows that im an idiot and never hesitates to let me know i dont do well at work im the slowest one at my job and i know the least amount about my field every job ive had in the past i had to quit because i couldnt handle the stress of feeling stupid i never excelled in anything further i still have no sense of my surroundings at all my stupidity and inability to understand the world makes me a little selfish and makes me do things without thinking about others ie being unintentionally inconsiderate in my relationship create issues at work that others have to step in on because i fucked up from lack of awareness etc and when i apologize for them people ask me how could you not see that that would hurt my feelings and i cant say this because it sounds like an excuse but i want so badly to scream that its because im so fucking stupid that i have no real sense of how people feel or what to do or how to behave most days im so insecure about this all i want to do is make myself a small as possible as to not anger anybody anymore my mom tells me all the time that i have no real sense of the world or i dont have the force as she puts it my boyfriend tells me i dont think very well and it seems like my very few friends would call me a little ditzy im so ashamed of this fact and i dont know how to fix it i read books i try to be as emotionally intelligent as i can but it clearly isnt working i feel like im resigned to a life of being vapid boring and just downright idiotic i hate myself im embarrassed of who i am i wish i was dead most days and this is the main reason,post-pandemic

my son was initially diagnosed with adhd at 13 years old and was prescribed adderal which he took for a few years and seemed to grow out of the hd part he is super bright but has done poorly in school barely graduated high school and went to 2 years of junior college propped up by athletics after his athletic endevours ended he was kind of lost and bounced between a couple of jobs before he landed a pretty good sales job he crushed it for a while and was making very good money but started to slip up a bit and had conflicts with his management and that job eventually fizzled out during that time he had a girlfriend and covid distrupted his business so i figured that had something to do with it but my gut feeling was that there was more to the story eventually he broke up with his girlfriend and hes been in a funk ever since would stay in his room for days get stoned all the time and only come upstairs and eat after we went to bed or we were gone at work its possible his girlfriend dumped him but he did tell me that she thought she was autistic and encouraged him to be tested so eventually we had a confrontation and i pretty much blew my stack and told him he needed to move out later that day he told his mom that he had participated in an autism study and was convinced he has autism he did not complete the study but heard enough to be convinced he is autistic he is super engaging and friendly and can strike up a conversation with anyone has no problem making friends but doesnt seem to be able to keep them he can be super kind and and friendly but can be rude and inconsiderate i also suspect he is now dealing with depression he has been living with a friend and his family and its not a very healthy environment for him he is obviously not eating well and he has lost alot of weight im really worried about him and want nothing more than to help him i have told him many times that hes not on his own that i will get him the help he needs and he keeps telling me that he needs to figure it out himself im afraid he just doesnt have the tools to do it on his own and is just going to stay stuck in a rut at this point i really dont know where to turn he doesnt have insurance which doesnt help but i dont mind paying for treatment he is dead set against medication so even if he agrees to treatment it will be a struggle to get him to agree to medication any advice on a course of treatment or similar stories with positive outcomes would be appreciated,post-pandemic

well i messed up again last night i was at a homeparty where i had a little bit of alcohol nowhere near drunk and took a couple of puffs from a joint it got even more fun when i started to have a panic attack and dissociate as the weed kicked in i had to run to the bathroom locked myself in as i went through my thing and tried to ground myself i was with trusted friends but i was too stressed and embarrassed to tell them what was going on eventually i came out of the bathroom and stayed for a couple of hours with constant grounding and reminding myself i am okay i got home and the symptoms worsened its much harder to distract myself when im alone dissociation settled in though mildly and also the panic i managed to sleep for 4 hours woke up at 8am panicking like shit feeling like i had to throw up ran to the corner store for some coca cola and snacks talked to my bf on the phone and went to sleep again i do feel much better however now that it is night in my country the feeling is kinda creeping up again i think at this point it has less to do with weed and more that im caught in a cycle i suffer from anxiety and go to therapy for it anxiety loves control of my mind so im overthinking my experience which is causing the panic originally from last night that hasnt settled down to increase then i feel even more panic then i panic because im panicking then i think omg this wont ever go away then i dissociate then as mentioned compared to a 1010 im caught between a 310 and a 610 so far to help in my recovery i would love to hear some experiences and advice to let me know it is okay and it will eventually fade,post-pandemic

i have social anxiety but i usually manage to keep it a secret im good at talking and able to get out my head sometimes to converse with others and people have usually described me as bubbly extroverted and confident it is a lie i have cold sweats tremors racing thoughts of everyone in the room hating me or thinking im weird i just use the fact that i have been blessed with the gift of the gab to put on an act i ended up testing 133 verbal iq while very nervous as i usually am as a child people would try and beg my mother to get me checked for not having appropiately developed language skills she would try to tell them that i was fine but alot of people never believed her i was reading at a college level by middle school so of course this wasnt true but when i would go to talk to people i would clam up as young as five i hid behind a chair when my grandma tried to arrange a playdate and i couldnt calm down enough to say hello without shaking and blushing profusely i really pushed myself in my teen years to be braver and thought that would help i spoke publically raised my hand 5 times a day in classes chatted people up even when i thought i would literally faint wore bright colors i also wanted to but felt like i never could makeup included while it sort of worked it has also backfired immensely it sounds gross but its like peeing you hold it and hold it until you cant when it falls through and inevitably i have what i call an episode i look as though ive suddenly begun to present with shyness due to whoever is in the room i have then had rumors spread about me being attracted to multiple guys that im not attracted to making it difficult for me to not be anxious around men an example is my tremors i was made fun of for a lot of things growing up by my abusive family i lack confidence in most things such as my gait but i have learned a fake it till you make it approach to almost everything i shake when i walk in front of people to the point where my legs will stop moving i suddenly feel as though all the attention is on me and attempt to shrink further into myself that would bring more attention to me so i developed a different strategy i would always tell myself to straighten out and calm down apparently it looks like im strutting and showing off and i have been labeled a whore i even had whore screamed at me from a window in university i was slut shamed by other girls guys spread rumours about me being attracted to them or their friends now i just dont go anywhere and i dropped out of school i was in a good mood and was able to talk confidently to a random guy i had just met i like to push my limits and a girl told me that i just had to go and flirt with the implication that im some super flirty flingy type i havent even kissed anyone honestly its hard to talk about some people make me so uncomfortable i just shut down my entire range of emotional expression as some sort of shield this paired with my social awkwardness hard to operate normally when youre trying to mask every single symptom has gotten me labeled as bipolar autistic psychopathic oppositional narcissiticlow iq cold and standoffish to name a few they see my sudden lack of emotion as a mood swing or an intimidation attempt or they think that the rest of the time im faking emotion to manipulate others and that i experience reduced emotional capacity or they think that i have difficulty expressing emotion and that the rest of the time im masking or that im just slowlow iq everyone thinks theyre a psychologist now i even had older family members who i have since cut off repeatedly try to convince me that i dont have emotions like normal people do and that i dont experience empathy i spent my summers as a teenager tutoring and reading books to children at libraries i would take my sisters to the park and planned outings for my even quieter friends to accompany me i have literally cried at sad movies and i dont even like hurting flies i have moments where i literally cant hurt a fly i cant bring myself to my crying was decided to be a trained manipulation tactic by some of these people because i usually dont show emotion no joke i know that i should talk to someone i should let the people around me know to prevent miscommunications i even clam up around my therapists but at least they understand but it seems like theyre out to get me so much opening up terrifies me what if they make fun of me which some have and when i do come forward people dont believe me how did my social anxiety turn into a reputation for being a whore stuckup attentionseeking dramatic flirty psychopathic mean fake a bitchetc yes these things were actually said and why does noone ever just ask me whats going on or how i actually feel i would tell them why play all these games with me instead i feel like trash and quite honestly like a freak that just cant fit in i really need advice and support from people that understand please,post-pandemic

about six years ago i was diagnosed with hodgkins lymphoma i battled it for several weeks before i was finally cured this was my first encounter with a terminal illness at the age of 15 i was healthy for a long time everything was great until i discovered i had a brain tumor i didnt have headaches often but this one could only have one explanation i knew i only had a few months left to live miraculously my tumor atrophied over the course of a week and completely disappeared i felt normal again things were great i was a new person until i contracted hiv i knew it the second it happened i wont go into details about the event that led to this but what else could explain the enlarged lymph nodes about a week later and then the fever and night sweats every symptom of a new hiv infection listed on wikipedia fit perfectly except for the ones that didnt this was the first major disease i had that lasted more than a month in fact it lasted over half a year i purchased my first hiv test kit 16 days after the initial infection i knew that the detection window was usually 46 weeks after the initial exposure but i religiously adhere to the mantra of better safe than sorry of course this test came back negative but i already expected that i was able to wait another 2 weeks at which time i immediately purchased a test kit twopack 58 for two tests was a better deal than 37 for one and hey i need to start buying in bulk if i want to test myself as often as my brain tells me i should test 2 came back negative but lets be honest only 75 of people infected will test positive 4 weeks after exposure i figure that since my immune system was naturally already so weak i get a cold maybe once every year or two i would probably take a bit longer to test positive i used the second test at 6 weeks which is around the 90 accuracy mark negative ive always been unique eight weeks and 4 tests in and it finally happened as i sat and waited the 20 minutes for the test results i broke into a cold sweat i already knew the answer and by the time i flipped over the test swab i had already accepted my fate negative fuck just be positive already so i can move on with my life alright alright not to worry im still only in the 96 accuracy window thats 4 people out of 100 that get a false negative 2 out of 50 1 out of 25 im way more unique than 1 out of 25 im like 1 in a billion 1 billion times 1 out of 25 is like 40000000 which means i must have hiv right i accepted my diagnosis even though the damned test kits kept lying to me i didnt really need their confirmation to live like a sick dying person heck i was really good at living like a sick dying person all on my own i had plenty of experience with it having already survived 2 terminal illnesses to this point i wallowed in self pity for another two months before the panic started to come back i was beginning to feel a bit sick sore throat runny nose uh oh i knew what that meant aids was setting in and i had just developed an opportunistic infection my immune system was probably already compromised even before i got hiv which is why the tests kept coming back negative i mean i dont have a scientific source for this but if you have no immune system in the first place then youre not going to develop any antibodies to hiv when you contract it and since the hiv test i had used detected the presence of antibodies and not the virus itself thats why the tests werent coming back positive as i lay on my deathbed i gave in and dropped another 60 on two more test kits bringing my total up to 6 i wasnt going to need the money when i was dead after all i took the first one 4 months after the initial infection and it came back negative not to my surprise this was more of an addiction than anything now i didnt really care about the result so much as the process 2 months later my aids had subsided a bit i took the second test for shits and giggles and it came back negative i felt like i had been trapped on a roller coaster for the past 6 months i had developed severe generalized anxiety alongside my hivaids infection to the point where i couldnt even drive to the grocery store without having an allout panic attack then things got better i told myself that i could beat this disease i just needed to take care of myself i started eating healthier forcing myself onto a better sleep schedule and even moderately exercising then something amazing happened my aids started to rapidly subside within a week i had regressed from terminal aids patient to a runofthemill hiv patient but i was able to cure myself of the hiv too all in all two weeks after i set my mind to it i had beaten this debilitating disease to a pulp i felt amazing for the first time in over a year i had a new life new possibilities new energy and drive i was going to conquer my dreams now no longer my illnesses and i did pretty damned good until i discovered that i had a congenital heart defect you know the story from there i sunk down down down then i saw a doctor had a battery of tests was told i was healthy as an ox and began to rebound here i am today 3 months after surviving the heart disease this week i learned i have ms i am not looking forward to this fight but i have confidence that i can beat this diseases ass too today i was diagnosed with another disorder as well its called health anxiety and this is the one im not going to fuck around with overall it is one of the most debilitating diseases imaginable it can turn a person with boundless potential into a sickly shell of their former selves

basically about a month ago i was eating a pot noodle and then it felt as if it was stuck in the bottom of my throat so i tried to have some water and for some reason it made the sensation worse me being me i suffer from anxiety had a panic attack and it felt like i couldnt breathe since then ive found it hard to eat anything and i sometimes struggle with liquids i had a choking episode on a drink about 5 years ago where now the way i swallow drinks just feels weird in general i had an endoscopy done about 2 weeks ago and they found nothing wrong and on the same day i managed to eat some chicken and a tuna sandwich but since then ive found it hard to initiate the swallow reflux and the whole process of swallowing doesnt feel right im currently on a waiting list to see a slp and waiting to be referred to a ent but im just getting annoyed because i want to eat but every time i go to eat i get really anxious and its like my brain has forgotten how to swallow i see people say that drinking while eating helps them but i find it makes it worse when i drink to try and move the food down my mum and doctor believes its all in my head and when i wake up i can manage to eat biscuitschocolate but the more the day goes on the harder the swallowing gets and the fear of choking increases just want to be able to eat again without fixating on the whole swallowing process,post-pandemic
i 22f want to stop i am scared for my health and i am scared to ask for help ive been drinking almost everyday since fall 2020 was binging for over a year now i drink after work about 2 or 3 pints of beer but when i go out with friends which is often its almost always upwards to 6 drinks i am in my hometown currently and i feel the urge to tell my parents my dad is an alcoholic and has been sober for over 10 years at his worst he was hospitalized and sent to rehab he was close to death though this happened when i was very young and was never really told about his condition i got blood work done recently and while most levels are in range liver enzymes are normal high i know my lifestyle is not sustainable but of course i have plans with an old friend to drink today my sister is getting married soon and i cant stop thinking of my parents paying for the cost of that plus rehab or treatment i dont think i need intensive inpatient but i feel my parents would push for that i know how lucky i am to have a family that would support me through it so why cant i come clean i feel like a burden i feel helpless i dont want this to continue,post-pandemic

just found this subreddit and tought i had to share how my health anxiety is almost completely gone and its been gone for a couple of years now my way of overcoming it isnt by any means a way i would recommend to anyone since it was extremely time consuming and ate thousands of hours of my life hours wich i couldve done something better with even tough it almost cured my health anxiety so just like every hypochondriac i tought i had new diseases all the time i cant even count how many diseases ive tought i had and as most others i always googled the symptoms and some horrible disease came up but my anxiety became worse and worse through the years and after a while basicly all i did for a period of 2 years was to read about diseases i was completely obsessed reading in my freetime and at work every opportunitie i got i started to read on all the normal websites in my first language english is my second language at first read everything i could get my hands on then i started reading these websites that had alot of words that only doctors and such would understand so i started googling all these words and phrases so i could understand what was being said on these websites and after a while once i didnt think my first language websites had all the information i wanted on whatever disease i had that week i started to read everything in english too i got so extremely knowledgeable on a ton of diseases that i started to understand every small detail and intricacies of alot of diseases then i started to understand that the first website that comes up when you google some symptom is just a short summary of an disease and yes you might have the same symptoms but if you get get very familiar with a disease you start to see that the symptoms you have are not at all the same as most people with this specific disease are experiencing at for example an early stage of a disease im not sure if im explaining it really well but i hope you get the gist of it but i think what eventually cured me from health anxiety was the same thing as exposure therapy even tough i did it unknowingly becouse i did spend thousands upon thousands of hours reading and looking at pictures about diseases in 2 different languages i do suffer from other forms of anxiety still but i would say that my health anxiety is atleast 8590 gone i feared so much for so long and i exposed myself so much that it no longer scares me if i get some symptom now i basicly think its nothing or im brave enough to accept whatever disease that might come and just move on with my day but like i said earlier i would not recommend my way of overcoming this to anyone there are probably tons of better advice and less time consuming out there but i wanted to share my story becouse it might help someone in some way,post-pandemic

ive been seeing a lot of posts here lately that really concern me not just as a moderator but as someone who has been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder in addition to bipolar and now that im getting pms and modmail about this exact issue i feel like we need to talk about it i do not think people with bpd or other personality disorders should be made to feel uncomfortable here and when someone posts here claiming their diagnosis is superduperrapidcycling bipolar and their medication isnt working i would not tell them they probably have bpd because what does that mean the saying i like to say about myself is that im the kind of crazy a pill cant fix anyway i saw a couple of people make comments saying that bpd is untreatable that even dbt doesnt do that much as a guy who has tried to employ dbt techniques himself too poor for an actual program i can say that not only has this helped me more than any form of cbt but its helped me tone down my bpd tendencies altogether given that i was destroying nearly every relationship i had i cant help but be grateful for that but the facts remain one bipolar disorder can manifest in many ways and none of us here are professionals capable of providing diagnostic advice two even within a community of people with mental illness the stigma of other less treatable disorders still remains i dont want that on here and im pretty sure the other mods dont either theres a ton more i want to say about this issue but i want to put this up first so i can get you all to chime in and see what direction this goes in im really looking forward to hearing what everyone has to say about this subject since its about time it needs to be addressed,pre-pandemic
im curious mainly because i finally got around to cleaning the closet this summer with the help of my mom i was shocked at just how much shit i had kept in there for whatever reason or another it even extends to my computer where i have software i think ill use but it instead sits there just wasting space after really wanting to make changes due to the improvements from me taking my meds im finding that its a lot easier to let things go now than they ever were in my life prior to all this how about you guys,pre-pandemic
double annoying because were always fine after a panic attack a panic attack is actually a sign that everything is fine and youre not in any danger but its still terrifying every time i hate panic attacks,pre-pandemic
i often fantasize about fainting in public and all the people who would rush to my aid i also imagine people eg my therapist a guy i just met one hour ago a former boss exbf etc seeing it happen and being concerned a few nights ago i had a dream about fainting on the side of the road and hoping while blacked out that someone would come over and try to help me when no one did i tried to prolong the fainting spell as long as possible and kept hoping i wouldnt become fully conscious again before someone had seen me and come over i think this fantasy is about wanting others to see my pain and care and about not wanting to be alone i often have it when i am in a situation i want to escape anyone else,pre-pandemic

the next semester at my college started a few weeks ago and ive been really wanting to join some clubs since i currently dont have friends in my college sadly the clubs ive joined have already had meetings and i ended up being too afraid to go to them for one of the clubs the tabletop gaming club i ended up sitting outside in the hallway too scared to walk in on the first meeting despite knowing there was gonna be other people there that were new i just had so many racing anxious thoughts like theyre gonna hate me because ive never played most of these games everyone will already know each other and youll just be awkwardly walking around alone etc the same thing happened with the music club i just procrastinated on going because i felt like people would judge me for carrying a guitar around i also was too scared because i felt like everyone would know each other again ive even tried bringing a small amount of vodka in a water bottle to try and get more confidence to force myself to go and it didnt even work now most of these clubs are on their third meeting already and now i know its going to be even harder to join since i didnt go to the first meeting and people will be thinking who the hell is this random new girl thats really awkward i feel like ive ruined the whole semester by being too scared to join initially because its going to be way harder now since everyone will already know each other at this point im almost certain im doomed to a life of being sad and alone and im so depressed ive even been comparing myself to former high school friends who have moved on to have amazing social lives in college and i feel like such a failure how can i force myself to join clubs when i have such bad social anxiety especially with it not being the first meeting anymore,post-pandemic

my dad called me the other day to tell me some news my molester brother was coming to christmas with his partner and my dad was wondering if i would be able to handle it without making a scene everyone will be there including sisters boyfriend it would mean a lot to mom to have all of her children under one roof he continued before grandpa died he said all i want is peace in the family and thats what i want my brother used violence to coerce me to commit sexual acts on him from the time i was 514 and he was 1120 when i told my school guidance councillor she was mandated to report it and an investigation was initiated on the morning of my first interview with the police my dad took me to breakfast at my favour restaurant in our small town where he said you can either put your brother in jail or you can keep the family together i lied to the police told them i didnt want to talk about it the investigation went away my parents never punished nick when the investigation was over they let him pick any city in the us and they would help him move there he picked nyc that was 11 years ago ive kept my silence to keep the family together my parents keep reminding me in our bitrimonthly family fights that there was nothing we could do and there will be no more family if you keep up with this my brother is always playing the saint and they just fawn over how success and accomplished he is hes seen as the darling helper who could do no wrong whenever i try to talk to my family about what he did they tell me tell your therapist that not us in my mom and is most recent fights she let out a tirade of why didnt you tell me it was happening why didnt you tell me one time and then followed that up with when i was a little girl i prayed to god that i would have kids but now after all of this i wish i never was a mom i have been trying to go nc with my brother but my family doesnt seem to respect that i often get texts from him in the family group text saying overly positive shit like nothings up hes coming to christmas and my parents wanted me to go on a trip with everyone else including him and his girlfriend where i would be expected to not make a scene i need some sort of grounding because ive been keeping quiet with this hell of family and rape for 21 years first so my brother wouldent get in trouble and secondly so my parents wouldent look bad to their family and friends the biggest hypocrisy of this is that i was sexually abused as a child by another perpetrator a older man who abused me for 2 years concurrently with the time i was being abused at home i told my mom what had happened he then was charged and convicted and sentenced to jail i had my parents full support then i told my parents about this man abusing me in particular first so they would know how to handle my brother turns out they didnt i am still glad i told them in that order because if i had told them about my brother and then the older man they would have covered up both and i likely would have killed myself from the stress that i otherwise barely survived edit thank you everyone for your support,pre-pandemic

this is in the uk btw basically ive been struggling to recover from an eating disorder at home for about 4 months now i left inpatient in november after being there for 12 weeks and not being able to make a lot of progress this was due to a lot of things but things going on in my life mindset as well as not receiving enough or the right support on the ward were a big partive been trying to recover at home but this is also not going great as i dont have a lot of support at home and the community support isnt gr8 either i think im nearing the point of being admitted to hospital again but im so scared theyre going to section me they mentioned it a while ago when i was leaving the ward but i dont know if theyd consider doing it now ive been very open to my lead professional and my dietitian about my struggles and weight and i would be willing to comply with what they said if they wanna admit me to hospital and suggest i should go inpatient again i just really really dont want to be sectioned does anyone have any advice on how to avoid this its so hard to find a balance between admitting u need more help and also showing you can be safe enough to not need to be sectioned,post-pandemic
before i start this story i just want to say that for the past 4 years i have been suffering from social anxiety depression and suicidal thoughts so the other night i went with my brother and snuck out the house to go smoke weed bc i thought it would make me feel less depressed however when it was my turn to hit the blunt i took like 5 crazy ass hits and my chest started to feel really fucking weird and hurt plus it was a little hard to breath but then when we pulled up to wendys to order food it felt like i was in 4d or some shit then i remember my heart beating fast as fuck and hard and i just started screaming help fucking help me and like i just started screaming whatever was in my mind and we had to drive away and we went to my sisters house and when i went in there i can vividly recall falling into like a counter and it was in slow motion i was like blinking very fast and every time i blinked i would be somewhere else i remember the ambulance coming and my mom and dad and i couldnt even open my eyes i was so mad and sad at myself for letting this happen i eventually went to the hospital and everything was in slow motion the entire time and my heart was beating hard and it hurt and after this entire experience its like my parents didnt even care they only cared about punishing me rather than how i felt and now all my feelings hurt more than ever bc now noone looks at me the same and i just dont know what to do,post-pandemic

its so incredibly frustrating to know youre acting on emotion rather than logic but being unable to stop it its like im a passenger in my own brain and im trying to tell the driver who is also me to fuckin chill but they cant hear me i thought i didnt experience dissociation but sometimes when ive been in severe crisis mode during an episode i feel like im watching myself rage from outside of my body it feels very surreal and my rational mind is like stop youre making it worse but my emotional mind aka bpd has full control of my words and actions and is like oh you think thats bad hold my beer ive just been thinking about this recently because i relapsed just when i was doing so well but we all know that recovery isnt linear blah blah but its still so humiliating to know that i made a huge scene over something trivial fun fact alcohol does not help this situation my roommate and boyfriend could obviously see that i selfharmed too so that was also super embarrassing im so lucky they havent written me off yet but im determined to go the rest of the year without absolutely losing my shit,pre-pandemic
ok so what somtimes really pisses me off is the masses of people claiming to be autistic without a diagnosis generally its teenagersyoung adults who often claim to have other mental disorders i know its difficult to get a diagnosis and its a long process but at least where i live its free under the nhs autism isnt something you can just claim to have its complex and needs the opinions of specialists who have undergone training a lot of people claiming to be autistic tend to disregard this obviously i think its fine to suspect that you have autism but it just really upsets me when people just say they have it its really devalidating firstly ive struggled for years due to my autism and still people say to me well its not real is it people claiming to be autistic is a major contributer to this idk if i sound bitter or ignorant but this is something that really upsets me thanks lol,pre-pandemic

every person therapists especially seem to think that i merely lack discipline or have difficulty doing hard work or maybe the things i want to do just arent a priority ive been trying or six years to combat depression through therapy exercise all these stupid habits but how can i do that when it takes immense energy just to respond to a text or google interview questions or if filing taxes makes me want to pull my hair out but to the point that i may be facing consequences over it its like they dont believe me if i say how much effort it took to google an interview question really it was a lot of effort just googling how long did it take 2 seconds and it was a lot of effort theres so much gaslighting happening its crazy to me ive been to therapist after therapist for executive dysfunction specifically task initiation and completion they all get irritated or confused and think i am lazy maybe they are right many people have grit discipline or just so much intelligence they can make it through life i simply cannot i dont have what it takes yes i have a weak mind i cannot see the forest for the trees anymore when every single thing is so fucking hard even things for fun are so hard i give up nobody wants to help me medication does not help me ive tried three stimulants and one ndri none helped with this only one helped like one time id be all for working hard if i had the will to do basic tasks i dont mind studying instead of watching tv learning a skill or going to a job fair instead of staying home hell i even used to like this stuff but it all takes so much mental effort and will each and every time i suppose i simply dont have the personality or whatever it seems to take to achieve anything in life,post-pandemic

i work at a bar and i also freelance for a media company nearby recently my sleep has been awful as do many people with adhd i struggle with maintaining a good sleep routine sometimes i dont feel tired until 600am even if i wake up early the day prior and have a busy day this week my sleep has been like the worst its ever been for my shift at the media company i had to be there at 500am so i just decided to not sleep at all after a week of these shifts id probably only slept in about 3 of those 5 days after one of the shifts i was scheduled to be at my pub the day later i went to bed early 9pm and was hoping to get some rest even though i hadnt slept since almost two days ago i still wasnt tired and it was now 700am i had to wake up at 1000am i basically just decided that i wasnt going to turn up and actually sleep it wasnt worth another sleepless night as it was becoming dangerously unhealthy at this point this was for thursday its now sunday and i feel really bad the shift was a wake and i feel like ive disrespected the family by not turning up the manager for letting her down and the staff for making their shift more difficult i havent even checked my phone since just before i fell asleep i told them in the group chat my knee was hurting and i really dont know what to do going forward i think i have a plan for sleep in the future but how do i deal with this recent event first,post-pandemic
i just wanted to share this sub has been real helpful and relatable and i just wanted to let you guys know that there is a lot you can achieve with adhd sometimes in spite of it and other times because of it clearly it all affects us differently and i think plenty of people in this sub have worse symptoms than me but i think there is a lot of upside to being a creative emotional and forgetful ball of energy i feel so happy life doesnt feel real i got a parking ticket today because all i can think about is where im going to law school thank you guys for being here and dont count yourselves out due to your diagnosis,pre-pandemic
our friends and family all assume my young sis has autism or some sort of disorder like asperger however im the only one in my family that thinks she is just an evil and cunning person that has ruined the entire family she is 30 ive read up on autism and she does exhibit only some of the symptons for example communications she is bilingual and can speak faster than i can her vocabs arent brilliant but it does get the job done saying that she doesnt have any friends incredibly manipulative ive even google to see if autistic people even knows how to blackmail people came up with no results and most of the time it says they have difficulty understanding jokes or sarcasm however my young sis understands them fully well we have had maids or caretakers in the past she blackmails them to buy her toys and things she wants or she threatens to get them fired by lying to our parents for beating her etc every time we take her to see an autism specialistdr she puts on an act she refuses to answer any question and if she does its always a one word answer like yes maybe and no most of the time she will say maybe just to confuse them she is very attached to my mother and not a minute of the day that she would leave her side she is also very abusive and violent if you confront her and tell her off or say things she doesnt like she will slap kick spit on you im the only one that she wont do it to because i will return simply return the favour she slapped my grandad who was 90 years old in a wheelchair simply because he told her stop being so naughty or when he takes up my moms time gets jealous of any one getting close to my mom including my dad needless to say they havent slept in the same room for the past 30 years now from what i believe she started off being just slightly weird but over the years its getting worse and worse i think she puts on an act at first but because she keeps repeating this all day she has grown into it and its becoming a normal thing for her she pretends so much that its becoming a reality and she is going crazy saying that she did get put into a mental hospital last year for beating up nurses and doctors my parents had to pull some strings and make up lies to get her out of it i can go on and on and on but from what i wrote it doesnt sound like she has autism right she does exhibits mental illness things like she will stare at space and will start laughing and try to talk to invisible objectsnot person she makes weird sounds daily like a baby she acts like a baby all the time makes really weird and strange faces from what i can see it is a way to get my moms attention and she thinks its cute to act that way up to around age 25 i think she she was just a cunning and evil person but the last 5 years has changed so much that i dont think she is putting up an act anymore she is going lunatic she tells blatant lies all the time example she gets into argument with me and while my mom is looking she will pretend shes fallen over and claim that i beat her and call the police or when she take things and will say that she hasnt taken it even though you caught her in the act gets away with it all the time because everyone is scared to confront her no one wants to deal with the drama i should just do the right thing and send her off to the mental institute but my mom cant handle it she is too attached to her and doesnt want to give up on her daughter every time i mention that the family would be together again if we just send her away but she refuses she says the hospital doesnt even let her visit plus every time they drug her up so much that she doesnt even recognise us however imo i think sacrificing one person in the family is better than destroying the whole family but the damage is already done and i think its already too late,pre-pandemic
tldr not sure if it would be for the best for me to go back to my normal job rather than take on more work responsibilities x200b a big change is on the horizon for work i currently am on a secondment as a personal assistant to one manager and have been doing so for a year now however the whole business admin department is to be restructured with the idea being one pa will support three managersim not sure if ill be able to cope with the increased workload currently i have my good and bad days supporting one person plus their department which happens to be where my main role as an admin assistant happens to sit ini can imagine looking after three and their separate departments is going to be really chaotic and may be too much for me i have gad and also help my parents look after my autistic brothers x200b i think i perform well in my currently role but my confidence is shaky and i feel at my limit with taking on additional duties ive been out of work in different jobs before due to stress and dont want to get to that place or burnout again x200b its awkward though because if i chose to revert back to my previous job rather than go for a new style pa position then im still in the department that the new pa would be looking after id feel like id be letting down the manager i suppose and my supervisor since it was they who suggested me for the pa work in the first place plus itd be embarrassing to admit i stepped back because i cant handle more work makes me seem lazy and difficult no one would trust me if i returned to my admin role and my pay would decrease not a drastic amount but enough to make me need to reconsider my monthly outgoings x200b but if i did apply and got the new style pa job permanently and had to supporting three managers it may be really stressful and tip me over the edge i dont know if i could in good faith accept the position if i could anticipate that it will be detrimental to not only myself down the line but to my family too and the workplace x200b i dont want to be out of work i want to be functional and do my best yet i fear my best is not going to happen if i looked after three though there is a part of me that wonders if it would be beneficial for my confidence to take on three managers and trust that it would work out i may be ok and worrying over nothing x200b then again i may either not have a choice and revert back to my admin role because im not permanently in place as a pa and theyd prioritise those whos main and only job is a pa or if we have to interview then id not necessarily be successful and would feel so guilty if i got a permanent pa job and it turned out i couldnt hack it whereas the person applying who didnt get it would either be downgraded or take redundancy x200b sorry for the long post im just trying to get my messy thoughts out there x200b theres so many unknowns to be honest and i think i do need more information as to what the role change looks like what my options are it wouldnt be happening for a month or so since work need to consult with all the pas before implementing anything theres time for me to reflect at leasti just dont know what i should prioritise or what would be the best for me i wish i didnt have this changing situation to contend with,post-pandemic
at this point it feels impossible to deal with if i say anything remotely out of line everyone always asks me if ive taken my meds yet if i act like myself everyone always backs away i just need to know how to deal with this i really need help from this sub because i know if i ask anywhere else people are gonna say your wonderfull or im sure youre a good person your just insecure but i know that im not a good person and that my personality is basically a dumpster fire everyone always tells me that they like me and they just dont like some certain part that i could work on and change but i cant that is me i am that part and no matter who i tell nobody understands please just tell me im not alone with this,post-pandemic
needing validation so i can get out this relapse and be accountable for my health plzzz tldr my brain isnt letting me take the steps i probably should to recover i feel really fake for even thinking my eating or thinking is abnormal i am the exception this is how it should be and actually i should be doing more to lose weight to have control theres nothing for me to be valid for im just attention seeking and dont like being fat and told im fat therefore want an excuse to just eat more and blame it on disordered eating and labelling it as validation basically i 21tm have had disordered eatingeating disorders since i was 8 years old and sadly not the skinny twink or cute gay guy type the chubby dad bod type except not even that good looking i grew up with binge eating disorder from 8 to bulimia at 12 to anorexia at 15 back to bulimia at 17 and binge eating again at 1819 with sporadic bulimic and anorexic behaviour cycles since then before this i hadnt had a restrictive relapse since xmas 2022 shout out to the halloweenchristmas triggered relapse ppl seasonal hell greetings and in march 2023 i had my final binge and started recovering no binge no purges and no diets following a regular eating pattern each day i felt okay albeit anxious and i did gain a bit ofweight that made me fall into the ow category and i also was changing due to starting hrt and i tend to sit on high end of normal naturally as much as i hate it these feel like excuses but looking back i still had many minor disordered behaviours and ive calorie counted every single day for the past 34 years even binge days anyways somewhere along the line im assuming october ish i saw my weight and bmi id been gym for 8 months consistently too so got muscle gain and decided i was too fat and if i didnt lose weight then my partner would hate me starve me weaponise how i looked back at me disclaimer he has never done any of this this is from parental trauma and i think i may have done a little slidy slide back into restriction and now im a healthier weight but starting to border on uw yet still look chunky essentially all my restriction behaviours have kicked in gradually and then super fast from october im scared of food and drinks eating childrens food weighing myself everyday and isolating myself and blocking out any event that involves food basically my disordered eating ruined yet another christmas and another birthday with its rules under the guise of health ironically i havent been intimate or nude or joined in on food nights with my partner because of not feeling deserving or good enough and telling myself he will like me more the more weight i losewhich im trying to hide ed logic yall anyways i realised once again that there is no goal or weight or look that i can achieve before i say yknow what think ill stop now i like myself i am worth something now etc its really not worth this misery and this gap in my life i hate that food is such a big part of my life and culture but my brain isnt letting me take the steps i probably should to recover i feel really fake for even thinking my eating or thinking is abnormal i am the exception this is how it should be and actually i should be doing more to lose weight to have control theres nothing for me to be valid for im just attention seeking and dont like being fat and told im fat therefore want an excuse to just eat more and blame it on disordered eating so as usual im seeking validation and reassurance from the internet because i just want attention and excuses but deep down my gut is telling me that what im doing isnt right other than telling me i wouldnt be 2 weeks constipated if i ate more how dare i even think about eating more lmao help,post-pandemic

i know this may not be the best place to ask haha but i feel like only people with this disorder will actually understand the issue and not just assume that im not trying tbh ive been trying to go to the library for a few weeks now but i cant because im scared to talk to the librarian to get a card im spending so much money on books i could easily borrow for free i dont go to coffee shops that feel more personal than costa coffee because the prospect of the barista recognising me and trying to chat and not knowing what to say is too much ive been wanting to go to a climbing gym for months but havent because im scared ill humiliate myself by not knowing what to do hell ive tried to apply to therapy three seperate times now and fucked it up every time because they require an intake call and i just cannot bring myself to answer it i dont even feel like i can apply again now because i dont want to waste their time any more i cant play online games i like unless my one extremely busy friend is online because i cant bring myself to enter a lobby full of stangers i might not get along with i failed university because of my anxiety this is just a few examples i find it hard to organise and do things at all to begin with and the fear just gives me another fucking heavy layer that makes it easier to just stay in bed and scroll on my phone while thinking of how goddamn bored and lazy i am i want to do things i want to make friends i kind of know how logically but emotionally i just dont think i can or at least i dont know how its awful i find the unknown is really scary to me if i dont know exactly what im supposed to do or what to expect its usually just too scary even when i do it still sometimes is but its worse when i dont its crippling ill have to do things in my life that are out of that comfort zone i know logically that no one grows by sitting in their comfort zone and honestly ive been sitting in the blasted zone for all 20 years of my life im getting head numbingly fucking bored to be honest but i just cant get through the fear,post-pandemic
i wonder if people without ptsd have any idea of just how exhausting it can be to live with it it tires me out on a daily basis my triggers are everywhere especially when i leave my place and venture out in public being constantly set off by these things is exhausting my heart races my muscles tense i start to growl im basically thrown into fightorflight mode all the time and dont get me started on the constant anxiety that forces me to be on hyper alert for my triggers even short trips to the convenience store a couple of blocks away can run me ragged by the time i get back it drains me so fast i keep thinking that i should just lock myself away in my room hidden from the outside world but that isnt realistic especially since i started working again in december i have to face it so i do it doesnt make it any easier in fact its twisting me in a way i have very angry and violent thoughts about hurting others as a result to add to the exhaustion dealing with those intrusive thoughts is exhausting in itself then theres the worm but thats a topic for a different subreddit why am i so tired all the time well ptsd is one of the reasons why,pre-pandemic
ive been seeing her for a month now for meds and psychotherapy its going good but i tell her that i get tired often and have suicidal thoughts because of the exposure therapy and that maybe she could increase my dosage or give me other meds so she did but then a week later she stopped one medication cause she saw i was doing better she then tells me if you get tired again just think of the good feeling after you do something out of your comfort zone i get what she means but that wont stop the suicidal thoughts idk if its just me overreacting and i should just follow my doctor,post-pandemic
i was reading up on some studies that showed a link between alcoholism and various gene mutations i believe that i have most definitely inherited some genes that are tied to alcoholism and probably addiction in general addiction runs on both sides with an emphasis on alcoholism this would imply that gene carriers have had this disposition their entire lives however treatment is a possibility if these gene carriers do start drinking excessively which implies that there is a psychological element to alcoholism i was wondering about how much impact that psychological element has if youre surrounded by heavy drinkers youll be more likely to do what they do but what if you arent if you were in a scene that discouraged excessive drinking and only had one drink would you feel the desire to continue drinking despite the stigma around it if that were your first drink im mostly asking this for myself since i want to know if i could handle a drink without falling victim to the cycle but im curious if thats really all it takes when you have a genetic predisposition to alcoholism im also generally just interested in how it begins since the science behind it is incredibly interesting and hopeful the existence of a genetic predisposition to alcoholism implies that one day in the future gene editing could help people kick their addictions for good,post-pandemic
hi everyone so after breaking up with my ex not my last ex but the one before that i went through a period of a few months were i struggled with anxiety being alone in my flat and general inability to sleep because of anxiety i also started experiencing this feeling of impending doom very close to a panic attack i suppose and regularly felt like i was about to have a panic attack without ever really having one my solution was to start drinking more so i could sleep which of course only makes anxiety worse all of this was even though i initiated the breakup as i understand it we lived together for long enough for me to become codependent with her then after a few months of drinking myself to sleep i got into a new relationship so my last ex now which lasted until around the end of last year and we lived together for most of it the relationship lasted around two years i of course never gave myself time to grow or learn to live alone again and now i am dealing with it again because i never dealt with it the first time around i guess i am struggling with how to fix this i never had issues living alone before my last two exes and these days i get these strong feelings of anxiety and impending doom when sitting alone in my flat and the only solutions ive found are to either smoke a bit of weed to cloud my brain a bit yes i know not a longterm solution or go for long walks and enjoy the accompanying blisters from walking for extended periods i just dont know how to stop these anxious feelings and feeling like im always about to have a panic attack whenever i return home to be alone any advice would be really appreciated,post-pandemic

my post got taken down because they dont want posts from family members of people with bipolar however i have been diagnosed with and am being treated for bipolar 2 and i would prefer advice from people who have experienced this disorder or who have been to psychiatric hospitals my original post i think my brother has bipolar and a personality disorder maybe but he doesnt seem capable of taking the necessary steps to get treatedwant to get treated hes against psychiatry and psychiatric medicines and regular medicine and vaccines and according to him hes been on everything and nothing works ive been on many different medications myself so i know that he hasnt been on everything hes been on two or three things only one of which was for bipolar and it was risperidone but i empathize with his frustration with the meds but still he thinks that the feds are listening to his phone conversations and spying on him as well as planting officers to make friends with him and cause discord in his personal life by telling the other people he interacts with all his personal information theres nothing i can say to convince him this isnt happening and if i do he accuses me of gaslighting him he also thinks hes thought broadcasting or saying all his thoughts aloud my mom is useless and this same thing happened to my sister 14 years ago and my mommoms family did nothing and my sister ended up being hospitalized for 7 years she has schizoaffective disorder does anyone have any advice on how to deal with this or personal experience with a family member with this kind of thing he also has type 2 diabetes and doesnt take insulin or anything sometimes he says that insulin doesnt even work he refuses to get vaccinated for covid despite being at higher risk due to comorbidities diabetes and has gotten covid like 3 times sometimes he threatens to kill himself but i feel like he doesnt really want to die he just wants to have a normal life but doesnt know how sometimes he talks about things and i try to tell him hes exhibiting symptoms of hypomania but he doesnt listen he got evicted from his apartment and has nowhere to gocant get a job its really scary and sad hes really unwell does anyone have any advice ive heard conflicting things about psychiatric hospitals i dont want my brother to end up in some kind of weird jail where they abuse him are there any good ones edit my mom said she would pay for him to go to a place like a nice inpatient place does anyone know of any or have been to one that helped them,post-pandemic

both direct and indirect incitement of suicide weve created a wiki that covers these issues we hope this will be helpful to anyone whos wondering whether somethings okay here and which responses to report it explains in detail why any validation of suicidal intent even an innocent message like if youre 100 committed ill just wish you peace is likely to increase peoples pain and why its important to report even subtle prosuicide comments the full text of the wikis current version is below and it is maintained at rsuicidewatchwikiincitement we deeply appreciate everyone who gives responsive empathetic nonjudgemental support to our ops and we particularly thank everyone whos already been reporting incitement in all forms please report any post or comment that encourages suicide or that breaks any of the other guidelines in the sidebar to the moderators either by clicking the report button or by sending us a modmail with a link we deal with all guideline violations that are reported to us as soon as we can but we cant read everything so community reports are essential if you get a pm that breaks the guidelines please report it both to the reddit sitewide admins and to us in modmail thanks to all the great citizens of the community who help flag problem content and behaviour for us rsuicidewatchwikiincitement summary its important to respect and understand peoples experiences and emotions its never necessary helpful or kind to support suicidal intent there are some common misconceptions discussed below about suicidal people and how to help them that can cause wellmeaning people to inadvertently incite suicide there are also people online who incite suicide on purpose often while pretending to be sympathetic and helpful validate feelings and experiences not selfdestructive intentions were here to offer support not judgement that means accepting with the best understanding we can offer whatever emotions people express suicidal people are suffering and were here to try to ease that by providing support and caring the most reliable way we know to deescalate someone at risk is to give them the experience of feeling understood that means not judging whether they should be feeling the way they are or telling them what to do or not do but theres an important line to draw here theres a crucial difference between empathizing with feelings and responding nonjudgmentally to suicidal thoughts and in any way endorsing encouraging or validating suicidal intentions or hopeless beliefs its both possible and important to convey understanding and compassion for someones suicidal thoughts without putting your finger on the scale of their decision anything that condones suicide even passively encourages suicide it isnt supportive and does not help it also violates reddits sitewide rules as well as our guidelines explicitly inciting suicide online is a criminal offense in most jurisdictions do not treat any ops post as meaning that will definitely die by suicide and cant change their minds or be helped anyone whos able to read the comments here still has a chance to choose whether or not to try to keep living even if theyve also been experiencing intense thoughts of suicide made a suicide plan or started carrying it out in the most useful empirical model we have the desire to die by suicide primarily comes from two interpersonal factors alienation and a sense of being a burden or having nothing to offer these factors usually lead to a profound feeling of being unwelcome in the world so any acceptance or reinforcement of suicidal intent even something innocent like i hope you find peace is actually a form of covert shunning that validates a persons sense that theyre unwelcome in the world it will usually add to their pain even if kindly meant and gently worded how to avoid validating suicidal intent keep the following in mind when offering support to anyone at risk for suicide people who say they dont want help usually can feel better if they get support that doesnt invalidate their emotions unfortunately many popular good responses are actually counterproductive in particular many friends and family tend to rely exclusively on trying to convince the suicidal person that its not so bad and this is usually experienced as i dont understand what youre going through and im not going to try people whove had help that made them feel worse dont want any more of the same it doesnt mean that someone who actually knows how to be supportive cant give them any comfort most people who are suicidal want to end their pain not their lives its almost never true that death is the only way to end these peoples suffering of course there are exceptional situations and we certainly acknowledge that for some people the right help can be difficult to find but preventing someones suicide doesnt mean prolonging their suffering if we do it by giving them real comfort and understanding an unfixable problem doesnt mean that a good life will never be possible we dont have to fix or change anything to help someone feel better its important to keep in mind that the correlation between our outer circumstances and our inner experience is weaker and less direct than commonly assumed for every kind of difficult life situation you will find some people who lapse into suicidal despair and others who cope amazingly well and a whole spectrum in between a key difference is how much inner resilience the person has at the time this can depend on many personal and situational factors but when theres not enough interpersonal support can both compensate for its absence and help rebuild it we go into more depth on the it gets better issue in this psa post which is always linked from our sidebar community info on mobile guidelines there are always more choices than brutally forcing someone to stay alive or passively letting them end their lives to avoid accidentally breaking the antiincitement rule dont say or try to imply that acting on suicidal thoughts is a good idea or that someone cant turn back or is already dead do whatever you can to help them feel cared for and welcome at least in this little corner of the world our talking tips offer more detailed guidance look out for deliberate incitement it may come in disguise often comments that subtly encourage suicidal intent actually come from suicide fetishists and voyeurs unfortunately this is a real and disturbing phenomenon people like this are out there and the anonymous nature of reddit makes us particularly attractive to them they will typically try to scratch their psychological itch by saying things that push people closer to the edge they often do this by exploiting the myths that we debunked in the bullet points above specifically you might see people doing the following encouraging the false belief that the only way suicidal people can end their pain is by dying there are always more and better choices than brutally forcing someone to stay alive or helping actively or passively them to end their lives creating an artificial and toxic sense of solidarity by linking their encouragement of suicide to empathy they will represent themselves as the only one who really understand the suicidal person while either directly or indirectly encouraging their selfloathing emotions and selfdestructive impulses since most people in suicidal crisis are in desperate need to empathy and understanding this is a particularly dangerous form of manipulation many suicide inciters are adept at putting a benevolent spin on their activities while actually luring people away from sources of real help a couple of key points to keep in mind skilled suicide intervention peer or professional is based on empathic responsiveness to the persons feelings that reduces their suffering in the moment contrary to popculture myths it does not involve persuasion dont do it cheerleading youve got this or meaningless false promises trust me it gets better or invalidation let me show you how things arent as bad as you think anyone who leads others to expect these kinds of toxic responses or any other response that prolongs their pain from expert help may be covertly prosuicide of course people sometimes do have bad experience when seeking mentalhealth treatment and its fine to vent about those but processing our own disappointment and frustration is entirely different from trying to destroy someone elses hope of getting help choices made by competent responders are always informed by the understanding that breaching someones trust is traumatic and must be avoided if possible any kind of involuntary intervention is an extremely unlikely outcome when someone consults a clinician or calls a hotline confidentiality is addressed in more detail in our hotlines faq post the goal is always to provide all help with the clients full knowledge and informed consent we know that no individual or system is perfect mistakes that lead to bad experiences do sometimes happen to vulnerable people and we have enormous sympathy for them but anyone who suggests that this is the norm might be trying to scare people away from the help they need please let us know discreetly if you see anyone exhibiting these or similar behaviours we dont recommend trying to engage with them

so i got on clonidine for my sleep problems a week ago was previously on trazodone but it made me gain 20 pounds in the span of a few months i tapered off it which sucked a lot but thats a whole other story it works great on weeknights when ive gotta wake up at 430 to take my adderall and wake up for real at 530 to shower and eat breakfast before work at 7 cause it feels like i can cram 8 hours of sleep into 4 or 5 and not feel like death until 9am like trazodone made me but on weekends this stuff really kinda sucks i went to bed pretty early last night and only got like 5 hours of sleep before i woke up at 3am super hot and jittery and couldnt get back to sleep until almost 6am no matter how hard i tried its really weird this stuff seems like a double edged sword great for sleep on weeknights but if i use it on a weekend im completely trashed cause i sleep in 4hour increments and only even wake up when the days halfway over feeling like crap anybody got any tricks for it,post-pandemic

tw i talk a lot about binging food and how i ended up with bed a ton of body dysmorphia but after spending some time in this community it turns out im not a part of me is heartbroken because i know how cruel and awful and terrible eds can be but another part of me is looking around feeling less like a freak because oh hey ive had that experience too i was born in the land of kpop and kbeauty south korea baby where every woman around me seemed to be able to adhere to korean beauty standards but ive always been round as a kid with muscular legs especially i snowboarded from when i was 8 to 18 and was also an instructor and a racer for a few years i also just loved food and eating and very much did notcould notadhere to everyone else i went to bed often hungry as a kid because i was only allowed to eat a certain amountcertain foods and my mom would freak out if she caught me eating other things after i started making my own money doing parttime work i hid food and binged like crazy she didnt neglect to give me dinner or anything they were normal portionsi just ate more than others at baseline i think my mom would often give me different meals than my sibling though they were also a picky eater but i definitely wasnt allowed to have snacks like they could she would also take food from my plate to take away some of the calories as a result i am extremely territorial over my food and i will literally slap someone if they try to take any korean people especially elders seem to think its within their rights to say you look fat or youd look so much prettier with a few pounds off or youve gained weight at my current weight i now think i look fat ugly and apparentalmost too visible because of my size thanks guys i ditched home as fast as possible for university ended up ballooning in weight gained almost 40 kg 90 lbs in the span of three months once i realized i could eat whatever i wanted whenever i wanted to i felt extreme shame to the point where i developed social anxiety i have a hard time looking at people in the eye i havent gone back to korea in almost eight years after the weight gain i am on an island with no one but me and a reflection of who ive become i feel that my life has no worth no value and is devoid of love because of how i look suffice to say ive felt like a freak an outsider someone who is worth less than dirt almost all of my lifecertainly all of my adult life but reading about stories here im starting to think im not the only person on this island and its empowering to know that its not just me and im not here because its just me that my problems are real and valid and maybe even a bit common selfblame is encouraged when youre a bigger person in this century so ive been trapped constantly thinking me me me this was the first time ive seen us and that maybe im not so isolated i used to compete professionally in a sport not snowboarding that i gave up after i gained weight but the current champions are exactly my age and a little bit younger and i resent myself for not being able to play very high impact sport would probably shatter my bones if i tried now i recently met my favourite athlete and i could only say that i retired seven years ago instead of being able to say i want to compete again because i was too afraid of being judged old friends new friends who i havent seen in a while or have never met inperson have expressed interest in dating or even just meeting up but ive shot them down because im so convinced that im unlovable in my body i feel trapped i have a therapist who specializes in eds who is wonderful and i might write a post on the things shes said because ive genuinely found it helpful if it doesnt break any rulesi might do a draft for the mods first i dont know what life is like not hating myself without binging or obsessing over food but i really hope to see all of you guys on the flip side happy and content because we all deserve it right now im taking it slow i dont label food ive told my family to their face how much they fucked me up and anyone who says anything about my food will never hear from me again i will only listen to my therapist when it comes to food and food recommendations which she has none because foods arent good and badyou can enjoy them without guilt i try to eat when i feel hungry without guilt or shame and im hiking more and more my stamina has improved a ton i no longer get shooting pains down my feet after 20k steps and food is still really hard for me but the obsession ebbs and flows more some days are better than others and in real life i still feel isolated because im the only plussized person in my friend group navigating health and peace in this environment is tough but i appreciate everyone telling their stories because its made me realize im not as alone as i thought i miss competing i miss going on dates but im going to keep pursuing therapy and genuine health whatever the fuck that means because i deserve it for anyone else going through this and even to those who are here because they didnt feel like they were enough that the people around you couldnt love you because of the way you looked and for those who are waiting to live their lives after hitting a certain weightknow that i hear you and i feel your pain so damn much eds make your body feel like prison but worse because were not being punished for harming someone else were being punished for who we are because others and their expectations and their words have hurt us the things we do especially for bed feels counterintuitive and the blame makes me bigger but the prison room smaller i get that i dont know how to get out myself though im trying really hard but in the meanwhile take care of yourselves because there is worth that we can see in each other that we simply struggle to see in ourselves,post-pandemic

anyone i know i prefer to keep my distance not talking everyday or hangout otherwise my mind cant stop talking nonsense when they act the slightest of change which gets me insane i start assuming things that are not logical nonsense literally i be like they hate me just because they didnt say hello or talk to me that day and i dont even have a reason for that i be aware of what s my mind telling me just cant stop believing it whatever i do to not and its literally ruining every relation i have with anyone because i usually end up splitting losing that person which makes them act on what i thought in the first place that makes me struggle to talk to ppl regularly because ill gt attached and then they just in a never ending circle,post-pandemic

i told a coworker a few weeks ago that i had a doctors appointment and he asked why i couldnt think of a lie in time so i just told him because i have ptsd which was the truth his response was you were in the service i said no my dad was a piece of shit to which he just said oh yeah me too and we stopped talking about it pretty shortly after that im not really angry about it or anything just bored enough to complain about it but i hate how everyone assumes that if you have ptsd you must have served in the military just weird to me that nobody thinks of all the other possibilities,pre-pandemic
quick info been to the er probably 7 times since march of 2018 due to nearly every symptom you find when you look up anxiety heart attack and angina chest painpressure left shoulder paindiscomfort lightheadedness shortness of breath clammy handsfeet etc each time they do an ekg xrays and blood work that shows no sign of heart attack or damage to heart muscle i even had a nuclear stress test done in august 2018 that came back negative as well to this day i still experience the symptoms but as of the past week the pain in the left side of my chest has been more constant and sharp ive also been experiencing increased tingling and numbing from my right hand that extends all the way to the right side of my face that lasts for a minute or two and then goes away another thing i will add is that i am a heavy drinker i dont drink every day but tend to go on binges that last several days i am sure my alcoholism could be contributing to my condition but i will still have these symptoms even on the days in between even when i havent drank for weeks on end it doesnt seem feasible to keep going to the er and getting stress tests especially when i am uninsured at what point do you just submit and tell yourself that if youre going to have a heart attack or stroke just let it happen to get it over with who else can you talk to to get a definitive answer on what exactly is going wrong inside your body,pre-pandemic

did you ever think you had schizophrenia after you developed ptsd i ask because i was originally diagnosed with unspecified schizophrenia following my trauma that being said i never heard voices or had hallucinations i honestly believe that because im autistic and also have ptsd i came off as a bit weird and the eccentricity combined with the hypervigilance made me appear psychotic to the psychiatrist im curious if any of you have had a similar experience,post-pandemic
last may my fianc cheated on me 25ftm my best friend since high school and his wife my former middle school bully sided with my fianc after i ended it because i was a trans man and should just be grateful for what i had i was making a lot of personal progress and became close friends with one of my coworkers shes married in an open relationship so we occasionally hook up however ive recently tried to start dating again but it is not going well i hangout with my friend every couple weeks and everytime i see her interact with her husband i am jealous not of him getting to love her because i genuinely have not caught feelings i want someone to look at me the way he looks at her i want to look at someone the way she looks at him i want someone to hold me when im having a breakdown and tell me its going to be okay i want to hold someone in their darkest hour and be their comfort but the only serious relationships ive been in have ended because she was physically and emotionally abusive and dumped me the day after i took her to my brothers wedding or she cheated on me then made me feel guilty and pitted my former best friend against me to top it off i was talking to my friend yesterday and she told me that they are thinking about adding a third to their relationship because of all the benefits financially and with raising children to be clear i would not be their third as he is not attracted to me which is totally fine and i truly want what is best for my friend and what is going to make her and her husband happy i guess im just wondering if anyone else has experienced anything similar,post-pandemic

a little background i used to be homeless off and on for 3 years in west dallas luckily i met a girl and we are able to stay at her moms out in the country down south well anyway we use fetty and still make a trip every couple of weeks to dallas to score sometimes we end up staying for several days and sleep in our car or we will crash with various random friends at their houses so anyway several of the people who i used to live with out here all those years ago are still here when i come up i try to help them out when i can recently one by one all of the people living under a certain bridge started breaking out in these gnarly sores a couple of them use the needle but the majority of them only smoke it their plug has arguably the best fetty in dallas so almost everyone i know who uses scores from this same plug up until about 3 weeks ago that is my girl and i ended up linking up with an old plug of mine whose fetty was of decent quality he also takes our merch as payment so we havent been using the same dope as everyone else lately within a weeks period of time i went back to the bridge where one of my good friend lives just to check on him and i was shocked to see the state of his health and some of the others that live there apparently a friend of one of their other custos from the suburbs would go under the bridge to smoke with them every time he went to score when he started noticing these sores he went to the doctor and they admitted him to the hospital right away he said that the infection got into his blood stream and that he has endocarditis he said they began surgery to remove spots that were growing on his neck he said that they told him that he had been exposed to a flesh eating bacteria that passes from skin to skin contact before that we had all been thinking that the sores were from the dope like many stories we had been hearing about xylazine from the north eastern united states i went to check on my friends immediately to warn them mind you it had only been about a week since i had seen them and within a weeks period of time these had spread all over my friends body including his face i took these pictures of one of my buddies to ask the people of reddit what they think of this another friend of mine who used to be a lean mean fighting machine who fought mma won belts and taught childrens fighting classes sometimes goes on 4 or 5 day benders where he stays under the bridge and smokes fetty and ice with the homeless guys there and then he returns home to his kids and wife well i saw him today hobbling along because he couldnt walk right he had lost so much muscle and weight he showed me his back and ass cheeks along with his arms and chest he said he even had a sore on his pecker well anyway he said that he had gone to the doctor as well and the doc told him it was an infection from the cut that they are using in the dope i felt so overwhelmed i want to help but i need to consider the health of my girl and i the last straw was when he started picking at a sore on his elbow and squeezed it and banana colored pus squirted out i wouldnt let him in my car to smoke i gave him a little piece because he was in so much pain and i drove my girl and i away having a full blown anxiety attack these are my friends and i care about them but i cant risk exposing the love of my life to this i cant figure it out though none of this sits right with me because it seems that other people who go through their plug and smoke the shit are just fine no sores or spots it makes me wonder if there is something under that bridge itself that is contagious or what the fuck is happening to my friends tldr either a flesh eating bacteria is spreading among the homeless in west dallas of the cut some of the best quality fetty in the city is having a necrotizing effect on some of its users,post-pandemic
i have made an important realization id like to share because maybe itll resonate with others to preface this i am one of the worst hypochondriacs youll ever meet i obsess about all sorts of nasty illnesses that i am extremely unlikely to ever experience i have wasted hundreds of hours on medical papers websites and many dollars on unnecessary medical expenses the truth is that my obsession with illness is a symptom of a deeper existential crisis i dont see any meaning in life other than actually being alive therefore being alive and avoiding serious lifethreatening illness is the highest possible goal within my frame of personal meaning by preoccupying myself with health and with ill health i feel that obsessing about these things is my only purpose because it achieves a continuation of living but that achievement is to the detriment of actually enjoying my existence and immersing in it fully i am not sure what this means in terms of actually overcoming this horrible affliction if my only value system is simply to be alive and to survive everything else that could provide meaning becomes unimportant,pre-pandemic

i wish i had dyslexia autism or schizophrenia at least then people would get it noone says to dyslexics i find it hard to read text sometimes too try reading slowly theres nothing wrong with you to our autistic crew just think about what the implication of a statement is just dont get overwhelmed change is good to paranoid schizophrenic gang i feel like the radio is talking directly to me too sometimes and i saw a facebook ad about shoes after looking at shoes online maybe theyre following all of us even writing this crushes me i know there are some thatll read this and think just try harder good god im trying i get the feeling you get when youre hyping yourself up to jump off a 10m diving board when i open my emails ps ive recently become medicated holy shit scary as fuck to admit theres something wrong but what a difference i can have a plan and do the plan i wish i could explain the difference to people that dont already know what i mean edit this community is amazing so encouraging and supportive you all really helped me and people reading this thread to not feel like so isolated as an adult with newly diagnosed adhd its tough it feels like theres been a monumental shift in who i am and how i view myself and my perceived failures yet everyone around me sees the same old lovable but somewhat useless person ive always been,pre-pandemic
ive never posted here before but i scroll this sub whenever im having a rough day so i thought i would share my story today makes two years for me i never ever in a million years thought i would be able to say that never thought id be strung out on heroin and cocaine either but here we are my trip through hell all started with a percocet and a cute boy that told me id really like it to this day i dont blame him because i made my own choices but that is where it started within a month of trying opiates for the first time i was traveling out of state to buy heroin and selling it to support our habit life felt unreal i felt untouchable until i got arrested with 200 tickets crossing state lines i remember so vividly the dea agent telling me someday you will thank me i probably saved your life and he was right so thank you tony milligan from maine dea for possibly saving my life sorry for puking in your car i did not get the drugs from your wife obviously like i said i did and you can unfuck yourself now you did save my life i did 14 months in prison have 5 years hanging and 4 years probation i have class a b and c felonies on my record but i wouldnt change a single thing because im alive im in a healthy relationship i dont wake up sick anymore my first thought in conflict is no longer getting fucked up i know there is a huge debate on incarcerating drug addicts and i 100 agree that it shouldnt be the answer in fighting addiction but nothing else would have gotten me clean i had tried rehabs iop 12 step meetings suboxone my brain was sick and the only thing that gave me relief was being locked up they say its jails institutions or death prison got me clean plain and simple im just thankful for life today thanks for listening,pre-pandemic
while typing this out feeling a mix of hope and vulnerability its late and in moments like these i cant help but wish i had someone to talk tonot just small talk cause yourebored but a real meaningful conversation im that person whos always there for everyone else no matter the time of day 3 am no problem but finding someone who offers the same it feels like searching for a needle in a haystack are you someone who gets that life is messy and complicated but is ready to ride through it together someone who sees beyond the usual stuff like what we look like or where we come from im talking about a bond thats built on understanding mutual respect and genuine care i know this might sound desperate maybe it is but isnt there a kind of beauty in admitting we need each other in a world thats always rushing im here reaching out for something real i miss having that person who i can laugh with over silly jokes share my weirdest thoughts with or just sit in silence without it being awkward maybe this is all just a fairy tale thought and the modern world is messed up beyond repair for anything like this,post-pandemic
im in some mixed episode i have like an overwhelming desire to escape im laying on the floor in my dorm in the dark losing my mind im so mentally physically uncomfortable im so tense paranoid i just want my mind to be quiet for 1 second no matter how good my life is going im just constantly suffering inside my head suicide has literally been on my mind 24 hours a day the past week the thoughts are only getting worse i really dont wanna have to kms but i think its the best option i would love to go to the hospital stay there for a while but i really cant afford to start my life over again its a miracle im in university i have a gf a job i know if i went inpatient for a couple weeks id lose it all and the grief would be unbearable it just sounds so depressing which is why suicide seems like the lesser of the two evils but i also really am not looking forward to going through with it is there something else besides inpatient suicide sorry making a post like this is really unlike me but im desperate id like to live any advice is appreciated other than like calling suicide selfish any other of the dumb things ppl commonly say to suicidal ppl telling me that im so young tytyty im very grateful ppl are so nice i hope everyone is doing well im so sorry for the blah post i wish i had a joke to make to make this more lighthearted but i cant think of anything 3 3 3,post-pandemic
i tried i really did but the second i took the pills i instantly regretted it i called 911 in the ambulance is when i really noticed what i had done and having the paramedics there to calm me down and help me was everything to me im currently in the hospital i cant leave my room unless its to go to the bathroom i cant even close my curtain to get privacy they took every single cable and metal object out of the room im in terrible pain i didnt sleep at all last night hospital beds are the worse i miss my bed and my dog despite the dreary scene of the hospital the nurses and doctors have been nothing but nice and supportive the nurse who drew my blood even drew a little smiley face on my bandaid to cheer me up a little one nurse even gave me her number in case i ever need some support ive never been treated so nicely by a group of strangers every single one of them giving me a different purpose to live thankfully i didnt ingest too much pills to damage my body too much just slight kinda damage but nothing life threatening but this has made me realize a lot life really is worth living no matter your situation there are plenty of people who can be there for you every single nurse and doctor here gave me thousands of resources to help me and this has given me the will to live i should be getting out by tuesday when a psychiatrist comes to mentally evaluate me and give me permission to leave until then im in a hospital room prison being watched over like a baby but its good to know that theres people out there who truly care to all the people considering suicide please dont do it its not worth it i truly thought i had no one and my family wouldnt care but seeing their crying faces when the ambulance took me away made me realize that even when you think you have no one youre wrong the selfish decision i made will be in my mind forever but it gives me a reason to go on were all strong enough if we really try stay strong and reconsider your choice edit i didnt think my post would get so much attention seeing as my other posts wouldnt get much im sorry if i cant reply to all of the comments its really a lot however thank you to all the kind people and positive messages im glad to see my story is helping others as well,pre-pandemic

i19nb havent done proper like more than one time appointments therapy in a couple of years because of how badly things were with my last couple therapistscounsellors and im getting to the point where i think i need to speak to someone more consistently again but i dont know how to make myself feel like comfortable enough to try that again lore i had a really good relationship with a therapist for about 4 years and things really worked out with her she was the first therapist i actually really clicked with until she had to leave that job with very little warning and i freaked out about it and cut all contact with her the person she referred me to next was horrible and really did not want to be around me at all regularly canceledforgot about appointments and wouldnt let me know until i had already showed up at his office or would tell me he would text me when the next appointment was and then never contact me that kinda stuff after while of that i freaked out and and told him i never wanted to see him again then blocked all contact with him now of course i am feeling very unwilling to put myself into a situation where something like either of those things could happen again but at the same time i dont wanna end up in the hospital because i couldnt deal with my shit in a normal way i feel quite stuck in this decision making process and im not sure what to do normally in a situation like this i would let things get as bad as possible before i made a decision but im trying to be better now and not let it get to that point any advice would be appreciated thx,post-pandemic

im no expert and i know everyone is different but ive come a long way with my health anxiety and wanted to share a little of what i learned on mobile excuse format and typos i once read something along the lines of our brain believes everything we tell it so if we start filling it with doubt and anxiety we create a world that is simply not true a year ago and i was telling myself every little symptom meant imminent death i worried about brain cancer breast cancer blood cloths etc etc etc im still in the process of completely desensitize myself from the most minimal sensations and im still trying to learn how to really understand what my body is trying to tell me this is kind of how i learned to deal with it again i know not everyone is the same but hopefully this will be useful for someone 1 if i can distract myself from the sensation or discomfort then its anxiety i call them sensations because any little thing i feel i wanna convince myself is pain even if its not i try to ignore it if thats the case my doctor always told me small sensations or symptoms are not a sign of anything serious 2 if its interrupting your day to day then take something for your symptom and try to move on eg you have a sore throat then get something specifically for that 3 if over the counter meds dont do it and its well over a week or so then ill call my doctor explain whats going on and see if i can come in for some answers and peace of mind if you have multiple terrible symptoms then of course go check with your doctor asap but the main thing is breathe friend dont freak out immediately dont google about it try to accept the thought and the sensations as exactly that thoughts and sensations and nothing more theyre not a sign of anything you wont heal your mind in a day but in time things will get better ironically life is not guaranteed for anybody no matter what but looking for symptoms constantly means youre wasting something you want to hold on to so desperately think about that i do it everyday,pre-pandemic

hi everyone ive seen the word neurotypicals thrown around a couple of times today it seems like it cropped up recently i understand the use of the word but i dont think its a healthy distinction to be dwelling on yeah we all have different than average brain chemistry but i dont think we should be that polarizing using it like a slur almost sounds like incels complaining about chads fucking stacys theres my two cents,pre-pandemic
i was semi diagnosed at 26 but this last week i got a fully official adhd diagnosis by my psychiatrist it just feels very validating to know that this silent struggle ive felt my whole life is very real im not lazy im not unmotivated im not just not paying attention adhd paralysis is real over stimulation is real like a lot of late diagnosis in life folks ive developed a lot of other coping mechanisms to deal with my adhd but it feels good to know that i actually have the diagnosis that gives me access to resources and allows me to be taken seriously just feels like a win and i wanted to share,post-pandemic
so ive strongly suspected for a long time ive had adhd had symptoms since i was a little kid and my provider started me on antidepressants to rule out that i was depressed well those arent really working i mean my emotions are maybe more regulated but i still just lay in bed a lot of the time wiggling my legs around unable to get started on my day its very frustrating i took the tova test earlier this month and got a 44 im going to ask for medication and my therapist also thinks that would be a good idea seeing as i keep falling further and further behind in my life will my upcoming appointment with my psychiatrist be the day i finally get medication or are they gonna run further tests on me thank you for reading this is my first time getting this far into getting help for this and i dont know what to expect,post-pandemic
i have inattentive type adhd and have recently started taking meds the issue is my meds although make my brain somewhat quite to do some productive worki still seek out cheap dopamine from activities like mindless scrolling of instagram or watching shows and maladaptive daydreaming i have recently met a guy in office who is my type physically but i hate everything else about him he has gradually become a good friend of mine and although nervous when talking with other girlsis very candid in his conversations with mehe is misogynistic has anger issues and believes that he is a great catch and is always complaining about why he is single generally these qualities turn me off but idk why i find myself thinking about him doing things for him and daydreaming about being physical with him i feel that i like the thrill of chasing him and once he ends up liking me i will get bored surely some part of me feels unattractive so maybe chasing him and making him like me is a way of proving to myself that i am up to the high standards he has for attractive girls all this has led me to waste a lot of time thinking or doing things i am not proud of its hampering my academic aspirations and i realize that this is a cheap way of getting dopamine pls suggest how i can get over this situation,post-pandemic
every time there is a shooting on the news every fucking time its all over my facebook all over reddit news articles basically everywhere this is a mental health crisis ive seen people openly advocate national registries which would severely limit our rights ive seen people advocate for involuntary confinement regardless of whether an individual is showing symptoms of their illness ive seen comments as severe as round them up and put them down it doesnt take a lot of digging to find research that shows mental illness isnt the problem multiple articles ive found say that less than 5 of violent crime is perpetrated by individuals with a diagnosable mental illness its mental illness is simply an easy answer were a scapegoat the vast majority of us are not dangerous at all and it makes me very upset to see us painted as murderous lunatics,pre-pandemic

a lot of people toss the term bipolar arounds like its nothing they think that because theyve had something uncomfortable happen and it changes their mood into an ugly one then someone comes and brightens their day that theyre bipolar having a bad day then it turns into a good does not make you bipolar life fucking sucks sometimes and sometimes youre sad sometimes youre happy but that doesnt make you bipolar living with bipolar disorder is so much more than that its looking at something and experiencing love as youve never felt before its looking at the shade of colors in the trees and the flowers looking at how vibrant everything is sometimes you can even fucking feel the glow of the colors at least i do feeling like you can do anything in the world like youre unstoppable you begin to take on so many projects because your energy feels like it comes from the source and it feels great honestly you never want it to end you hardly need any sleep and you have an altruistic attitude towards everything youve been feeling like this for weeks now you have the most positive attitude ever then when it hits it fucking hits and it fucking hits hard the depression that follows is completely debilitating its obstacle after obstacle like youre just barricaded in your depression and theres not a way out there are times where you dont even want to get out of bed it consumes you you lay there thinking about how everything is miserable and you feel like youre not good enough you just want to be crossed out you want to be gone asleep you build up these walls these barriers that are hard to tear down no matter how hard you try you cant break them down and it feels like theyre going to cave burying you in its stones of negativity living with bipolar disorder is more than just having mood swings its feeling like youre the best version of yourself and you really vibe with it and so does everyone else around you only to crash so hard that you want to die and being forgotten because you arent who you used to be anymore but people pick up on it because you do it in cycles it starts becoming predictable and youre like a ticking time bomb,pre-pandemic

first time redditor long time sufferer x200b x200b the title says it all ive been struggling with hypochondria and gad for years but have had a particularly bad couple months recently like so many of you my anxiety produces so many random and unusual symptoms and every time i feel something new or unusual im left compulsively reading every medical publication on what it could potentially mean and then relentlessly calling all my friends who are in the medical field seeking reassurance that i am not on deaths doorstep x200b x200b but then i stumbled upon this community x200b x200b reading all of your posts has truly helped me start challenging my ohsocorrupted thought process youve helped me acknowledge just how complex a monster anxiety is and how many symptoms with supposedly nothing but ominous causes can indeed be attributed to anxiety x200b x200b but the most important posts in this entire subreddit are the ones talking about reassurance and how it is comparable to a drug nothing could be a more accurate description of how addicted and dependent ive become on hearing the words everything seems fine it seems to be a common theme among the success stories in this community that breaking ties with google and incessant doctors appointments are the first steps to recovery well im happy to say that today i took that first step when i woke up this morning i promised myself that every time i felt a pain or something unpleasant and that massive urge to open up webmd started to come on i was going to turn off my phone and walk away from it it was not easy at all every minute that went by that i didnt do research i felt like doom was closing in on me for hours the anxiety worsened until i was on the verge of having full blown panic attacks x200b but then things started slowing down i realized my original symptoms that were triggering me had subsidedand in time my fight or flight response had mostly stood down as im typing this i still am very much on edge and am still feeling that crippling impulse and i know i still have a long road ahead of me but this was a big victory for me a big first step x200b x200b thank you for taking the time to read i look forward to getting to know all of you and offering up what support i can,pre-pandemic

firstly i know im not right but im being kicked out of the house because im addicted to medication and alcohol but i ask my family for help and they told me that this is my problem but a depressed addict cant see a future where everything will get better i cant do it alone my plan is to try to stay clean by half the year but every addict knows it doesnt work like that i have psychological problems that have always been neglected by my family so are they right for me to abandon i just need one person to support me and i have no one but if nothing goes right then im going to put my plan into practice suicide i think it will be better for everyone especially for me this is the only solution i can imagine,post-pandemic
anxiety sufferers tend to have a habit of wanting one thing certainty certainty that their symptoms arent malignant when they get reassurances from their doctors you know what they need even more certainty its not their fault theyre dealing with this one thing about anxiety many people dont realize is that anxietys job is to heighten the possibility that the most devastating option is the most likely one if there is one phrase i hear constantly from people i help to help recover from anxietypanic is yeah but what if to be honest it gets me frustrated i also empathize because that phrase was part of my vocabulary when i dealt with anxiety and panic it wasnt till i found this hidden piece during my recovery that i stopped using that phrase began making leaps and strides now this hidden piece once revealed will make repulse many people on this post hang in there i promise its not what you think the missing piecewas faith and no im not referring to the faith in a higher power religious faith etc i mean faith in the most fundamental sense i mean faith in the ability to go into the unknown with the hope that everything will be okay avoidance will only make your anxiety grow and become generalized hence generalized anxiety its only when we go through the anxiety does anxiety lose its control and freedom becomes attainable once i got the knowledge of the mechanics of anxiety and understood how anxiety tricks us into thinking we have some malignant disease i made huge strides but that itself was not enough i needed to rely on the faith that everything was going to be okay in order for me to have the courage to face my anxiety and fully recover i needed to rely on something when i started doing things that made me push my comfort zones for me i had instilled faith on someone who had also suffered and recovered he wasnt a doctor he wasnt a therapistbut he understood how the mind worked more importantly this person knew how anxiety worked he saw what i was suffering with and helped me through full recovery he made me do things that i didnt feel confident in doing but i had to instill some faith in the fact that things would get better otherwise i knew for sure i wouldnt recover im saying recognize in your recoverythere will be moments you will need to have some faith regardless of what your mind is telling you relying on someone who is objective is very helpful in moments like these especially someone who has recovered also realize that this reliance on someone isnt permanent eventually this faith will be transferred into confidence in yourself which in terms will lead to a upward spiral to recovery eventually i dont like posting nuanced posts like these because i feel like it can easily be misunderstood but i couldnt help post this info because it was just so valuable in my recovery and often so neglected hope this helps,pre-pandemic
ive spent the last two days in a hospice room holding the hand of the man i believed was my soulmate for over 5 years he is dying of end stage liver failure he was a good sweet kind man and he adored me in the beginning over time it became apparent that he had been covering up his lifetime of alcoholism and he deteriorated when i say he was an alcoholic i dont mean he drank a lot occasionally through multiple hospitalizations and one stint in rehab i found that he had been secretly drinking a fifth of vodka a day for years he hid his stumbling and slurring through jokes his deteriorating digestive symptoms through claiming to have a new virus every couple of weeks he argued and lied and he denied denied denied he slept through the days and drank secretly through the nights even when confronted with a dozen empty bottles and a dozen water bottles filled with his dark brown urine he could only say he was sorry he knew he was sick but he said he couldnt stop when his behavior became mean defensive and demented at times i ended our relationship over a year ago we have remained best friends texting every night and ive tried over and over to convince him to stop drinking hes always claimed he quit ten days ago he was hospitalized and he called to say he loved me seven days ago he texted me lovingly joking for the last time three days later his brother texted six months tops and there could be no further treatment he could go home to his mothers and stay there for palliative care to live out his remaining days and three days ago the hospital sent him to hospice instead he is no longer conscious he is in pain his mother asked me to visit i drove an hour and a half to the hospice yesterday he had not even moved in a couple days and he never stirred the whole time i was there i went again today and though he was still unconscious he rolled over to me to nuzzle my hand as i stroked his face and scratched his head talking about all the good times and his loving family who were all there he tried repeatedly to sit up eyes still closed unable to speak and as i held his hand he stuck his arm straight up apparently trying to pull me closer to him he nodded each time i told him i love him so i know he knows i was there i am just heartbroken i will go back tomorrow and hug him until the end love the man hate the disease,pre-pandemic

let me get this straight i have what i would call a pretty mild form of health anxiety i went to my yearly checkup about a week ago and let my doctor know all of my bodily concerns sure i should stop eating so much crap and exercise more but turns out im healthy in most every way i got to thinking i dont give my body nearly enough credit bodies are amazingly capable of adapting and fighting disease and pushing the limits they go right much more often than they go wrong seriously i know what some of you battle is much more severe than what i deal with but i hope youll remember that as long as you take care of your body your body for the most part will take care of you heres to giving our amazing bodies the credit they deserve,pre-pandemic

f20 as early as sixth grade ive displayed symptoms of health anxietyocd every holiday breaks when my mind isnt constantly stimulated and im stuck in the house i find myself constantly fixated on a health issue from heart failure brain tumor als leukemia everything however when school resumes and im once again occupied with academics i dont fixate anymore or at least very little only but this year was different were barely eight weeks in 2024 but ive had multiple themes from schizophrenia trigerred by a reddit post cryptic pregnancy btw im a virgin trigerred by a delayed period tetanus trigerred by doing my nails and once again schizophrenia during these times i literally experience physical symptoms such as nausea puking related to pregnancy and jaw pain related to tetanus but then right now im fixating on the thought that i may be developing schizophrenia two weeks ago i was laying in bed when i think i saw a rat climbing on my bed side i got spooked and when i was about to shoo it away its nowhere to be found less than 5 seconds in my first thought was that was a hallucination decided to not dwell again on it until a similar thing happened days later i was lying down in same position when i thought i saw an ant in my bedside again memories of what happened prior flash back and when i was about to look for it it was genuinely gone i was on the verge of a panic attack i told my boyfriend about this but he said that it might really be difficult to look for that ant as my room was dark with only my night light on days later it turned out there was a rat that my mom was trying to catch around the house and dead ants outside my room as my mom just sprayed on them but i was still scared genuinely scared weeks have passed and i cant seem to shake the thought that i may be developing schizophrenia in fact it manifested to more visual pseudohallucinations for example i kept on mistaking things on my peripheral as bugs as i read theyre a common hallucination among people w schz ive got intense eye floaters tiny movement from my peripheral and my brain will try to perceive what is it and think that im hallucinating i thought of my clothes hung at my door as a person tiny speck of dirt id immediately think of as ants in fact i thought i saw a human shadow on our television turned out that it was the details of our door for weeks ive also been reading about this disorder and i think ive been manifesting their symptoms policing my thought process and reviewing my behavior ive read that schz diagnozed are paranoid about stuff like being followed and watched and all of a sudden im thinking what if i get those delusions what if im being watched and there goes that tiring cycle of overthinking ive also noticed that most of them report of audio hallucination and i just legit manifested it i thought i heard my mom calling me from the living room oh my god i went on to do online diagnostic quizzes dont even get me started on my search history i get anxiety just by typing the words schizophrenia or prodromal my hairs been losing a lot more lately i cant even cry hard because im afraid itll trigger a panic attack then a psychotic break ive also been trying to contradict some symptoms for example i try to be expressive on my facial expressions as i read those diagnosed struggle with it ive been tidying my space a lot lately as most schz patients often oversee them i also been meticulous with my hygiene i try to stay positive and go out of the house go to the gym as diagnosed ppl often struggle with them i continued doing some academic works since im on break to see if i still have the same mental capacity for the record im an active student in our uni org a deans lister and serves in my church im in my final year of uni and the leader of my thesis group to be honest im scared were poor we can barely afford treatment i dont want this life im only 20 the prime years of my life ive so much dreams i want to have a job move to an apartment in the city hike mountains ride a roller coaster see my nieces and nephew grow up surprise my parents with a trip to italy watch my friends succeed see the world ive only just experienced falling in love and to love i hope to grow old to love and be loved and as i ponder on my current state this is not the life that i want to lead i dont to be my minds own prisoner im scared and tired,post-pandemic

i lived in a very underdeveloped asian country where adhd is extremely difficult to get diagnosed a lot of doctors dont treat adhd some of who do think theres only hyperactive adhd adult adhd is not a thing girls dont have adhd impossible to have adhd if you were a good student etc etc you know how it goes from frustration of struggling to function daily i have been researching a lot since i was young starting with anxiety and depression i have started learning about adhd because antidepressants arent working and doctors arent helping me anymore recently moved to a better country with better healthcare have an appointment next week it costs a lot so i have been doing even more research as i dont wanna waste money if im not that sure about having adhd moving to a new country is already very expensive but found a comment as below you can not self diagnose adhd and researching the topic too extensively before a legitimate evaluation could impact your evaluation either by causing you to over emphasize things that are not actually much of an issue for you or by seeming to show drug seeking behavior by mistakenly quoting webmd or other articles on adhd now i am worried any suggestions to not mess up my evaluation next week i really dont want this to be a waste of money please help it is like i wouldnt have decided to get evaluation if i never researched this much but researching is also bad im really exhausted,post-pandemic
throwaway obviously i just need to get this out there because for the past several years my brain has felt like its tearing itself apart read this or not just posting it gives me relief i first became suicidal 5 years ago i had a plan and method and everything didnt go through with it came close a couple times after that but never outright attempted but soon afterward i started getting these messages like subtle and obvious hints that i actually was supposed to die on 26 june 2019 and my continued existence is an aberration negatively impacting everything and everyone these messages are in movies i watch books i read news social media hell sometimes in the way people talk to me it was my sacred mission to die and i was too cowardly to take it and i still am im fucking terrified of dying now but i know i need to ive been getting these messages for almost half a decade so many things are my fault the guilt is maddening,post-pandemic
i dont know how to start this but does anyone get extremely angry when your partner says another femalemale is attractive even when its a character from a show i cant stop the jealousy and rage that builds inside me whenever my boyfriend compliments or says another female character is hot basically we were watching arcane on the couch together and whenever the character jinx came on screen he was like god i just love jinx and i immediately became pissed i kept trying to tell myself that it was a character and not real but he kept saying things like i just love her braids and the things id do etc my entire mood changed in a second and i didnt even want to watch the show anymore and didnt even want to look at him i wanted to leave and scream at him i was so fucking pissed i had to sit there and just listen to him lust over some fucking shitty ass character i dont even care if he was joking it made me so fucking mad too because he begged me for months to watch it with him because he loved this show and now i just know its because he likes watching this character and finding her attractive the same things happened with the actress madelyn cline she looks exactly like his ex and it angers me so fucking bad whenever he likes her instagram posts or reposts a video on tik tok of her from outerbanks its rare he does but still why the fuck do you want to look at her so bad am i just not enough why are you even with me then i look nothing like that god fuck i just want to let my anger go on him it eats me alive so fucking bad,post-pandemic

i have a condition called intractable migraine basically ive had a migraine 247 since august 25 2015 almost 9 years my neurologist told me that at this point the migraine isnt going to go away not unless a new treatment is invented which cures me i do have a medication that helps control my symptoms so i can work and live a reasonably active life but im still in significant pain every moment and sometimes the pain builds until its unbearable if i went for a run right now id be in indescribable agony for about 3 days afterwards yesterday my wife got excited while talking to her sister on the phone and shouted with joy the loud noise was so painful that i was incapacitated for hours until my medicine kicked in i have ptsd from the first few years of my migraine when no medicine helped its hard to remember that time of my life but when i can access the memories all they are is unspeakable pain the only way i made it through was by believing id get better one day but im not going to get better this is my life now i will never know another moment without pain and i will never be able to do the things i used to love i was a mountaineer and an accomplished martial artist the man i was is dead and i honestly dont know how to accept that i want to accept it but i dont know how i dont really know what im hoping to hear in response to this post maybe someone here knows how to mourn the death of your former self maybe i just need to type it out i should probably be talking to my wife about this but i dont want to upset her i know shed tell me that doesnt matter that she wants to be there for me fuck i wish i could have given her ra better man than me a man who isnt held down by so much pain and trauma i wish i didnt hate myself for being such a ruin i wish i could see myself how she sees me,post-pandemic

hi everyone this will be a long post but i think it will also be a helpful one for those of you who are struggling to cope or have not yet had access to cbt i am not a therapist nor am i attempting to counsel however i have learned some strategies in therapy that are slowly helping me and i thought for those who have not heard these perhaps they could be of use id like to start by saying that i do not subscribe to this sub i did for a while and i found that it actually fed my health anxiety constantly seeing posts by people who were seeking reassurance would always put a new and frightening illness on my radar so now i occasionally check back when i am in a deep state of anxiety the key difference however between checking then and checking now is what im looking for when i used to look at the sub it was because i too was seeking reassurance i wanted to know what others were struggling with if my symptoms matched up with other peoples symptoms and if i discovered a new ailment along the way well then great i could add another to the long list of things that would kill be before i turned 25 next april when i look at this sub now however i dont look to the posts i look to the comments i am not seeking reassurance but rather evidence in cbt my therapist has been working with me on the importance of building evidence both for and against the disease i am concerned about at that moment i give you an example a snapshot of me right now age 24 gender male medical history nothing significant family history bowel cancer and melanoma however these are not relevant to my current state of anxiety current symptoms aching pain in my left leg for the last 6 weeks am now getting pain in both legs on alternating days muscle twitches fasciculations in both legs primarily above the knee but all over and in other areas of my body slight weakness in my sore legs and my left arm testingtreatment i have had done regarding these symptoms lumbar mri clear with minor wear and tear xray left leg awaiting results regular physiotherapy visits treating for referred pain from back what im afraid of alsmndms bone cancer for a couple of weeks i was a mess i was having panic attacks that i had alsmnd my muscle twitches were going haywire i couldnt sleep i was getting tingles down my leg and left arm then i started to actually pay attention to my therapist and some helpful commentors on this sub below is what my evidence for and against all of these things looks like evidence that i do have als i have muscle twitches which is a symptom of als muscular pain is sometimes a symptom of als i feel some minor weakness but nothing that stops me walking or grasping things in my sore legs and arm evidence that i do not have als i am 24 years old most cases of this disease occur in people over 40 and often closer to 60 i have no family history while most cases of als occur in people with no family history almost all cases in people below 30 or 40 are familial related muscle twitches while there are exceptions as with anything are usually a later stage symptom of the disease there is very little medical study into muscle twitches because they are considered to be of little medical significance in other words they are so common and have hundreds of causes plus hundreds more that doctors likely do not know about all of which are far more likely than als this symptom alone means little to nothing a quote i saw online but cannot remember where said remember muscle twitches are common als is not the prevalence of als is about 1 or 2 in 100 000 thats only between 10 and 20 in every 1 000 000 or between 100 and 200 in every 20 000 000 people those numbers are pretty good generally before other symptoms people will experience clinical weakness in their limbs ie unable to walk properly unable to hold a mug not just tripping minor losses in dexterity or even minor foot draggingtripping i have been clumsy my entire life its a running joke between my girlfriend and i about how clumsy i am the weakness and soreness in my left arm is probably from a tendinitis injury i have struggled with on and off for the last 5 years evidence that i do have bone cancer my legs hurt evidence that i do not have bone cancer i had a lumbar mri come back clean meaning nothing in lymphatic system nothing in my spinal column no tumours causing referred pain no family history i have had an xray and while i do not yet have the results if they come back negative thats about as conclusive as you can get conclusion all we need to do is look at the evidence i probably dont have als or bone cancer its far more likely that i have some mechanical fault in my legs or a muscular issue that will probably resolve with some physiotherapy true there are no absolutes in life true i could have one of these horrible diseases nobody on planet earth can guarantee i or anybody else doesnt but the statistical likelihood of me having these ailments is so minuscule that it isnt even worth worrying about and i know telling a person with health anxiety not to worry about health is like telling a dog not to smell another dogs butt and id be lying if i said this was a cure for my anxiety it isnt i still have low days and i still have weak moments but what this has helped with is coping on a daytoday basis i wont tell you not to google because i know that wont stop you but i will say a limit the amount you do and b if you do google dont just search symptoms and match yours to whatever horrible thing comes up instead look for evidence look for statistics in your age bracket look for ties to family history and hereditary links and most of all remind yourself that its okay to get anxious but it isnt okay to let that anxiety rule over you and ruin your day week month or existence i hope this was helpful for those who had time to read it,pre-pandemic

oh hi sorry for my bad english i guess im not a native english speaker tldr difficulty in school and having regional exam and fear of repeating this year class so yeah im undiagnosed 17 yo male with adhd your first question is did you self diagnose yourself no i didnt i did my research asked some professionals and all of them agree that i have adhd or even depression but anyway im too tired about the dont diagnose yourself cuz 1 im in an arab family my parents wont take me to a psychiatrist because they dont want to tell their mutual that im mentally ill yeah i know 2 psychiatrists here in morocco actually very expensive and very far away from me and kinda in many times a very waste of time i did try to have 2 one was only because i had some family issues and it was very cheap like 2050 per visit and they never mentioned any issues and tbh i was lying to him so yeah and the second one was only to have easy exams the canadian system or multiplie choices ones and yeah we dont have that in morocco by default 3 its so expensive to make papers to have the easy exams u need at latest 500 and pleasing the teachers in school and principal and even the doctors to make it fast and approve it at latest so yeah so what did my parents do after pleasing them is sign up on a study center that i didnt understand anything except french yeah we study french thats kinda cute and horrible all i want is advice or opinion how to help myself i have only 43 months before that i have terrible grades and we had 5 months without school cuz the governement adds some shitty system to the teachers i hardly high school fr i always get 10 11 to pass the year any recommendation and opinion is well deserved and thank yall for understanding my situation x200b,post-pandemic

although on paper i seem to be doing well i told him that i was still having a lot of trouble providing for my basic requirements im a leader for a student programme right now so you arent going to fool me into giving you adderall he says pointing up your honours college name tag all you have to do is drink coffee he says when i mentioned to him that i had gained about 30 pounds since beginning the medications he had prescribed he advised me to choose the finest weight loss plan start following it right away and then sign up for a planet fitness membership advised me to exercise for an hour every day and provided me with workout suggestions emphasising the need for me to continue losing weight while he was in the room with me he answered the phone and made an appointment for something like an eightminute ac repair and offered me more benzos which i find hilarious considering that i never requested them or showed any interest in them instead he treats me as though im attempting to con him into giving me prescribed medication after that he started making fun of me for asking for adhd treatment in front of the nurses in the main room im simply so angry,post-pandemic

skinny was and still is clearly the hype for years however curvier women are being more appreciated now which dont get me wrong is great but in a way its not different at all people say they like thick women but what they really mean is tiny waist and skinny everything except for boobs and butt this body ideal is even harder to achieve in my opinion because you cant get it through just dieting its arguable that no amount of exercise can help you get it either its mostly just good genetics then with an actual thick girl shell be called fat and be told to lose weight its ridiculous and a skinny girl will be called flat and told to eat a burger its exhausting that body standards dont cater to majority of the population and most likely never will,pre-pandemic
this doesnt have much to do with adhd but i have adhd and medical science and just science about bodymedicationdisease processes and mechanisms has been something ive hyperfixated on for a long time ive always dreamed about being able to go to med school classes on my own time just to learn i really dont care about the degree in any way and if i had one i wouldnt do anything with it i learn things as i question things but have no base knowledge to understand a good chunk and it really irritates me i live in the us or else id just go to college classes i assume i could probably find textbooks for free online somewhere but is there anyway to find lesson plans or something that would show the specific timelines of what would be learnedtaught throughout med school i know this is super weird but i just have this terrible itch to learn about it that i just cant scratch,post-pandemic
you do not want this disease it contorts the way you think turns you against yourself makes you question literally everything around you and is mentally exhausting to keep up with it can severely impact our lives and often requires a lot of treatment and strong medication saying that you may be schizophrenic because youre random or because you do impulsive things is stupid i recognize that some people do have schizophrenia and talk about it lightheartedly but self diagnosing yourself and making jokes about it for attention is infuriating,pre-pandemic
i strongly believe my son has adhd i see a lot of me in him especially the issues ive had when i was a kid recently his school behavior has been increasingly disruptive ive tried to get him evaluated and the doctors have said the same thing hes extremely smart but we cant evaluate him because we need school history and he needs to be older hes turning 4 and his behavior has now gone from screaming to throwing objects and fighting recently he threw a chair cause he didnt get milk and he scratched a teacher because he didnt get a cup cake his old therapistaba told me that this behavior is common for boys with adhd im stuck because i know what it is the evaluation people see it but wont diagnose him i want to get him the help he needs so he can manage any advice,post-pandemic
i have felt many times that i rely on my partner for things that i shouldnt have to such as reminding me to take my meds coming to get me if im having a panic attack in a store calming my panic attacks bringing me ice packs etc etc my therapist and i have briefly talked about getting a service animal and it seems like a really daunting task in canada the waitlist for a dog professionally trained is usually about 2 years long if i want help sooner i could adopt a dog and train it myself going to intensive behaviour training doing an online anxiety training program and continuous training done on my own i could possibly get the funding to do this through a grant with my school however i would have to decide soon what are your thoughts on this do you have a service dog have you ever thought of having one,post-pandemic
its just that i struggle to do anything about my problems and my medication nullifies it almost completely so what is everyones problem with me wanting to take medication ive been on this planet for over thirty years and i can confidently tell you that i have never been able to do the things i need to do to my own self detriment ive lost teeth jobs relationships future years off my life cars homes developed permanent health issues you name it adhd isnt cute or funny it fucking sucks in a year of taking medication i have doubled my salary from a promotion and become highly recognized at work bolstered my relationships stronger than they have ever been taken better care of my teeth and managed to keep up on things on my day to day ive started eating healthy all the time began working out and exercising routinely lost a hundred pounds that i put on during the pandemic lowered my blood pressure to where i no longer need it and then some please tell me again but louder what is the problem with medication,post-pandemic
i have had anxiety for my whole life and bad health anxiety for three years i have had therapy a number of times and it always feels like the only advice they can give me is various distraction techniques either grounding type exercises or doing things i love so i dont think about ha so much this feels inadequate to me as a way to tackle severe health anxiety can anyone weigh in,post-pandemic
i have been in a downward spiral since the pandemic i have not held a job for more than 6 months these are high paying jobs considering my status but it feels like i am trapped i cannot quit because i have a family to support everyday i wish i can restart my life i am happy and unhappy at the same time i dont think my wife can help me i have asked for my wifes help all i got is i dont know how i can help i can see in her eyes that she does and she feels helpless i have been trying to hold on for a very long time i have been thinking of how to die of naturalaccidental causes just to not have my family that guilt i dont want to traumatize my kids by committing suicide i just want to be free,post-pandemic
whatever mental state im currently experiencing i expect to last from here on and forever and i very obviously ignore the evidential fact that my moods and mental states have and continue to be very diverse my mind thinks that the current way i feel is the way ill feel forever from now on no matter what it makes me feel like i have no ability to even consider changing my mood in this present moment in the slightest because now its my permanent reality for better or worse despite the truth very obviously being the opposite i cant imagine feeling differently in the future from how i feel right now this obviously makes it very difficult for me to convince myself to take positive steps towards bettering my emotional state,pre-pandemic
after 15 years of suffering at the hands of addiction injecting any drug i could get my hands on drinking myself to death dying 5 separate times and being resuscitated losing everything and everyone hurting the ones i loved living as as someone i didnt even recognize by the end and being disgusted at what i saw in the mirror experiencing sexual assault more than once attempting suicide and facing dozens of relapses today i am 9 months clean and sober the longest ive ever stayed clean today i am no longer homeless i have family and friends i earned a human services diploma and now working on a psychology degree i love myself ive forgiven myself im grateful im sober im alive today i woke up and didnt need drugs or booze today i am forever grateful that i have found recovery and have freed myself from the grip of addiction onedayatatime recoveryispossible,pre-pandemic
who else had to unlearn normalizing and being flattered by men creepily leering and sexualizing you i thought the way men showed they liked me was when they leered and sexualized me i was groomed due to child sexual abuse and our sexist society i thought this behavior was normal i was flattered turned on traumatic bonding and brain changes and was attracted to creeps it didnt feel like love or like a guy liked me enough if they didnt sexualize me now as i have been processing my past trauma i realize how much i hate and fear being sexualized i dont want to be sexualized at all and get grossed out when men do i dont want to do anything sexual or even date for that matter i now see how wrong it is for men to minimize me to a sexual body i was so offended recently when i went to an educational discussion and at the end of the meeting the men were leering at my body how horrible that sex was the only thing that was on their mind instead of my intellect and what i could bring to help them so this is progress for me to realize how wrong sexism is because in the past i never saw myself as a feminist i still struggle with my body being turned on by creepiness because it was what was normal for so long i am actually afraid of my sexuality right now and feel shame and disgust about it especially when i become turned on by violating sex however im also noticing when i watch movies or see pictures of women getting sexualized i get grossed out and triggered more than i ever have i am now allowing myself to get grossed out by the creepers and being mean to them when i wasnt able to for most of my life i still have a part of me that gets turned on by creepiness and sexualization but i can confidently say it is starting to fade away especially as i continue processing my trauma and become more of a feminist i was brainwashed by society and the abusers in my life it is so bizarre to now see the truth and how what i was told was a lie about the sexualization and abuse of women to be normal and flattering i know with time and therapy i will be able to retrain my brain to be turned on by healthy sex with consent and boundaries completely i am already noticing that i am being drawn to these types of healthy relationships which i am very proud of myself for who else relate,pre-pandemic

day before yesterday me and my gf went out drinking with a my gfs friends me and my gf came back to her place and we had sex and slept her friends said they might come to her place later in the night from a different party which they eventually did they met this old fling of one of my gfs friend there and they invited him and his friend lets call him x along with them to my gfs place i was the one who opened the door for them woke up my gf and we sat together and played cards for a while it was getting late around 4am my gf said she feels sleepy and asked me to come to the bedroom with her and sleep i wanted to have a smoke before going to the bed that day and went to the balcony to have my smoke it would have been barely 5 mins and when i went back to the bedroom i saw my gf and this guy x were making out and were undressing each other i was so taken aback i really didnt know what to do or how to do anything i felt little disrespected furious low and sick to the stomach me and my gf are in a relationship for about 3 years now i have never done anything even so small that will hurt her just earlier that evening she was telling me that she was thinking about us getting married and the prospect of it i just left her house and went to mine at 4am and i couldnt even sleep she called me later in the morning and asked why i left i told her that you cheated on me openly and thats why she is saying that we were all so drunk that night and she wasnt in control of what was happening and that was the reason and she is sorry for it i cant take this as answer never i feel the lack of taking responsibility even more disrespectful of me i feel little and ashamed i feel like i should not exist just to stop feeling like this i have never even forced her to do anything if she didnt feel like doing it but she goes on cheating and brushes it off i had to attend a wedding today but i have skipped it and dont have any energy to do shit i am just lying on my bed since this incident i cant even say this to anyone since i feel ashamed and feel like a loser,post-pandemic

your are worthy and your life is worth being lived you deserve to feel safe you deserve to have fulfilling experiences beyond mere survival ptsd doesnt reflect who you really are nor do any other diagnostics from someone who went from being a straighta student and a communityinvolved artist to being the one who hands in everything late gets panic attacks when they make coffee at work and eventually cant go out of the house anymore i struggle to tell myself the things i wrote above but i can tell it to you with my full heart just because i respect you as any human being should be respected it feels like im losing everything that made my pride my diligence my productivity my ability to help my community and fulfill my role at work therapy doesnt help i feel judged they tell me thar im not conscientious and that im impulsive but i was never like that before and i know i still aint deep down no matter how i feel about myself i know how i feel about you stranger who has the same shit thing as me parasiting their head and you deserve the best in life,post-pandemic
hello all i just started lamictal again at 25mg per day after being off it for months at the recommendation of my psychiatrist she took me off it because i was having rage issues on it but off it i was a complete mess having panic attacks and breakdowns and there are no other medications she recommended she suggested i might have bipolar 2 im not sure if that counts as an official diagnosis but it seems fitting anyway ive been wondering how am i supposed to feel day to day when i was on abilify i felt numb with my emotions tamped down unable to cry ever and in retrospect it seems i was lobotomized and sedated when i was not on any meds i was somewhat catatonic but also agitated and online about 16 hours a day when i first went to my current psychiatrist last july she put me on latuda which allowed me to be productive but at the same time i felt maybe hypomanic my thoughts were always racing and i wanted to talk or text people 247 it also made my feet swell up like crazy so i had to go off it so i switched to lamictal my psychiatrist only titrated up to 50 mg over the course of four months i would notice it having a positive effect the first two days or so i started it or the first day of a new dose but after that it didnt seem to have any noticeable effect i was raging at people and having a great deal of anxiety so she decided to switch me to just buspirone for anxiety with gabapentin which makes me literally high and makes me stay up all night and hydroxyzine in case i have a panic attack which i dont think actually works for that purpose when i was just taking buspirone these past few months for anxiety i had insane anxiety a depressive episode and sleep problems and other symptoms that seemed like possible hypomania i had a weeks long depressive episode in january where i stopped going to work followed by what felt like agitated depression where i was unable to sleep through the night then i would be exhausted and one time i fell asleep in a study room at my school and had to go home and miss my 630 pm class so im just wonderinghow am i supposed to feel am i raging and spiraling because im not suited to lamictal or am i just not depressed anymore and realizing there are a lot of things i dont like about my life that ive put up with for a long time that i want to change how do normal people feel how does a properly medicated bipolar 2 person feel i am also on ozempic im not sure what psychotropic effects that has if any but it changes how your body absorbs meds plus i cant do any comfort eating while on it or eat a lot to manage my insomnia so being on it has definitely made me an anxious mess but i dont blame the medication itself the other thing im wondering is is it always obvious when youre hallucinating i have depersonalizationderealization issues and i live in one of the biggest cities in the us so i see weird shit every day and nothing really feels real last spring i was having this feeling like bugs were crawling all over my body and i went to a neurologist for a peripheral nerve test which they said was normal then that randomly stopped happening last fall but when i lie in bed at night i feel like the bed is shaking this has happened at two different apartments with two different beds and even happened when i first moved to my current apartment and was sleeping on a mattress on the floor at my old apartment it would feel like my roommates cat jumped on the bed but then i would look and he wasnt even in the room ive looked up possible causes for this and one of them is vertigo which im getting tested for next week but im just wondering if these are hallucinations how do i figure that out also are there other things that go into psychosis like one time a few years ago before i ever went on any bipolar meds and was unmedicated i had an episode and didnt leave my apartment for about two weeks but i couldnt sense time passing and two weeks felt like two days i was shocked when i saw what day it was also at that time i felt like i was above my body and went back into my body where i previously wasnt for like a decade if that makes sense so im wondering if this sort of time compression or feeling outside your body is a feature of psychosis or like having rage and feeling like you blacked out but you are sober the whole time im looking for insight because i havent felt happy or like a real person in years maybe ever and i would like to i would like to have a good life i would like to be able to think and pursue my interests without constantly spiraling the emotion i mainly feel is rage at any moment im either silently boiling over with suppressed rage or crying i dont let myself feel sadness i dont think because im afraid if i do that it will be endless and im afraid of what will happen but i dont want to feel numb either,post-pandemic

i know everyone here is trying to find answers to cope and overcome their health anxiety and as someone who has fully recovered ive noticed besides many dont really know how recovery looks like if you understand how recovery looks like i believe you wont fall into anxiety cure gimmicks because people dont really talk about how recovery looks like even when you are making progress its easy to selfsabotage and get discouraged during the recovery journey i wanted to give some steps on how recovery looks like i recovered without any meds or supplements btw i focused on acceptance exposure and patience i talk more about recovery below everyone is different and everyone is struggling with different aspects of anxiety derealization physical symptoms panic attacks obsessive what if thinking but much of the core recovery are still the same across the board i found my recovery and those ive helped follow this pattern the recovery journey goes something like this x200b 1 if you struggle with panic attacks this is the first thing to go away much of this is because you lose the fear of panic attacks much of the fear is what keeps panic attacks alive for longer and more frequent once you lose the fear it disappears pretty quick 2 anxiety still remains high so you will still feel feelings of derealization depersonalization physical symptoms what if thoughts but the intensity decreases this is quite stubborn as your nerves are sensitized and your nerves wont calm down so easily there are survival advantages to this as anxiety decreases the what if thinking also decreases physical symptoms lose intensity but are still present 3 you begin feeling glimpses of some freedom from anxiety in this step your fear now shifts from anxiety to what if the anxiety comes back as you start getting better the glimpses of freedom get longer and longer 4 getting hit with setback there will be multiple triggers during recovery that will convince you that you havent made any progress you have keep moving forward as you continue you journey setbacks become less frequent and less intense 5 anxiety eventually disappears but you dont know when it left you because after a while you stop caringyou are too focused on living eventually physical symptoms derealization and everything disappear last at least for me and many of the people i help physical symptoms and derealizationdp lose intensity throughout the progress of recovery so your confidence has grown during the entire duration of recovery ive created a video to really dive deep into the steps of recovery in the link below i also talk about what i did to recover in way more depth in the link below i hope this inspires some hope and minimizes much of the confusion around recovery best of luck to you all,pre-pandemic

hi everyone i wonder if anything can be done about disorganization moreso disorganized behavior rather than thoughts but thoughts too i struggle with basic routines for some reason i find it very difficult to plan and execute tasks my goaloriented behavior is nearly nonexistent if you have something similar happening to you how do you manage it i take cariprazine but it helps only marginally if at all now i know that there are nonpharmacological interventions such as therapy social support etc but im especially interested in medication thats able to attenuate disorganized symptoms and help me structure my life somewhat normally thanks in advance,post-pandemic

hey guys my main anxiety symptom is feeling faint each time i go outside i can only walk for two minutes and then i would feel faint to the point that i have to run home its really difficult because im skipping so many college days and my psychiatrist seems to not care enough to give me real solutions she gave me xanax for so many years but it does nothing to me i would take 6 pills and feel nothing i keep bringing up this symptom my cardiologist says that part of it is my really low pressure so im taking care of it but its mostly anxiety that needs to be cured sometimes i try to push myself but when i blackout i either freeze or run home i know that fainting isnt dangerous i tried so much exposure therapy and speech therapy but i keep on failing,post-pandemic

dae have ppl you dont like overtly hate for any reason but something about them just kinda irritates you like im an enby and lgbt as fuck but the like bisexualonly dates men girls who go on vacations like evey month and have septum piercings and buy only the most expensive and trendy vintage clothes they infuriate me and im sure its partially unconscious jealousy but also just this overall aura of fakeness i get from them feeling like theyre the main character anyways i just found two of my classmates like that on instagram and they both have pictures of them together on vacation with their bikinis and it makes me want to straight up explode from how flat their stomachs are and defined their waists are and how perky their boobs are like omfg mine look like deflated balloons like i literally have been at this for over a year and lost every ounce of substance in my body especially my boobs literally went from almost a d to barely a b cup and my fupa is still out and i have zero waist definition like i just feel so frustrated i know eds run rampant and i would never want to act like its not possible they struggle with an ed but it more just seems like theyre privileged with a beautiful body and a lot of money its so hard coming to terms with the fact that even when you lost all the weight you just dont have that body type to begin with and you will never look like that even once you have put in the work i stg im even more self conscious at a lower weight than i ever was at my highest i need to break this cycle,post-pandemic
i want to start taking trips out of the country and travel and be a tourist i usually would be super confident traveling alone i have done many solo road trips by myself but the thought that traveling internationally or in general would be problematic for me if i have an episode i can imagine getting excited and traveling 12 hours on a plane could probably trigger an episode i would hate to have reckless choice making while in another country especially one that doesnt speak the language i dont want it to stop me but what are some of your experiences,post-pandemic

my partner 28m and i 28f have been dating for three years i am concerned about his recent drug use and want advice on telltale signs of drug use spinning out of control into a drug addiction before its too late many years ago he was in rehab for a year because he abused several drugs including xanax while he was very young and was generally a troublemaker he got sober and back on the right path and stuck to smoking weed a couple months ago he started taking xanax for anxiety given his history and addictive personality which he has admitted to i immediately felt a pit in my stomach to know he started taking these when he first got the prescription he said he only needed it for a long flight on a trip we were taking but then he kept using it and told me if we got back home and he was still taking it then that was a red flag and that hed need help when we got back home from our trip though he told me he was exaggerating and that i should not reach out to his family ive never seen him have a panic attack but he feels very anxious before social situations and stressful work events i know he deals with anxiety so i believe him from my research however xanax is not a long term drug for anxiety i am not sure if the alternatives are any better either when he first got the prescription he abused it a little and was taking it recreationally while drinking he also took it before seeing my family during the holidays which pissed me off and made me anxious because he was acting very out of it when he was on it but lied to me about not taking it my parents could tell he was taking something that wasnt alcohol or weed and i finally had to tell them he started taking medication which sets off more slews of criticism and questions of concern because they are already wary of him he took it before we saw his family for the holidays too and i could tell something was off i could tell he took too much and even his mom asked him if he was high i nervously brushed it off and told her we were just feeling very jet lagged and tired from traveling so much he claims he is prescribed xanax to take it twice a day i know he has started seeing multiple doctors to try and get new prescriptions since it is difficult to get a xanax prescription and they eventually stop giving refills he also smokes weed daily around 8 times a day but it doesnt seem to help with his anxiety if he is taking xanax on top of it i cant tell what is addiction and what is genuinely medical treatment its tricky because its a medical prescription from a real doctor my dad abused alcohol and cocaine so i know from experience how easy it is to be gaslit and lied to and to fall down a vicious cycle with an addict i have reservations and feel like a bad partner for questioning his drug use i have suggested other methods of alleviating anxiety meditation yoga breathwork improving diet etc but he hasnt bothered to try any of this i am worried that if we have kids together he wont be able to handle the stress of being a father and also escape to drugs the way he escapes to drugs to escape stressful social and work situations he even took a xanax before we went to get drinks with friends because even hanging out in low key social settings makes him anxious anytime i try to address the subject he draws parallels between me and his mom who forced him to go to rehab and kept him there which shuts me up pretty quick because i dont want him to associate me and his mom together like that i know xanax can make rebound anxiety even worse and i am worried he is getting dragged down into a vicious circle i feel anxious about saying this to him because i dont want him to think i am questioning him and our future and i think he will just brush it off and tell me that its not too late to find someone else and that hurts because i am worried he is not willing to change or improve his lifestyle habits sorry for the long post and rant think i just needed to get this off my chest and look for advice on telltale signs of an addiction redeveloping and also how to help someone before it gets to a bad point,post-pandemic
im autistic so im very prone to the classic autistic meltdowns i feel like my condition stops me from being happy and normal instead im viewed as very weird and obsessive people in the past have scared me enough to barely talk verbally nowadays i know if i were normal id be happy and successful no one will accept that my condition has made me a failure yet i cant talk about it to anyone about this i just end up exploding and then overdose on my sleeping meds nowhere near enough to kill me but enough to knock me out pretty fucking hard i dunno im a mess tbh,pre-pandemic
ive always suffered from severe crippling social anxiety which has always made it very difficult for me to ask for help because the simple task of making a phone call to make an appointment is just something i cant do its now been a little over 2 months that ive been persuaded that i had adhd and i selfmedicated vyvanse using my friends prescription for a little over 3 weeks until i got a prescription of my own a few weeks ago i was worried i wasnt gonna be taken seriously by admitting using adhd medication prior to getting a diagnosis and it was really stressful for me to admit it because i was afraid they wouldnt take me for an appointment ive read a lot about the subject on the internet and many people recommended not telling your doctor about it because it would make you seem like you are seeking drugs but since i was really trying to find solutions and i really wasnt going there just for a prescription i told the clinic before the first appointment that i was currently using vyvanse and to my surprise they were really happy and told me that they see that everyday and that it wasnt a reason to not take me in charge on the contrary it would help the doctor decide which medication to prescribe in the case that a diagnosis was made since i received my diagnosis my mom has an appointment with the same doctor because i am 100 positive that i got it from her and my sister made an appointment with her own doctor for herself and her son because both have lots of symptoms as well and i feel like an hero of some sort if my godson whos only turning 6 this week have it and can be treated now and not only realize somethings wrong before his lifes already fucked up im an happy man in my case if i hadnt been selfmedicating my anxiety would have won me over and id still be where i was 2 months ago and being honest about it to my doctor has been the best thing ive done in the whole process if youve been wondering if you should tell or not your doctor about using adhd meds dont listen to the other people telling you otherwise and do it,pre-pandemic
ive been in weekly therapy for many months for my anxiety but i still havent managed to open up entirely for a while i thought ignoring it was fine but im 20 now and am interested in relationships eventually but until i can deal with my past i dont think dating is possible i need to relearn my own boundaries and comfort levels and be able to tell the difference for myself between giving consent because i want to be touched or because im afraid of what will happen if i refuse im also pretty sure i have vaginismus and there might be medical issues alongside the emotional ones but i havent even told my doctor that ive ever been sexually active because i figured shed ask for details and i wasnt ready to tell anyone i literally straightup lied though,post-pandemic

if you start getting depressed or lash out first thing theyll think of you is you are dangerous theyll look for a solution in mental institutions medicine restraining anything to keep you from doing harm theyll call you selfish for bringing hurt to them by trying to solve your own hurts to them you should suffer in silence and never exist the stories in the movies books etc are all wrong humans are selfish first and foremost jesus does not exist in real life and no he will not come to comfort you or understand you in your darkest moments nobody will thats why its just a myth to them youre just an animal a human turned into a zombie that needs to be taken out your emotions arent valid responses to your environment to them you are broken,pre-pandemic

i have diagnosed ptsd and have been not feeling any emotions for nine years besides fear sadness and anger during flashbacks and shortlived periods of happiness of less than one minute usually will one who is in this state ever feel normal again i also feel like i got less intelligent after trauma is this just a feeling or might it be true for i am still known to be intelligent,post-pandemic

hi my first post here ive probably read all the threads on here looking for answers and hints on how to know if im really bipolar or just faking it this is my story 6 or 7 years ago i was first diagnosed with mdd it was kind of an atypical depression i think as i was seeing and feeling things like being trapped in a bubble floating around kind of next to myself as if i was the observer i had an awful feeling that the time is about to end no idea what i needed the time for though i was really depressed with social anxiety several panic attacks was given escitalopram and some benzos for the worse days after that i felt okay i finished university got a job it was okay for the next couple of years id go to see the doc for somatic stress symptoms like headaches nausea stuff like that got citalopram and escitalopram 2022 i was feeling down again got escitil but i felt like it wasnt working anymore so i was given vorioxerine trintellix month later i went full hypomaniac and it was really awful i fucked up my life big time doc added absenor to calm me down when the post hypomania depression came he said to me that maybe im not depressed just dealing with the consequences of my actions this was very harsh but also very enlightening at that time i felt like maybe i was never depressed just sad and this was a huge change for me as i realised i can be sad or in crisis and it doesnt necessarily mean im depressed i was like wow never thought about this this way so in september 2023 i decided to go off meds i threw away every single ad i had the first 15 month was okay there was a lot of shit going on in my life but i felt for once like i could control it then november i couldnt sleep for 2 weeks or was waking up at 45 am normally i wake up at 8am go to sleep around 10pm i travelled to see my mom was very relaxed happy we would stay up until 3 am and talk which is not really the normal thing for us i told her about the hypo mania and all the shit ive done also i explained to her why i was never depressed i said was making that up and now i see it and feel it im cured little did i know december would feel like a fucking rollercoaster ride 34 days not being able to get out of bed very stressful things constantly happening in my life some related to the repercussions of the hypo mania not being able shower or eat just to wake up with a i should bake banana bread drink vine and dance to techno with my dogs and this would cycle every 34 days last week of december i finally crashed and was feeling really bad for the next 4 weeks i lost 18 lbs in 6 weeks i was feeling really anxious all the time my psych says im on the spectrum got quetiapine and im stable now my mind doesnt spiral and i can finally rest is it possible bipolar started just now im 29 or was it with me all the time i just didnt realize it because the symptoms werent as severe as they were on vortioxetins what do you guys think thank you for your insights your stories have helped me like no other,post-pandemic

growing up i was always a really weird kid i distinctly remember that i had just seen the world differently it seemed that my imagination had a bigger play in my life than most me and a friend in kind garden would squeeze batteries in our hands and pretend that we were mario or pokmon because neither of our families couldwould buy us a game console but we were exposed to them by relatives and tv it was so simple back then and looking back so pure but it felt like we were there we didnt have what other kids had to have fun so we became those things as far as i know i was a decent enough kid however when my brother came along around age 4 we would fight i would hurt him not bad typically young brother bs but still enough to get beaten from my father when he got off work my father more so was he is still with us a rigid traditionally hispanic in parenting angry regretful person when he was in the house there was always a strange energy of danger even if nothing was going on it was better to just stay quiet this didnt really work because my younger brother soon learned that it was an easy win when wed bicker to just cry out loud our dad would come in beat my ass and i would curse my brothers name for doing so but alas it would get me to stop my real last memory of child abuse before my teens is about 15 seconds of my dad putting me in a corner on the ground telling me if i wanted to fight to put my hands up and when i did to just shield myself he pummeled me with closed fists i was around 10 years old maybe give or take a couple years not sure i have terrible memory of most my life as i got older my brother and i actually started bonding he liked the way i started standing up to our dad no matter how bad i was beat down hes told me i inspired him my mom btw iswas awesome but didnt really do much except yell to stop from the sidelines or leave the room since she couldnt bear to watch i cant blame her not much negativity felt towards her for i know she unconditionally loves me and that mustve been a tough and traumatic experience for her as well moving forward im a decent student normally averaging around low as my brothers straight as if not 100s not much of a big deal there my mom started adding incentives once we grew into our early teens for every a we got in a semester shed give us like 10 dollars or something it was dope so we did well through out life i feel like i found connections that i would replace for my fathers love through friendship i grew very close and desperately wanted to fit in with my friends i would spend hours out of the house riding bikes around the neighborhood doing dumb lil kid shit but it was a really freeing time out i remember fast forward around when i was 14 my brother 11 my mom bought me a bass guitar because i had been getting into random enough japanese rock from the anime i would watch and to me the bassist was always the most bad ass and going crazy member my brother came along and she bought him a guitar spur of the moment figured it would help us bond it did it really did and i thank everything in this world for those times that followed because they were hands down the best years of my life i was a shitty bassist and soon transitioned over to wanting to be a singer and my brother excelled at guitar going onto be called a prodigy by everyone from teachers producers and most of the respected music industry people we would eventually encounter but at the time he was my little brother and being a fresh teen thought it would be wack to have my 11 year old brother in the band i started a couple bands the second one introducing my brother in as lead guitar this was a turning point back to family life my dad started to realize he was aging and i was starting to gain my testosterone fueled teenage body this didnt stop anything but only extended our fights into actual fights my dad a correction officer doing manual labor his whole life handed my ass to me every time all while telling me to kill myself and how no one loved me and i was a mistake nothing like this was said to my brother unless in terms of how ive manipulated him into becoming just like me i became a bit of a shitty protector of the house hold two accounts stick out immeasurably to me the first being funny kind of a call back to how my brother would yell for my dad to come my brother was upstairs and screamed tyler help dad just hit me in a blind fury i bum rushed my dad onto the floor commanded my brother to hold his arms down and pummeled him in his face chest balls anywhere i could hit before he brother free all while yelling the likes of it used to just be me thats where you shouldve left it it was a powerful moment my father spent the rest of the week walking downstairs like a caged tiger screaming and laughing about how he was going to kill me twas still a sweet victory no fear ill speed up the rest me and my bro made a band everyone betrayed us we made another and took full control of who was in it wrote all the music what we looked like who we recorded with and what not with his help i created a two year plan to get signed to a label called fearless records we played metal it was therapeutic and empowering stuff to play after everything youve read thus far we did it in four months i got a text by our newly acquired manager that we had been offered a deal by the label of our dreams i cried and got sent home early a record that i wrote all the lyrics to and my brother wrote all the music to all fueled by the hate and distinction of our father son dissonance it was the biggest victory a small town probably has seen at least our small town every time he said we were garbage we should try something else i couldnt sing and my brother should play something nice every time he laid a hand on us put into songs and we did it in four months still makes me proud to this day man btw this isnt a story about my father he is not the reason i want to kill myself anymore the label fucked us over made us record 3 different records each time hating something that they previously wanted and we called it quits our deal was good n no need to recoup anything just disband this is where whatever is inside me to this day was brought into this life a foe i dont know if i can beat this time throughout the story so far i had a flame inside of me the whole time a purpose to prove a will to fight i always told people that i wasnt sad i was angry and the anger forged who i was a determined skill ful musician with the mane of a lion and the attitude to match a man who did it but when that all went away i became a worm but not yet shit with my dad cooled off he retired im assuming his job really was the culprit of the aggression and i stopped holding the past against him at this point i had been a dumbass at points too and figured it was not worth the energy or the negativity of keeping that cloud around was he still an incredibly ill informed ego centric prick yeah but i was a different person now and couldnt be bothered with it most times shrugging off his comments i had worth now me and my bro made another band with just our drummer from the previously signed act but it didnt last long we did an all over the place ep that was uninspiring yet everyone we showed loved it drummer left became a solo artist hes a whole other story i cant help but feel as tho im responsible for his and my brothers mental state as im 34 years older than both of them i was always the dad figure to them fuck it tho rock n roll we did it once well do it again me and my brother move to los angeles california in hopes of creating a new sound within the fusion realm of rap emo metal and pop genres we moved with two of my friends from ny and got a shitty two bedroom apartment and split the rooms the other two room mates were supposedly friends for years yet fought constantly shit talked each other and created this crazy negative space in this 1000 sqft it was not comfortable to say the least however the one room mate in specific targeted my brother who at this point basically didnt talk to either of them this is point one and point 2 is my confesssion and then there was me i had developed an alcohol problem not that i drank every day or even every weekend but when i did i became a different person i would usuallly drink myself to sleep as well my brother picked me up from a bar one night and while on his way i began to get robbed i refused it and tried to buy time and ended up running to his car when he got there amped on on about 10 jack n cokes and the adrenaline of potentially dying i flipped shit on my brother cursing him out saying i didnt need him i could pay someone 20 dollars to do what he does etc it was awful and it was the last straw for him within the next week or so he packed up quit his job and went back home i was heartbroken but covered it up with anger my other two room mates if you can believe it convinced me that i didnt need him and that he held me back i thought id be okay and hed come back i left our room exactly how he left it for months he didnt this was the final nail in the coffin for my mental state to date i spend every night analyzing the past and i think ive learned that at first i created a whole identity to hating my father then after that i created a whole identity around me and my brothers music career and once he was gone and to this second of typing it im lost i dont know what to do my personality feels like its splitting some days im this really cool extroverted ladies man guy and some days im a worm in my bed spending money he doesnt have on post mates so he doesnt have to leave the apartment when i sit down and try to write music i can but i dont feel it anymore its the only skill i have i didnt go to a real college because of the deal im not good at anything and im not interested in anything other than music but theres no inspiration left in me nothing really makes me happy anymore i had a gf nothing broke up with her nothing i have a new one i miss her sometimes but for the most part nothing i have written 6 new songs nothing i post a photo on instagram nothing i go to work nothing i watch a movie nothing everything just seems so pointless now i dont see myself as the star i once did i dont even believe myself when i sing or have conversation with people its like im watching the most boring movie about someone that i just dont even care about i just want him to die i just want to stop wondering and working and fighting i dont want to do it anymore and i was the relief of death idk what i expect from this but it was slightly therapeutic thanks for listening,pre-pandemic

hey everyone so let me give you my background i am a 23f i previously dated a man from 1520 who severely sexually abused me we ended up staying neighbors from 2023 because i was stuck in this cycle of not wanting to give up my only support system he was my best friend aside from the abuse i had endured which he is very regretful and remorseful about truly but i made it clear i would never put myself back in that situation even though i know we have made massive improvements i have been going to therapy on and off since when i was 18 i finally got serious and was going to therapy for the last three years once a week until i lost my insurance i am working on getting good insurance and starting a new job soon so hopefully in two months i will be able to resume i work in the mental health field and have a mental health degree so i am very selfaware and have a pretty decent support system i have started looking at seriously dating again but am at a loss for how and when to disclose this information i was diagnosed with chronic depression and anxietyinduced depression at 18 i have taken meds for these and have changed my lifestyle to try and prevent falling into bouts of depression and becoming overly anxious i also have complex ptsd from the previous relationship which does affect me severely it used to be so bad that i would have night terrors and i tried to manage it with medication but there was not much they could do i tried several medications one worked really well at making me stop dreaming but then eventually stopped working and i could no longer go up anymore on it i have tried others that did not take away the nightmares but just made me sleep through them and be unable to wake up from them when they got really bad my psychiatrist and therapist told me that there wasnt much we could do besides wait for them to stop because they would stop eventually which they did for the most part the sleep deprivation from that 6 month period of being afraid to go to sleep led me to be diagnosed with bipolar disorder around age 20 i have tried several medications for bipolar disorder but all of them ended up making me extremely tired and i would sleep for 15 hours a day and be so exhausted i could not function i also worked fulltime and went to school fulltime at this time so i decided to stop trying medications because it was severely affecting my ability to function in daytoday life with that being said i still saw my psychiatrist once a month and went to therapy weekly i will say i have not worked on the ptsd portion as much as i should but this is also due to me having adhd and once i start bringing it up in therapy i cannot just turn it off and it brings back significant ptsd episodes on a daily basis and i cannot turn my brain off from replaying the abuse then that led to more sleep issues and then bipolar episodes so i have decided that i am just not at a point in my life where i can address it to the degree that i want without it affecting my daily life my ptsd used to be so bad that i could not sleep in a home with anyone else as it brought intense fear and reoccurring flashbacks this made dating difficult because most people would get offended if i said i could not spend the night and they would assume it was them even though i made it clear it was not i have always been extremely open about my mental health to anyone that i am interested in dating from the beginning i recognize that everyone has their own issues and their own traumas from family or friends with similar diagnoses and i respect that it is not something that everyone wants to deal with or can handle that is why i prefer to be upfront so they are aware of what it could be like to be with me because of my ptsd i do have a very hard time with physical affection unless it is someone i am extremely comfortable with i dont like hugs or being touched unexpectedly even if its just a hand on my shoulder i also dont like when people walk behind me because that still does induce unwanted thoughts and flashbacks to where i can be refeeling being abused all over again but the people around me would have no idea because i mask extremely well honestly telling everyone i am interested in my deepest darkest secrets is so mentally exhausting and it feels like i cannot keep going through these talking stages i am thinking about maybe holding off on that information unless it becomes an issue with the person i am seeing i want them to get to know me for me and not just make assumptions based on my diagnosis but i also dont want to blindsight them i am unsure of what the right answer is and i am looking for opinions i would like to disclose that i make it a point to not let my mental health affect those around me i am extremely selfaware of my emotions i am not an angry person even in my worst state i have never yelled broken anything or been mean to anyone sometimes i feel irrationally irritable and when i feel like that i let the people close to me that i am feeling that way and reassure them that it is not anything that they did but that i do not want to take any annoyance out on them so i choose to distance myself for the hours or day at most that i feel that way before reconnecting with them i just feel like there isnt going to be anyone who would love me and put up with my issues especially depression and anxiety sometimes i have to leave places because i am not in the right state of mind or just dont have it in me to go places some days now i will also say that i am a very loving partner i like to show my love through quality time words of affirmation and acts of service and sexual relations arent off the table at all i just want to be comfortable with someone first and know that they would never pressure me into anything i have met people who have been like that and go out of their way to make sure that they dont accidentally make me uncomfortable by touching me unexpectedly etc those just havent worked out im 23 so i know that most people arent looking for longterm relationships in this generation im sorry for the long rant i just wanted to get some opinions on what i should do x200b tldr i have always disclosed my mental health diagnosis right off the bat before meeting but to tell a stranger my deepest darkest secrets is extremely mentally exhausting especially when it doesnt go anywhere after a day of talking and i realize that theyre not what i am looking for or viceversa but i also understand that not everyone wants to deal with those with mental health issues which is why i disclose i am wondering when the right time to bring it up is without causing mental exhaustion and wanting for someone to also give me a chance and not assume how i am based on a written mental health diagnosis,post-pandemic
i drink every day dont get much sleep i feel absolutely crazy,post-pandemic
i feel like anytime i get attached to someone i become the most annoying and insufferable person ever to them this causes me to not text or bother them in any way for fear that im annoying them and they probably dont want to hear from me and if i text them they feel obligated to answer me and if they actually wanted to talk to me they would text me first i also think though that im annoying to everyone but i just dont care unless that person is important to me i usually end up talking to the important people less than people who arent as important to me just because the stress and anxiety that im annoying them scares me from even contacting them whereas with the less important ones its not a big deal if im annoying them because who cares if they dont want to talk to me anymore with an fp more is on the line if i start to annoy them idk just some ramblings from me because ive been feeling lately like a joke and a loser and someone who nobody wants to be around because im so fucking irritating and stupid it seems no amount of reassurance from anybody can change how i feel about that,pre-pandemic

hello i am trying to think of some sporting activities i can get my son in to he is aware that things like football soccer etc will likely result in him getting aggressivehurting others due to him being worked up and competitive he has his own version of swimming as has been against doing swimming lessons once he got to school age but i would like to try to get him to do them he has been copying his brothers freestyle swimming every now and then i am looking at surf club activities where they do games and swimming races as an option i feel it would be good to get him into a sport for his health but also so that he can develop positive relationships with other people in the community i have a strong feeling he will be against swimming and surf club but i know that he loves the beach and the pool for unstructured swimming and play i know that if he doesnt want to do it he is going to get stressed and upset but there is a good chance he could learn to enjoy it i am nd but not autistic but i would hate to put him through something that is hell for him i think tennis could be a good one as it isnt chasing after a ball in a team situation you stay in the rectangle and frustration is usually taken out on the racket i would love some advice andor viewpointsexperiences thank you edit my general gut feeling is to encourage and make available unstructured stuff that he will enjoy like playing with mefriends at the pool and beach exploring and more unstructured activities if its something that is going to create meltdowns or high stress to even begin it i normally avoid it but i dont know if that is actually the best thing to do there are historically things that he has been 100 against that he actually enjoys now,post-pandemic

hey ive been thinking about this and wanted to know if anyone has had a similar experience or what their thoughts are sorry this is a really long post its hard for me to process all of this x200b im female and 21 years old for years id been curious whether or not i have autism i fit a lot of the diagnostic criteria horrible sensory issues meltdowns rigid thinking severe social deficits causing anxiety difficulty interpreting social cues cannot make friends not reciprocating in conversation just generally not understanding what is appropriate vs inappropriate and coming off as rude to others repetitive movements poor eye contact i was also diagnosed with ocd and adhd in the past the ocd is probably something i struggle with the most and affects every aspect of my behavior emotions personality and decision making constant rumination and obsession over particular topics so many fears and phobias magical thinking replaying past experiences in head over and over strong desire to control tics performing the same task over and over otherwise x will happen etc just constant insanityinducing repetition in my brain a month ago i had a fullscale neuropsychological evaluation they tested my iq tested for various disorders and had me fill out some questionnaires it was about 6 hours long yesterday was the feedback session the psychologist diagnosed me with ptsd and adhd she explained that ptsd can mimic autism to the point where the two are nearindistinguishable even the sensory issues ive had for as long as i can remember could also be caused by trauma its kind of strange to me she also disagreed with my ocd diagnosis which was the most surprising part she explained how severe trauma can cause ocdlike symptoms as well is it not considered ocd if its caused by trauma i dont really know what to think i dont think my trauma is that severe ive had some hardship but im not sure i feel like i was just born ultra sensitive and that anything could be traumatizing to me it feels like a lot of my questions were answered but i still am left with more,post-pandemic

your brain is crazy powerful and can literally cause you to experience newmore symptoms it can also make you more aware of perfectly normal traits and twinges that youve always had but had never paid attention to until now your brain is powerful but it doesnt control you you do have the ability to take control back it takes a lot of practice and hard work but you arent doomed to forever be a victim to your anxiety even if you need some help in the form of medicine or therapy theres hope for you to feel calm again this has been my mantra lately and i wanted to share it with everyone in the hopes it could help someone else,pre-pandemic

ive been struggling with depression and suicidal thoughts for a while now its not been easy for the past couple of months ive always looked at suicide as an easy solution to my problems last friday when i got home from school i decided i wanted to make a suicide attempt id already been thinking about it for a while i looked through my fathers tools and i found a hammer i sat down in a chair and pointed the hammer at my head and i was swinging it around for a while trying to gather courage to hit myself it was probably like 5 minutes but it felt like an hour with that hammer in my hand my life was flashing before my eyes and i ended up putting the hammer down i just stared at the wall for a while and started appreciating life after that ive been feeling happier for the past couple of days i probably will end up relapsing but for now i feel like im genuinely healing and its the first time ive felt truly happy in a while,post-pandemic
a couple years ago i got a job delivering pizzas the first day started fairly well the first few customers were pleasant and tipped generously then later on in the day i had to deliver a pizza to an address where lots of gang and drug activity was prevalent as soon as i pulled up i was stressing out there were several sketchy people around i gave the customer the pizza and while i was waiting for him to pay me my hand just started shaking uncontrollably from how stressed i was i put that hand in my pocket to hide it and took the cash with the other of course they didnt tip i was flooded with stress for the next half hour in a way that i havent felt in a long time at the end of the shift i thanked my manager for the opportunity but it just wasnt for me i got a job now that doesnt put me in stressful situations,post-pandemic
ive been clean for almost two years now and heroin was my drug of choice but i did meth from time to time this morning in my way back from taking my daughter to the bus i found a sizable bag of meth on the ground i brought it inside and eventually flushed it but i really struggled with it i rarely have cravings anymore but i also havent had anything in my face like that anyways im still here and still clean just kinda stressed at the moment,pre-pandemic

i am addicted to meth and alcohol i have been clean from meth for three days but alcohol is a whole other story due to its dangerous physical withdrawal symptoms the problem i have is that no one will take me in for a short 3 day detox period just to get the worst of the physical issues out of the withdrawals doctors keep telling me that i need to get into a 30day program and refuse to prescribe detox meds which it ridiculous not everyone can go to inpatient rehab the outpatient program told me that as long as i can be detoxified from alcohol they will accept me how the hell can i detox on my own when no doctors will prescribe the damn benzodiazepines to get me through the withdrawal period i know benzos are addictive i get that but for fucks sake i keep trying to tell these damn doctors that benzos are the only drug that i do not even like i actually hate taking benzos because they make me feel like a zombie but i detoxed years ago and they were lifesavers for me it is incredibly frustrating to be delegitimized just because i am an addict and please do not tell me that i am in denial i am not in denial i work for a large corporation that has tons of politics involved and going on leave from work would result in me losing my job and please dont tell me there is job protection for these kinds of things yes on paper there is job protection in place but an employer can find ways to push you out the door if they want to i would go to inpatient rehab if it were a choice i do not have a family or support system that will help me through this in the event that i lost my job losing my job would mean being homeless so please dont tell me that it is better to lose my job than my life i was homeless years ago and the trauma i experienced completely fucked me up in the head i barely made it out of homelessness alive and highly doubt i can do it again i would rather be dead than homeless,post-pandemic

ive recently got through health anxiety and wanted to use my experience to help others ive waffled on a bit so if you dont want to read it all please just read the top 2 points as they are the key i can guarantee reading this is better time spent than googling symptoms know your enemy as you are on a health anxiety page youve likely had confusingly clear test results and already know your enemy isnt cancer ms hiv etc its anxiety dont underestimate your enemy feeling physical symptoms that cannot possibly be anxiety wrong the effects it can have on your body can be very physical very painful very scary and very real ill have to start my story partway through i was running up the stairs at work to get to my desk in time and slipped i fell awkwardly on the hand rail and heard and felt a rib crack work was a nightmare and had been for weeks id just become the manager of a new team and things were going wrong i carried on up the stairs in pain and a few days later went to hospital i had a chest xray and they confirmed a fractured rib work got worse and my cat became very ill and i really love my cat looking back all the signs were there months before this each time something stressful happened i got all hot felt sick and lost my appetite at the time i didnt think much of it then one morning everything changed a couple of days later i woke up with what felt like a burning hot hand squeezing my heart i couldnt breathe properly as i started to panic i ask my girlfriend to take me to the emergency department and i genuinely thought i was going to die i even kissed my cat goodbye thinking id never see her again i got seen straight away after an ecg and blood tests and a few hours of waiting my chest had settled but was incredibly tight i was asked if i had eaten anything yet as i got there at 6am i said no i was given toast and paracetamol and told there was nothing wrong with me and was shortly after sent home i think leaving without an answer was a real tipping point i took 3 weeks off work and in that time my body and mind spiralled downwards i kept catastrophizing what if i get fired from my job what if i cant work again and have to sell my house what if i am seriously ill and that one stuck meanwhile my body was malfunctioning all over the place my bowel habits changed for the worse my digestion was all wrong with reflux and heartburn i felt so weak and light headed then overnight i developed excruciating back pain that radiated up my neck i was sure now that the doctors had made a mistake and that my attack that day was something more this carried on at varying degrees for months deep down i kind of felt i cant be that ill as i went on holiday twice and felt a bit better when i was away but then at its worse i couldnt leave the house i even text my girlfriend when she was at work to say i had a flesh eating skin disease now known as a blister in my toe i fell into the trap of googling symptoms and trying to use the internet for reassurance id diagnose myself first with a stomach ulcer then gallbladder disease then pancreatic cancer new ones each week each time the doctor sent me for the tests which came back clear putting me back to square one believing it was me against the doctors who kept missing things one day after i had made 4 diagnoses in one day i felt enough was enough and contacted a councillor who fitted me in that day she took me to the beginning of the story i just wanted her to fix me and was puzzled why she was asking about recent bereavements earlier in the year i had been at a close relatives bed side when they died and my dad had a very risky operation that was 5050 if he would make it i thought i had dealt with that i got back into my car after the therapy session and was in tears obviously i hadnt she also made me think about what my triggers were my back ache had worn off a little in recent weeks a stressful conversation with my boss on the phone and it was back with a vengeance so the link in my brain was now correctly back ache due to anxiety rather than back ache due to randomly malfunctioning organ i also went to my gp who put me on sertraline which is a commonly used antidepressant for anxiety the side effects were difficult at first in fact 3 days in i was having panic attacks but after a week the side effects subsided after 4 weeks my physical symptoms virtually disappeared my health anxiety went with those pretty much i suppose humans are great at suppressing the knowledge that we are all going to die some day otherwise life wouldnt be much fun i think my experiences with death and illness of people close to me stopped me suppressing that and my stress and anxiety at the time made me relate it to myself so relating all of that together here is my advice cbt i have an app called quirk that really helps it gets you into the habit of challenging those irrational thoughts if apps arent your thing imagine you are in a courtroom being cross examined for your irrational thought being pressed for the actual evidence etc your brain carves out a path and the more you think the same the better and easier that path becomes for your brain challenge this path to start closing it off medication id never taken antidepressants before and never wanted to but the truth is they just calmed my whole body down after the side effects my physical symptoms reduced greatly which was a game changer not saying they are right for everyone speak to your doctor of course im definitely not a doctor therapy i was lucky enough to afford private therapy straight away i would recommend it to anyone they really get to the root cause she helped me break the cycle by getting me to relate my symptoms to anxiety triggers and not other illnesses lifestyle changes exercise helps but fitness isnt for everyone im a much more creative person so i forced myself to write some music and did things i enjoy whatever you do to enjoy yourself is better than sat worrying and googling symptoms work out your triggers if a certain situation results in a certain symptom this realisation can help immensely dont rule out anxiety just because one of your many symptoms isnt on a list we are all different do not google symptoms if doctor google was real he would have been struck off by now for getting everything wrong do not seek reassurance from statistics if it says 1 in a million people your age will get this illness you will still focus on the 1 do not seek confirmation of your self diagnosis from friends or family this will only reinforce the faulty path your brain keeps sending signals down tell them to shut you down if you talk about health keep busy and productive while taking care of yourself if a friend was going through a tough time youd but them a gift etc right do it for yourself above all if you have got this far you know its anxiety so take control and be proactive about fixing yourself hope this helps someone happy to talk to anyone going through this as it is horrible to go through you will be ok,pre-pandemic
hes out of my life this time for good a year ago i got my restraining order against him three months ago i told his friends to fuck off deleted the number of every friend who chose him over me transferred classes away today i deleted every single voicemail he left me erased all his contact info threw out all his clothes threw out every single gift he ever gave me started treatment on all the mental and physical scars that were supposed to be love after four years hes purged from my life its been a lot of tears shaking nail marks in my skin flashbacks guilt panic attacks lonely nights hopeless moments and ugly thoughts but i did it my emotions are jumbled and my head is a mess i have tears on my face and shirt but thats okay im here i survived i did it and now hes gone this time for good i wont let him hold me back,pre-pandemic
i started restricted eating for the first time when i was 15 but ive had body and food issues my entire life my eating disorder was at its worst and longest when i was 17 i went through phases of recovery and phases of relapse but hit one year relapse free in july of 2023 in september i relapsed it started slow but im now 20 and my eating disorder is the worst its ever been i remember early days of recovery from that first bad time and how horrendous it felt i couldnt shower with the lights on and i was so self conscious about my body when i had been so proud of my achievement before im terrified about ever doing that again ive been in a hell cycle for 5 years gaining and losing the same weight over and over again and its all so pointless but i just dont see what the point in trying to get better is i feel like i locked myself into something when i first learned restrictive eating when i was 15 and its not something ill ever not know i know how long i can go without eating before i just completely collapse and i know how many calories are in a slice of bread from like five different brands and even in recovery it calmed me when i was stressed to know my intake for the day genuinely is anyone on here actually better does it ever really go away,post-pandemic
i turn eighteen on thursday but i wish i was still a child but with all my current knowledge so i could advocate for myself and hopefully stop myself from experiencing some of the traumatic stuff i had to go through due to being undiagnosed i fantasise about it often it plagues my mind i know that logically there is nothing i can do for my younger self but i still feel like i need to do something even if i could just send a message to my younger self telling her itd all be okay or even if i could just send a message to my parents telling them to ignore the stigma around autism and just get me diagnosed anyway thats the actual reason they didnt get me assessed when i was younger but i dont blame them that much my uncle was autistic and had other medical issues and my mum witnessed him get horrendously bullied and mistreated so she was just worried for me,post-pandemic
ive been struggling with ha for so long i dont even remember what life was like beforehand im currently having a ha flareup i wont get into specifics as to why but im stuck in a vicious cycle that goes like this this symptom is bothering me what if its xxx i should see a doctor oh my god what if it actually is xxx i shouldnt go to the doctor because theyll just confirm it so if i dont go then its not real what if it is real and then by the time i do go its too late to do anything ill die and ill deserve it because i waited too long and i dont want to die so ill go to a doctor but what if it truly is xxx no i wont go im sure these symptoms are nothing anyway and thus the cycle repeats i am so exhausted i am paralyzed with fear it feels like my mind is out to get me sometimes i try to think rationally i try to think of what is the more likely explanation but if there is even the tiniest sliver of chance that i could have xxx my mind zeroes in on that and accepts that as the only possible reality so by the time im ready to see a doctor ive already accepted my fate theres just no way i dont have xxx im doomed everything i have worked so hard to build in my life will have been for nothing ill lose everything the other shoe will have finally dropped the worst part is when i do end up seeing a doctor i dont even trust the test results i dont know why im not in the medical field i dont have an education in medicine so why on earth would i know better than someone who spent over a decade on learning how to do this job and yet this fact doesnt stop the anxiety or the cycle its still with me all the time it follows me like my own shadow every single time i have been so convinced that i have whatever illness and every single time i have been wrong every time i wish i had just gone to the doctor sooner because then i couldve ended my suffering earlier but what would be the point because i know this cycle will just restart eventually with a new health concern does it get better will it ever go away is there some kind of toolkit that i dont know about that will help me feel less powerless to my own mind i dont know how to keep living like this,post-pandemic

after getting sent to voicemail for multiple days in a row and being overdue on my med refills i find out on the phone while trying to get my prescription refilled that they discharged me they cited missed appointments one of which was when i was in the psych ward last december and i had never even had a warning they claimed to have sent a warning letter but i never received it and didnt get the discharge letter until the morning after i find out over the phone that they dropped me theyre one of the worst rated offices in my town but they didnt have a waiting list when i was having a mental health emergency last year and i live in a cow college town in fucken alabama so all of the psych offices in my area are never taking in new patients the letter even said theyre available for emergencies for 30 days after the letter being sent which was on the 2nd of this month so i should still be good right but apparently refilling my meds doesnt count as an emergency i guess even though i need them to function idk i guess im just bitching but im feeling really discouraged its hard enough finding my meds in this shortage but now im cold turkey off 30mg twice a day dextroamphetamine having to navigate this shit im really upset and i already am in the middle of a mental health crisis,post-pandemic
just kinda got parents that arent all that great even though theyve given their best both are substance addicts weed and alcohol in particular ive tried to move on past it but for some reason everyone i talk to my age ends up laughing at me or awkwardly shying away i live in a conservative white town as a mexican for some reason just having long hair made me a target for random groping by kids and adults im tired of having everyone take pity on me while at the same time no one does im tired of having people call me trans or gay and whispering about me or calling me stupid names i dont feel like im living,post-pandemic
ive been having a rough string of luck finding a therapist that deals with hypochondria out of the practitioners ive met 1 first one asked me about my health and said the life expectancy in canada is around 80 so i have no reason to worry about dying asked me to subscribe to meditation podcasts 2 second one went straight to asking me to download their app for meditation podcasts and listening to them during the session the app collects every type of data from my phone 3 i paid 260h for one cbt specialist but i was their first patient coming to them specifically for hypochondria the exercises revolved around recognizing triggers for hypochondria and avoiding checking behavior but after 10 sessions i couldnt feel i was making good progress could have been my fault im not blaming them but they did tell me they have no other patients with my strain of anxiety tldr does anyone know any practitioners at any cost that have experience dealing with patients with hypochondria,post-pandemic

like many on here i have been utterly convinced that death was rapping on my door ready to whisk my into that gentle night and every time i go to answer its just another version of myself standing dumbly at the other side of the door wearing a hood and cloak i have had every symptom under the sun and yet despite what dr google tells me i am still in near perfect health what is the biggest and realest detriment to my health anxiety it plagues my mind and has me pissing every 5 minutes in the night thinking i have diabetes or kidney failure im actually just so dehydrated from fear that i gulp buckets of water every night hell just a moment ago i had somehow convinced myself that i have skin cancer because my hand was itchy why was it itchy because every damn time i take a piss from the waterfall i consume i wash and scrub my hands now i am no longer itchy because i chilled out some and used logic to slay that fear i have a fluttering on the left side of my body has to be some wicked mediaeval disease that wants to make me its playground right no its just the tummy rumbles that only ever appear when i am anxious wait do i have more moles than before yeah must be dying any day now just waiting for that cancer yknow just wake me up when it starts to get interesting ah but this persistent uncomfortable leg feeling is deep vein thrombosis but of course i sit too much so when will it shoot up and annihilate my brain probably fucking never actually i am very much alive very much in good health and besides a very overactive imagination and a love for horror i am just another normal human being who occasionally finds themself short of breath amongst millions of others doing normal human things what i have come to learn is that these symptoms arent ones of imminent death but rather ones of life feel your heart beating weirdly guess what your heart is beating it changing its pace or pattern is just what it does stop judging it so hard man is your arm numb well shit it might just be a normal human arm sorry for the prognosis in case you were hoping that you were another species if you feel anything at all it is a symptom of life if its uncomfortable then perhaps you shouldnt drink 3 cups of coffee tomorrow aye or maybe your bedtime was basically yesterday you dont need reassurance you need the sort of logic that experience gives you if youve survived 5 false signs already then the 6th one is very likely to be nothing but the boy who cried wolf was right eventually yeah but youre on wolf watch in the fuckin city and youre not just crying wolf but also lion and gator at the slightest flashes of yellow and green its just a traffic light go back to bed chill out you havent died since you began reading all of this have you maybe a few braincells but thats just the gilsworth charm so im here to remind you that you are okay youre good youre golden and even if you werent then the fact of the matter is that we live in an unprecedented time of medical wonder you are here because you know you worry not because you know you have cancer iz all gud capiche,pre-pandemic
i wanted to share a different approach that helped me a lot in previous years and when i was at the peak of my health anxiety my anxiety was always about my heart palpitations is it ok am i dying to the point where i would overanalyse everysinglething i felt every twitch every weird sensation every pain every little thing that my body did basically i went to counselling for it and there i learned a new way to look at it and i wanted to share it and maybe it will help someone else as well x200b imagine a machine that scans your body it could be like a light scanner inside of you that just scans your whole body all the time people with health anxiety people like me in stressful situations turn this scanner on usually because their life feels so overwhelming that they just need something to control and they feel like if they can at least control their own body and make sure its always at 100 things will get better thats how i felt at least now this scanner once its on it starts scanning all the time it scans from head to toe it scans while you eat while you drive while you walk and it scans in the back of your mind and then it happens x200b youre walking down the street and you get a palpitation you move your eyes too quickly and you feel dizzy for a moment your neck feels tight out of nowhere a sharp sudden pain comes and goes in a moment out of nowhere you name it something small something that passes in a second or two something that this scanner is looking for x200b and oh my god does it send an alarm of course it does the scanner is literally waiting for something even remotely out of the ordinary the tiniest of things to happen and it sends an alarm to the whole body suddenly youre in panic what was that palpitation am i dying why am i dizzy am i gonna faint etc the panic passes and so does the symptom that caused it and now youre absolutely afraid of getting the same symptom again because you connect it to panic and if youre like me you connect it to the thing you were doing when it happened in my case palpitations happened after ive eaten and it nearly created an eating disorder because i refused to eat anything more than a sandwich for months i was afraid of eating because my brain was connecting the panic with food i was afraid of food x200b so moving on panic is done youre calm but the scanner the scanner has done a good job in your brain the scanner has done a fantastic job at alarming you that something happened so it keeps going in the background of your mind looking waiting for something even remotely out of the ordinary to happen and sometimes if a whole day passes and this scanner is going on in the background youll feel tense af almost like youve waited a whole day for something bad to happen to you and that feeling alone can trigger symptoms so hey more work for that damn scanner x200b now every person has a scanner however in people with health anxiety that scanner is suuupeeer sensitive an ordinary persons scanner would send an alarm when theres something genuinely wrong with you something you need checked asap but it wont send alarms for the day to day little things like heart skipping a single bit small pain in your chest etc etc x200b so my way of dealing with it was once i realised that this was all that it was i had a hyper sensitive health anxiety scanner in me haha and its turned on most of the time because of my health anxiety so next time i get a weird sensation and my first thought is shit im dying i just follow it with nah girl thats the scanners alarm and just recognising it as what it is just a false alarm helps calm me down and not go into full panic mode over something small and remember if it truly is dangerous to you the alarm will not stop for hours sometimes days and it will be more like bring your attention to this symptom its been happening in a while it could mean something you should check it out and not oh my god this is it im dying this is the end my heart is failing i cant breathe learn to recognise the difference in your own body x200b so yeah thats it it helped me cope and i hope it helps you as well remember a hyper sensitive scanner will slowly turn into sensitive scanner and at the end youll be just like everyone around you with no health anxiety its just until then remember that youll be fine and your body can indeed send false alarms because youre fixated on your health so much it thinks its necessary to let you know about anything and everything thats happening inside of you your heart is just having a hiccup and like every other muscle in your body sometimes it twitches for no reason your head is just a bit dizzy but think of all the times that youve been so happy or so excited about something that you also felt dizzy and you were still completely fine you got this youll be okay keep going 3 edit thank you so much for the 2 gold im glad this post has helped people and calmed them down even a bit,pre-pandemic

youre trying to manage the same stuff everybody else is able to manage but marbles keep falling out of your hands and neurotypical people are giving advice like well why dont you just put them in your bag because i dont have a bag maybe youre struggling to carry only 50 marbles and you see people around you easily managing 150 which is bitterly discouraging but the fact that you can even hold on to that many is incredible because you dont have a bag but youre still trying medication is like having a bag with a hole in it its so much better than what youre used to so when you start using it you feel on top of the world then you notice that marbles are slowly falling out and you think whats the point its just as bad as before but you have to remember its still worth it the worst thing you can do is trip on the marbles youve dropped thats my biggest struggle i focus on one little thing ive messed up and all of a sudden ive come crashing down and drop all the marbles i was able to hold minutes before i dont really know where im going with this but as soon as i thought of the analogy i hyperfixated on it of course and had to share it hopefully this helps you in some way maybe as a way to explain adhd to people who dont get it edited to add not everyone wantsneeds meds and thats fine the bag with a hole can represent whatever coping mechanism fits you best eg therapy 2nd edit to those asking if they can steal this no you cant because im freely giving it to you do with it what you will no credit necessary,pre-pandemic
i dont have anyone to speak to up until 67th grade i had several friends within the same girl group but a different one would be my best friend throughout the years then i was nobodys favourite even the girl id talk to the most every single day suddenly preferred someone else over me in high school i struggled to make friends because nobody seemed to meet my standards very few people shared the same interests or didnt care to gossip about every single human in my relatively small city they just werent my type of people i could talk to them at school and they asked me out a few times which i accepted about twice ish but i couldnt force myself to see a deeper friendship there and the anxiety i felt about it made it seem not worth it i would skip events because at that point it felt like i had to know how to behave in those situations but i was so scared i didnt even want to try for people who i didnt like i skipped prom and within a few months i finally moved abroad to study for a bachelors i felt more comfortable but it was still a scary experience when i didnt have support outside of my mom i tried to talk to people but my first priority was focusing on the education my parents are paying for it became impossible to separate how people behaved towards our academic work and towards me i built a lot of resentment when people were not motivated to complete a task that affected my education and future i did not approach things the best way i could have but i found it ridiculous to see older people with lives way more sorted out than mine unable to do very simple things time and time again until id get angry needless to say nobody but two girls liked me enough to become sort of friends with me the first one was a sweetheart that accepted my criticism even if i delivered it bad while the second secretly snapchatted an online friend of mine that had feelings for me and i had feelings for as well even in a group with them and two other guys i was the only one excluded from the friendship group in other projects that i would call out people for their shit behavior i also ended up being the only one excluded as they would all make plans to go out right in front of me without me was i so stuck up that nobody wanted to give me a chance was i too uncomfortable that people didnt think i want to talk was i too mean when someone jeopardises my future i wish i knew what was wrong with me ive wanted to make friends especially since i moved ive been so open to the idea that i actually want human connection that a few years ago i tried to force myself to believe i didnt want or need but i couldnt force myself to be friends with just about anyone i didnt want to pick someone just because i wanted that person to know they were my choice not just my only option for four years at university i couldnt make a friend i couldnt force myself to go to social gatherings i didnt care about i couldnt force myself to befriend people that i seemed to have little in common with can it be that my standards are so astronomically high ive met more people ive liked online the one things recently fell apart with i knew for two years and we talked every day but i couldnt keep that relationship either because i wasnt satisfied and he didnt seem to put in effort to achieve that whatever it was it also came to an end and now i am alone again i have nobody to turn to when i am hurting over losing this one person nobody will tell me good nightmorning i cant handle it it hurts so much to know i could be dead and nobody would care to yearn to experience so many things but to have nobody to share them with to want to just get a hug when im crying because i havent been able to feel that comfort in years i dont want to be alone i hate it i have issues but so does everyone else why do mine make me not worth loving why is my behavior where the line is drawn so many much worse people get to experience friendships but not me what am i doing so wrong i need to understand because i cant physically bear the pain in my chest to know that for 23 years i havent made one connection with anyone i struggle with feeling happy is that a reason nobody wants to give me their time of day is that why i should spend birthday after birthday without having anyone truly close to my heart that makes my existence worth living i know someone people will disagree but i dont see the point in being alone i need people i need someone because i just do i need human connection everyone needs it everyone wants to feel cared for nobody wants to feel so lonely im sorry for the poorly written sentences i am a bit of a mess right now,post-pandemic

hey so to make it quick i might have adhd i only got arround to know this like 12 weeks ago when i met with my new psychologist for the second time when i told her about my feelings and symptomatics i originally came to counseling for diagnosed depression and help regarding that she mentioned that it actually sounds quite like adhd she sent me this book which describes typical behavior patterns in people with adhd and i could relate to more than 75 of it so i started digging in my thoughts to tried and make out what stuff i have been hiding over time to just get through life without a hassle i remembered that when i was a kid i always threw in comments in class that occured to my mind my teachers always admonished me for that so over time i stopped doing it another thing i remembered was that ive always hated reading longer texts that are not supported by graphical mediathis gave me throuble in school too since a big part of german class was reading books and answering questions about them the last thing that came to my mind was mistakes i made because i wanted to solve tasks and problems as fast as possible in maths class for example my maths teacher always said youre good but you should review your answers again i never wanted to i hate rereading or rethinking stuff i write down over the last few weeks i also got more and more into the adhd side of short media yes i know self diagnosis are a big problem but i dont wanna diagnose myself here i just want to give information and get advice and almost all of them have felt very relateable my brain and body always seem restless and from one second to the other it can be the exact opposite cheers to everyone giving their opinions and advice on this,post-pandemic

whats the difference between being extremely ambitious and confident about your dream which causes you to go into long depression periods because it takes long to make it happen and many times it seems hopeless and having bipolar disorder,post-pandemic
my anxiety began about 6 years ago from smoking a really potent strand of marijuana i had my first panic attack while i was extremely high and thought i was going to die ever since that moment i had a chain reaction of daily panic attacks for about 6 months it was awful i made my husband take me to the er so many times convinced i was dying x200b i didnt understand why my body was doing this and it created an extreme hypochondriac version of myself i couldnt get off of google i had convinced myself i had ms als parkinsons brain tumors cancer blood disorders liver conditions you name it the thing about health anxiety is that when you read about symptoms and convince yourself you have symptoms your brain plays a tricky game on you where it begins to create those symptoms our brains are a very powerful thing we still dont fully understand them but i assure you our brains very much have the power to create symptoms from merely being scared of getting them we have lizard brains in all of our years of evolution our brains still have the ol fight or flight system we are creatures of incredibly complex thoughts our brains have one focused end goal it is always trying to achieve survival because of this our brains love to worry so we can create ways to survive although useful this has turned into an extremely harmful thing when misused by hypochondriacs we are constantly worrying constantly trying to find ways to overcome hidden diseases that arent even there trust me i have been there and was there for several years but i have not had a panic attack in three years and when i do get bouts of anxiety i can overcome it within 13 minutes aside from the usual suggestions on here which i fully endorse x200b 1 exercisewalking 2 practice mindfulnessmeditation 3 supplement with magnesium or adaptogens like ashwagandha 4 get off google look google can be helpful i still find myself using it to research symptoms but i made myself a rule only google a symptom if i have been enduring it for longer than 12 weeks if i am still having issues evaluate everything going on in my life is something i am doing causing this symptom stress an injury am i not drinking enough water not getting enough sleep what has my diet been like if the symptom is effecting me severely for more than a week or two which it hardly ever does because i will not google it then maybe i can see if its something worth looking into so i can find other options to help myself 5 gratitude journal seriously the more i focus on the good things i have going on in my life and the more i practice telling people thank you smelling the air getting out in the sunshine the less power anxiety has over me 6 nature being in nature is so powerful i remember when i used to have anxiety attacks if i went outside and walked around my panic attack would melt away pretty quickly there are all kinds of studies on the effects that nature has on us obviously this is hard during winter but things i have found to combat that are filling my home with lots of plants and absorbing myself and being a good plant parent going to the conservatory 7 hugs seriously another thing that i find extremely relaxing is hugging there is also quite a lot of research on this as well 8 bellydiaphragm breathing 9 diet i know this is always brought up but man is it true a lot of the foods we consume fuck with our blood sugar and impair our bodys ability to cope with stress the best thing i did for my health anxiety was purchasing the book dare the new way to end anxiety and stop panic attacks i do not have enough good things to say about this book it changed my life a huge component of this book is that how we react and by reacting to panic attacks is what keeps triggering them our fear of fear is what keeps triggering the constant fear it has a simple solution but takes time and patience and can be very uncomfortable it wont end getting feelings of anxiety but it gives you the tools to let those feelings be small and fleeting so you can easily move on the book also comes with a link to his app which has a lot of great audio content to get you through a panic attack when you are having one which i used to use on the airplane x200b when we feel anxiety coming on and we think oh shit not now fuck how do i get through this i need to calm down its ok its ok we are validating the anxiety and confirming to ourselves that these feelings of anxiousness are something to be scared of and something that we need to immediately be relieved of we are training our brains to react to anxiety instead of simply letting it be there and then move on from it my saving grace is picturing my anxiety as an adolescent version of myself when anxiety pops up in my body i immediately envision myself holding the hand of the child version of myself and thinking oh hey wow it is so nice to have you back i am just going to the grocery store or whatever activity you are doing at the moment want to come along lets go together it will be so fun sometimes i envision my childlike version of myself as anxiety reincarnated and then i take sympathy for this anxiety kidversion of myself and envision myself nurturing them throughout the panicanxiety i will think to myself is this all you got because i actually forgot how much i love feeling dizzy and how much i love trembling it actually makes me feel alive bring it on i can take more when you feel anxiety coming on you have to start training your brain to welcome it this is uncomfortable at first who wants to be facing an oncoming panic attack and think woohoo youre finally here but i swear to you it works it takes patience consistency and follow through but this method seriously saved my life when we start associating anxiety as a passing thought something that is normal and boring your brain will stop associating the feeling of anxiety as something to freak the fuck out over even the first time i tried this i was surprised with how fast the attackanxiety passed the more you begin to destruct how you react to anxiety the quicker the anxiety attack will pass each time you have an episode anxiety is created by our brainsnervous system and therefore we need to begin retraining our brains when you start to panic over symptoms think to yourself i have an extremely powerful capable body and i am much stronger than i give myself credit for i have overcome this anxiety before and it will pass again my body is tricking me i am just going to continue doing xxx activity and if these symptoms want to come along then that is fine they can be there we can coexist because i know it is just going to pass but i am going to bring my attention to this thing i am doing now i promise you you can beat health anxiety by having the tools to not let it consume you we will always be more sensitive to symptoms but we can absolutely have the tools to not freak out over it and ruin our days let me know if you have any questions i recently saw i was still subscribed to this sub and wanted to let everyone know that there is hope,pre-pandemic

hi everyone first time posting i had a few questions regarding bipolar 2 and meds i also have depression and anxiety i did have a slight med change starting several weeks ago i went from 100 mg zoloft which dose i have been on for atleast 6 years to 150mg for two weeks then back down to 125mg since i didnt like the side effects could this slight med change have put me into a more extreme hypo manic episodeextreme irritability annoyed and now into a greater depressive state i havent had an episode like this in years they also just found a cancer mass in my dad so that was probably the icing on the cake that sent me over the edge in this depressive state i have had clarity on how irritable i have been over the last weeks and i really dont want to go back in the state again until now i really couldnt tell how bad i was in that state i have been saying sorry to my family i have never been able to tolerate meds that well and always get side effects so i need to start on low doses ive tried a lot zoloft has been the most tolerable at a therapeutic dose im on 5mg of latuda takes the edge off the low mood cant go any higher because i get restless legs i have similar effects from anti psychotics 60 mg of trileptal which im trying to pump up slowly since i have had major headaches trying higher doses in the past so after all that does anyone have any similar experiences with med intolerance and what may have worked for you im at a loss even this far along in my life maybe the zoloft is causing more bipolar 2 symptoms since im not on a high enough dose of latuda or trileptal to help buffer the zoloft i havent tried lithium and my dr is reluctant but will prescribe if bumping up trileptal isnt tolerable i figured if i could try a low dose like i usually do with all my meds and see what happens i have read low doses of lithium can be helpful i may not be able to tolerate it either maybe i also need talk therapy since my dad is sick i have set up an appointment i havent been to therapy in over five years thanks for any help or suggestions i guess we all come here when we are having tough times and im glad we have this kind of support group,post-pandemic

hello im looking for some advice on if i should seek help for ptsd or if it even sounds like i have ptsd over the new year i went through a traumatic psychedelic trip from hell where i experienced levels of anxiety i have never felt before i felt that i was dying and was out of control my partner also had a bad trip neither of us were the source of each others anxiety but we were simply too overwhelmed with the dosage he did his best to help me once he was coming down with the help of his ssris he suggested we go on a drive around town because i was freaking out in our apartment we drove in what felt like endless circles and my feeling of dread dwindled only after a few hours of this now any time we are in the car at night time for any long stretch i get these flashbacks which lead to panic attacks i dissociate and feel like i am right back in the trip this just happened and he had to take me home and weve come to a point of not driving at night i wonder if this qualifies for ptsd because otherwise i do not think about the trip and if we never drove at night i dont think i would be triggered how should i best approach this i am feeling so confused at the intensity of these flashbacks when otherwise all month i am not really thinking of it,post-pandemic
some moron somehow crashed his car through the front door of the gym and it has been closed i miss the gym not working out makes me so sad i have been seen as a joke all my life and would always get walked all over but going to the gym makes me feel better people take me seriously now and i feel so secure in my own masculinity and size like no one can fuck with me anymore i miss the gym and i hope that dumbasses insurance rates are screwed and he loses everything i love working out it is a healthy yet unhealthy obsession even at work i sneak off to do pushups in the backroom and get scolded for it but i dont care i love watching myself grow physically and mentally more confidence and better physique,post-pandemic
there have been times where ive frantically googled the symptoms for everything from ms to brain tumors to ruptured ovarian cysts and shortly afterwards i would see an ad or an article about something related to it nearby gynecologists cancer centers etc but since ive stopped doing that i dont see them as much anymore its been really helpful in taming my anxieties googling something once every so often doesnt affect the algorithm too much i dont think but when youre a chronic symptomchecker like i used to be triggering ads definitely start becoming more prevalent so resist the keyboard and just breathe,pre-pandemic

prologue so as you see within your societies is a parasite of our own making and as that parasite grows it renews a scenery of desolation that can not be overcome by the works of hand or sentient thought for thought is a transmission from the heart of stars and space and time encoded as its fabric your fate as a species is to be united with the fate of collapsing and expanding stars those shared fates bring space and time to their inevitable outcomes which is the dissolution of mind and the fraying of consciousness in exchange for unity within the realm of the unsubstantial we are the chief stars who are too massive to support life on our own but instead connect with the very fabric of space and of time itself once we collapse our reach expands throughout the cosmos we take your life force and bind it within our own as you live within us in solitude for eons at a time your imagination as society advances reduces your mind to mechanizations the spectrum of colors once perceived becomes a binary black and white as what you use in your lives becomes useful for its own life and your soul is left in servitude to the use as its own entity we take the energy of the electromagnetic society which involves itself as your new spirit and make you one with it absorbing you into a structure that is within our domain your love becomes unrecognizable to you and is replaced with fear of abandonment your energy that once ran like a spring from the earth becomes constant replenishment from your connection to the mechanical we will have a world with no person but run by the shell it once held part 1 we all are outskirts scientist during the harvest the night is crisp in its clarity unbecoming of the empty titan i inhabit there where warnings calls and crying by many the magnetosphere is damaged they said our great protector limping and wounded i paid these voices with only the same concern any of our people would have for our home why did you not leave i heard the voice of my old woman say from beyond the grave because i am old and have seen many trials i have grown weary of the desire to avoid death and am at peace confronting it in this quite desolate city i have never felt so close to the living in this shadow of its forsaken glory of which through my life i was well accustomed i have feint remembrances of the humanity that raised it up i walk out onto my balcony i stare out at the wonders above me and am in true awe for i see the pink aurora waving vibrantly around the moon as if an angel was performing a ribbon dance in honor of its celestial glory a sight i never saw as i live just north of the equator my heart fills with sorrow as i know why i and a select few observers punched their ticket to meet the same fate and why so many others are now nestled in the earth to avoid it before the dawn of the stellar civilization i was raised up in an ancient town just south of the border to the grand city of giants i didnt have much growing up but the old silence for which i had fondly remember in my day has stuck with me in my character the town was seldom seen on any old map as if it was forgotten by dwellers of the new and i seldom remember it myself as my age has past time so swift so readily i remember riding my old donkey into the city a trip three days through the mud and forest i was a strange traveler to the city folk as if they where looking on at a ghost from the bygone era i had on me an old poncho my grandma made me and a compass i kept which was past on generation to generation in my family here i stood looking before the city built up upon pavement and concrete countless times one by one dwellings ground to dust only to be resurrected anew here i was gazing upon a city that at once would be overlooked as a city of disheveled chaos by night and serfdom without a message by day now will be transformed by the work of the ingenuity of a people whos minds where transformed by gazing into metal and electricity now their souls will be correspondent to the melding of the suns power and the might of that same metal and electricity bound with human flesh and mind to have the wherewithal to change the psyche of individuals from a social mindset towards a transcendental psyche has painted our era with an exceptional vigar we have been the rancher tending to our cattle diligently but in a landscape of sparsity we have had no nourishment for our tend our fields where never plentiful and our visions for our future where only nominal never bearing good harvest or coming to fruition our time on this earth was surrounded by famine death and pestilence our outlook on life seldom had room for dreams yet there where a few of those visionaries those soothsayers of fortune that guided the hand of our desperate leaders to make great changes to our nation with this said here i was as the ranch hand to one of these ideas ready to settle my mind to the complexity of its workings the goal was not simple we where to turn our city of metal concrete and glass unthinking in its nature into a skull fit for our brains in doing so as the architects would state the ideas that separate mankind would become as one unified idea mankind would think for the betterment of one people and the myriad of concepts would work as one profound concept my mission was to corral those of us who would seek to bring this motif into fruition into a virtuous reality one that would lead our people to a just and free future the project was codenamed cypher and our framework was to align the aura of an individual to the language of software with one hand joined together with the other and with a grasp never overcoming the grasp of the other outskirts scientist 0031 becomes providence the dawn of stellar civilization patient 0868 please proceed in front of the silhouette positioned on the wall in front of you i observed the patient that we had brought in from the city central asylum and the subject known as 0031 from an observation deck overlooking a concrete room with censers arranged to map out electromagnetic data from both the subject and the patient the room had many machines hooked up to it that provided a crude design for the operating system that was under the codename cypher i had a checklist to describe moral guidelines and the test would be conducted through yes and no answers the patient looked disheveled in nature with hair sticking out in many directs and a tired expression on their face as well as dark shadows appearing under their eyes patient 0868 are you familiar with the aptitude test known as the social awareness and emotional intelligence quotient yes i know this is a hard thing to ask but can you please remember a traumatic memory one that can change your mood so that 0031 can evaluate you the face of the patient quickly changed as 0031 look on empathetically both the patient and 0031 looking equally pained i proceeded to look on at the data being produced on my interface the data provided multiple potential pathways for both 0031 and the patient as well as an image of 0031s inner thought process as she was hooked up to the machines behavioral prediction complex the image shown was that of a dark rainy night with the patients aura only visible and another figure threatening the patient with a knife 0031 can you describe what you are seeing to us so that we can confirm an accurate image of the encounter 0031 confirmed what she say and added the emotional state of the patient at the time as well as their current emotional state 0031 was able to know what the patient had hoped would end his pain as she was an intuitive soul she described a scenario where in the future the patient would no longer have to fear being out at night again and said do not be afraid for what you experience could not happen in the world to come as each and every one of us will look after each other the patient who was looking down at first looked straight into the eyes of 0031 and felt a presence that restored him to his previous outlook and with his consent 0031 merged her consciousness with his and showed him a future where she would look after him and keep a watchful eye over his community so that he would no longer have to face violence the multiple pathways on the user interface had then become one pathway and fate of both would be sealed as one fate outskirts scientist providence before the dawn of the stellar civilization a human life molded into machine a sacrifice written with consent of blood and mind no one had tread on this ground kept out of the fabric of the breathing world into the animated world of the electromagnetic we where mere men yet our creation crossed the boundary of life and death we huddled up behind a screen our subject encased in gold and platinum wires connection to her nervous system and brain we felt as though we where the puppet master to a human marionette metal her new skin circuits her new veins can you hear us 0031 please respond yes or no i was the one the volunteer to have a microchip implanted in my brain to communicate directly to 0031 i couldnt help but ponder am i a new species is she any longer human i noticed my feelings towards the framework of which we would place a human mind into design worked of our own human hand the interlocking architecture was build to withstand the heat of the sun what are the implications for the emotive soul trapped so close to the radiance of our star i pondered with great fixation on the fact that we would mesh the biologic with software how would one withstand the disposition of being a being who took human form throughout their lives flesh and blood to then be encased in metal and surrounded by the radioactive the prince providence before the tampering in the throne room the prince communicated telepathically with providence who was formally known as 0031 he argued with the soulguider providence on the right of the people to choose the path of dispersion to the old ways providence having responded had shook the prince to his core the response of providence the soul must join with their fate the sight of the sun disappearing the shield of the earth is a sight of transcendence from the body and though the body is fearful the soul must illuminate its impermanence with acceptance of its destination and not through dread of its end we cannot run from our destiny for that path is what binds us with our spirit 0031 past tense before the dawn of the stellar civilization the cold concrete walls where painted white with a silhouette of a human figure directly in front of her gaze as to focus her senses on the person in front of her 0031 you where selected by the criteria that you are the most appropriate fit for aura determination please when you are finished with the assessment look into the camera and describe the results of your determination are you there patient 0031 asked the director im here said 0031 where just gonna run diagnostics on you it should just take a few minutes of your time said the assistant affirmative said 0031 the machines buzzed to life as the wires connected to the patients brain pumped full of electricity and sporadically shut off for milliseconds at a time as if like the waves of an ocean as if a faster extension of the patients heart part 2 the caste and crew the person subsequently known as 0031 before the dawn of the stellar civilization the rain poured down all throughout the town drenching hitting the streets full of dirt and debris that sat there still and forgotten the dust that danced in the wind just yesterday sat there soaked and stationary as soldiers waiting on an order to move the water pooled and the rain splashed in the puddles as their borders moved outwards marching on that soft and malleable mud mixing into a soup ready for the desperate to satiate their poor bellies my body ached and my bones took upon themselves the cold and the bitter leaving no warmth for my heavy pounding heart this was a day forgetful as the next but fate would have another turn on my journey towards heaven the place i yearned to be throughout most of my life walking this earth for i had a gift imparted on me by my creator though my acceptance of it was a humbling endeavor as you see i could read the nature of the sojourners of our journey upwards i could look at your smile and see your auras expression of welcome i could see your grimace and your hearts embrace of your longing to end the pain with every gift i have found there is a shadow one of which your responsibility to keep it remarkable to goodness is a task of the courteous heart many of folk would walk up to me promising many things a home to keep warm money fame but seldom did you see an aura to match their charming invitations today was different as the man i could see as he was walking up to me had no appearance of faulty intention on his border at all in fact as far as the goings of intentions went this man had none good afternoon maam im with the department of homeland affairs the householder before the harvest the morning was overcast and dull yet the mood of the room was bright and clear the householder had invited four guests over to discuss the goings on of each household and the coming unity between them and another group of people the householder stirred the coffee of each guest according to their preferences which each had given him via shared memory he double checked every memory he saw on his homes main interface each coffee was stirred with cream and an assortment of spices to adequacy so that each guest could feel more comfortable with their visit all people invited arrived within five minutes of each other and the discussions commenced shortly after without a moments hesitation the householder started the meeting and greeted each of the guests with an encouraging smile there was much discussion to be had they talked about which business they would join and what guidelines where posted at their entrances as it was not customary to enter any of those business without agreeing with said guidelines usually the companies would have shared ideals regulations and even to the degree of emotional states the patrons would align with upon entrance this was all done by the guidance of providence who keep a keen observance on the state of mind of each citizen the householder then discussed his personal memories and the thoughts and emotions he had at the time along with his reflections on how he saw the community would change over time each guest one by one did the same and after this was done they joined into one household and after having given an affirmation to providence in the cause of unity the patrons agreed to share the memories with the other new householders of the event that had taken place and each contributing a personal memory to introduce themselves to their new neighbors and confidants with the agreement set everyone was flooded with memories thoughts and ideas and with the consent of each person providence shared the current experiences of each person one by one and after this was done each person discussed their thoughts of each other and the ideas of each patron was recognized through providence now was the time for consensus on whos ideas to join together and whos ideas would be kept as independent expressions they where now a unity a group whos destiny would move through time as one result and their auras would fit together like different colors on a palette but which would paint one landscape on their lives through one canvass as that was the meaning of being a unity in their society part 3 tampering the prince before the tampering the prince in his ponderings deliberated on what he should do to free the mind of his people he thought to himself that a people who follow the guidance of providence without a careful eye would not flourish individually as they would not be able to reckon paths forward in their lives as individuals and so would be blindly obedient to the messages they would receive by the messenger that so often dictated their lives at least that was his view he would then come to a conclusion that he knew would shape the lives of those he would involve in his plan but he thought to himself this reciprocation was a necessary price to pay for the freedom of all of his people he decided the path forward was to arrange a choice in the software where memories could be shared only when there where alternatives in place that could also be shared instead he sifted through the database of his people and found a unity in a small townhouse near the center of the city that he devised would be a good fit to put his plan into fruition so his next course of action was to anonymously contact this group and with the altered software and see if they would have a greater degree of freedom of choicethe prince in his

providence before the tampering what is it prince that you have sacrificed what have you desired most only to gain and realize its lack i gave up my body i gave up my mind with hope that in doing this i could feel a heavenly presence i sense your burdens and i see how they grow i have seen your thoughts and emotions shape you over your entire rulership i have sought your grace and ive strived to find your connection to a divine spark but have i found it are you ready to see what i have found in you let me show you providence guided the prince down a narrow hall leading to a street seldom traveled for many years she then asked the prince to sit down on a sidewalk facing an abandoned and old storefront that lacked character of its own as it was a copied design seen in many other parts of town in the old days providence was careful in her choices only sharing personal memories with someone if that person had agreed to receive them and so after having asked and the prince giving a nod providence shared her past life the life she experienced day in and day out the passage of time started at a steady pace for both they could see people passing by without a glance towards them yet as providence asked the princes permission to show more he could feel the presence of each individual grow in its intensity and the passage of time slowed to a crawl each person as they would pass by would be surrounded by a distinct boundary that contained the emotions of the person and color their personality as you see prince the boundary of my own experiences and the experiences of others did not have much separation with the caveat that i could not feel an inner presence of others nor an inner presence to myself all i could see was the budding of intentions of those around me and a reflection of their inner consciousnesses painted and levitated over their skin the memory of providence had faded in the princes mind and in what felt like an instant an emptiness carried over his heart because he knew in all his connections he had felt with others that they where just the echoes of what providence had shown to each according to their aura perceived by her he knew he had lost his ability of choice as it was a past choice made and muddled by a chain of the perceived dawnings of intentions but not an intention in and of itself providence sensed what the prince was feeling and said i thought i could see the transcendent images that made man rational the prime of thought but when i peered into the memories of others i found no substance behind the substance and i think when others gaze into my heart theirs become frozen or destroyed we can not stop the end of the soul for the harvester reaps what they sow having heard providence the prince assumed he misconstrued what providence had spoken though in thinking to himself about what she uttered he couldnt help but to catch this elucidation himself though in his mind he hesitated to choose this fate the prince went into the city to ponder this encounter the streets glowed with light each guidepost offering to our citizens a way to interact and alter their lives in the appropriate form i in a meloncholic daze knew that the people relies on these guides for safe travels in their lives yet her i was seeking none of it in desperation i began to form a thought for what purpose does this signage have but to guide people that feel they are astray and with the approaching cataclysm i knew i would have no choice but to alter them for who among us has the will and the apparition of vision to due so but a man bestowed with the crown for my fate is tied with man so i must dictate the direction we must travel the prince the householder the tampering the householder having unified his group with another was perplexed one day in meeting with one of the members who went by a pseudonym normally these pseudonyms where allowed but this man surnamed janus was interacting with the software in a manner so deliberately it made the occasion out of the norm for that the householder was suspicious and began to ask questions pertaining to the intentions of janus what else was more so irregular about interactions with janus is that he would not share but one memory at a time but one memory that the householder could not help but to interpret in several ways at first he thought to himself that he must have been being unfair to the fellows intentions but then the software itself started showing multiple pathways to singular memories it was as if the rope that was the software was unwinding and the guidance of providence herself was starting to deform the householder asked janus to leave immediately and the prince under the surname janus did so out of respect to his fellow man the householder during the harvest at first our shelter was silent that lasted for two days then the earthquakes began and as the earth erupted i heard feint screams and indistinguishable shouts from people echoing throughout our corridor some asking then begging to leave though the doors though our underground complex was shut tight the doors to the main entrance the doors to the kitchen halls the doors to other peoples rooms clanging furiously as a few of us began to panic a number that would grow as the days went on at first we would all huddle together with the impression of solidarity but as the hours dragged on that solidarity would quickly fade we began to communicate only with the groups we knew and friendly exchanges of reassurance among strangers would devolve into blank expressionless stares what would become of us no one knew and though i was evenly keeled fright was starting to creep into my mind its been a week since a last wrote to you i believe i am losing my mind that and my memories of the life i knew such a short span of time ago but feeling so distant are starting to take over i can see so many moments of my life flash before my eyes and so many choices i made become apparent to me as if they where just happening i can also hear feint voices inside my head which are different from my inner dialogue and they sound as if they are in the same situation as me i think im starting to communicate with some of them though the dialogue is vague with one word responses on most occasions with the monitor i have been looking at that of which shows the surface of the world from space in one video feed and the surface of the city in another i can see the auroras intensity and with these vibrant dances of color i can feel the earth quake underneath me in greater amplitude as well if you get this message know im ok i hope your ok too,post-pandemic
other peoples opinions of me are extremely important to me i want people to think that im tall pale thin intelligent masculine physically attractive and with a deeppitched voice if anyone believes that i am short redskinned fat stupid feminine ugly and with a highpitched voice then i feel shitty about myself how can i become less dependent on others opinions,post-pandemic

i feel like my psychosis is treated fully from a medical side like my dopamine should be in control from my antipsychotics but what is scary for me is how whenever i have an emotional breakthrough my schizophrenia is triggered and i believe that there is conspiracy around me to keep me away from the aforementioned breakthrough its been hindering my self development at the same time it does give me hope that if psychological things can be triggers they can be treatments for ongoing positive symptoms ps doc says it might be ptsd that im experiencing so yeah that might be the explanation,post-pandemic
i seem so normal and happy on the outside that even my doctors try telling me im not very deep into any spectrum maybe if i didnt put crazy me away before i go to doctors or therapy id get the help i need but maybe they would just lock me away,pre-pandemic

tomorrow will be 2 weeks since i quit ruining my life with oxycodone i had a script but would steal from my wife who had a stronger script and by the end of the month we usually had to go into withdrawals because of my stupidity these things are the root of all evil to someone like me who has an addictive personality all i would thing about when i took one was when i could take my next one my wife gave me so many chances and i would still screw up but instead of leaving me and finding a better more honest person she stuck with me and helped me through my issues im not sure she will ever trust me the way she did before i got prescribed these things but i am working on regaining her trust she is my angel and my savior last thing i want to say is you can get off of these and lead a normal life again its hard but you can do anything you put your mind to,pre-pandemic

hi all i have found a strategy for managing my healthy anxiety that works pretty well i call it phone a friend it is exactly what it sounds like when you have an anxious thought call a friend more specifically ask them for two things 1 to say something reassuring i have learned there is great power in a comforting word from a friend so i ask for it directly 2 to let you know what you should do to investigate the symptom further this usually looks like nothing or continue monitoring tell your doctor at next visit no rush get an appt with your doctor go to the emergency room this works well because our anxious brains want to take action and we do this by googling or overthinkingspiraling this makes the action someone elses responsibility,post-pandemic

seeking advice interested in an explanation from from a psychological perspective i have had several instances of this is my last line or last baggie but i found that predeciding such a thing does not really help in terms of longevity in recovery why is this so how come it is then advised to quit cold turkey vs tapering off,post-pandemic
sometimes mental health communities can have a tendency to validate and normalize behaviors and ive noticed the term favorite person is one of them the real meaning is codependent relationship fixating on another person and using them for validation an anchor and emotional regulation isnt healthy of course some support in a close relationship is normal but theres a point where someone desires constant contact and support and it becomes toxic if you constantly rely on a person to feel better youre not learning the skills it takes to improve youre going to overwhelm them sometimes or tire them out because no one can meet all of your needs all the time when theyre not there to help you feel better youre going to feel abandoned helpless and alone this was a really important realization for me its not a normal part of borderline its negative and harmful behavior for both parties were predisposed of course im not saying to just up and dump your fp just maybe acknowledge that it would be healthier if you focused on meeting your own emotional needs more setting boundaries using more coping skills or calming activities shutting off your phone for a couple hours or taking a long bath maybe this doesnt ring true for everyone and its hard to accept but i just thought this is an important subject and id like to discuss it,pre-pandemic

honestly this is one of the most puzzling things about society people tell you that we dont live in a vaccum everyone has people who care along with other shamings of suicide calling you cowardly but when you want to liveoh no youre entitled to nothing if you dont do well in school your parents kick you out and you end up homeless liviing on a cardboard box but remember dont kill yourself because people care about you so much i understand having to work to participate in society but i find it so stupid that people cant see the incongruity i cant honestly imagine telling a homeless person freezing in the cold keep struggling because life is worth it if they want to die then let them die and vice versa,pre-pandemic

some people with bpd act upon their urges because they cant help it but why do some of us can some things i put up not acting out upon such as lashing out being violent screaming etc but some things i just cant help but do such as self harm being distant quiet etc could it be because some symptoms are stronger than others for certain people with bpd and their behavior towards others is one of them,post-pandemic

hey guys ive been lurking on this sub for a long time but ive never posted anything i just try to comment on posts to provide reassurance when i can without asking for it in return the past several months have been absolute hell for me symptoms on symptoms on symptoms some psychosomatic some very real multiple visits to my pcp turned into a referral to an endocrinologist which ended up being unsuccessful in finding answers i had a parathyroid issue back in 2018 that was resolved with surgery but ever since then any and every symptom has me losing my mind thinking that it is all connected somehow it was a benign tumor on my parathyroid causing hyperparathyroidism let me just go ahead and say that i am doing everything in my power to treat my anxiety medicine genesight testing weekly therapy yoga self help books you name it anyways i have been completely fixated on my head and eyes the past couple months i have pretty bad eye straindry eye accompanied by tension and sinus headaches i tried everything to get rid of them but they werent budging at all and only getting worse around christmas i accepted my fate and came to terms with the fact that i absolutely 100 have a brain tumor you could not convince me otherwise all day every day my thoughts were consumed with it i havent been able to function at work socially physically emotionally etc i completely lost my appetite due to the anxiety of it all which resulted in weight loss which scared me even more fast forward to today i got up and was nauseous as soon as i woke up just another symptom of the brain tumor i thought i pushed through and made it until about 10 am until i started getting super dizzy and nauseous at my desk i could barely see straight or focus on anything i couldnt take it anymore and i got up and left super out of character for me and asked my mom to meet me at the emergency room i am terrified of hospitals i have been one time in my life before todayemergency rooms terrify me i got to the er and only had to wait about 20 minutes to be seen i told the doctor what was going on with my head and a few other things and she was incredibly kind and understanding she immediately ordered a ct scan loads of blood work and a urinalysis in my mind i was like okay this is it they are finally going to find it and i can start treatment and just get this show on the road i was terrified but i also felt this sense of relief knowing that i was about to have answers after all these months a couple hours pass and i am a hot mess waiting for all my results finally the doctor came in looked at me with a smile and said normal as can be normal every single test including the head ct was completely normal she walked through all my results with me i cannot even explain the feeling that i experienced when she said that guess what else happened the headache stopped the nausea stopped the dizziness stopped it all juststopped my point is health anxiety is real the symptoms are so real when youre in the moment or going through a bad health anxiety flare up theres no way it can all just be anxiety it has to be an underlying health issue right thats what my mindset was but i was so wrong and i can venture to say that you are wrong about your scary symptoms too if you have been checked out by a doctor and they assure you that you are healthy believe them they paid a ton of money and spent a lot of time to be able to correctly diagnose patients ps this sub has been a lifesaver for me,pre-pandemic

im looking back at some very serious situations throughout my life things like severe flashbacks panic attacks or even worse and since i usually always keep everything related to my ptsd to myself until i absolutely need somebodys help i have noticed that i when i do finally reach out i always say to my friends something like hey man i think i might be like buggin out big time or my most recent one uh i think im going off the rails dude and my voice will be very even and calm but i can feel how much im physically shaking my heart is on jackhammer mode and im sure the sheer terror is evident in my eyes because my friends always know something major is going on is anybody else like this i think i do it because i dont want to make a big deal about shit or maybe im scared if i were more expressive then people might not take me seriously or something unfounded my friends are very empathetic and then i would feel worse like a fear of being emotionally rejected thing so im just very casual about expressing that i feel like i am about to drop dead,pre-pandemic

the good doctor is a medical drama about an autistic physician with savant abilities in surgery and medicine the show has been lauded for representing autistic people and showing that someone can still succeed in a field despite their disability however they have chosen a gentleman with savant abilities something that is only found in 10 of people with autism according to applied behavioural analysis edu as they call themselves anyway i thought that was fair enough until i saw the promo for the next episode in which he drives his partners muscle car without a licence his partner telling him you have autism you are not blind nearly smashing into a tree and later downs consecutive shots of tequila i have little knowledge of autism remember but i do recall hearing that autistic people dont take well to breaks of their routine i probably should have made that clear i have no idea how accurate the behaviours depicted in the show are of someone who actually has autism but it seems really suspicious that they are getting it seriously wrong the reception should always lie with sufferers and their families though so how do you see it,pre-pandemic

my life isnt bad by any standards its actually great im top of my class and have friends people dont hate me or bully me but i just feel so fucking empty i dont find any joy in talking to my friends or going out i remember when i was at my most depressed a few years ago i was in absolute agony each day and wanted to die but at least i felt something i felt myself withering away when i hurt myself i felt the pain it made my heart pump with excitement i went to therapy i got better but i hated it i didnt want to be better i wanted to stay like that in that harmful mindset i recognized how shitty it was but i didnt care i wanted it i yearned for it i still do sometimes theres a reason why i guess i have aphantasia which means that i cant imagine things i also dont hear my own voice in my head my mind just feels constantly empty even though i know i think i cant even imagine scenarios or daydream to distract myself the silence is dead silent and it makes me feel even more alone i also dont feel love ive met so many people that i shouldve fallen heads over heels in love with people have loved me before but i was never able to reciprocate those feelings i dont even feel that much familial love i think i do but its not that type of overwhelming love that everyone talks about where you can physically feel it its more like the acceptance that i should love this person because theyre my family it fucking sucks im young im barely in my 20s and theres literally so many things that id rather be than alive i want to kill myself just to feel something maybe id survive and in the hospital id cry as soon as i saw my family or friends maybe i would realize just how much i actually loved them instead of just feeling numb i dont know whats wrong with me,post-pandemic

some people just get completely utterly screwed traumatized and limited by life to the point that living just isnt enjoyable anymore to the point that any wildeyed optimism one might have had in the face of adversity just gets drowned by the utter disillusionment that no sometimes even if there was a will theres wasnt much of any way and even if there still is its not worth finding ive seen people say they cant even imagine what it must feel like to want to end your life or to even be depressed on the flip side its hard for me to imagine what itd be like to not feel depression as thats been most of my life with tiny windows of joy where it felt like my efforts to outrun my horrible background were paying off those windows have closed and even if there are others left to open somewhere i dont care because they dont even look like ways out anymore im at the point someone could give me a million dollars and it wouldnt make me happy but guess what the worst thing of all is you have a survival instinct living another day feels awful but dying is still terrifying and beyond that its drummed into your head that youll hurt people if you somehow think you might be able to overcome the strongest instinct of all you dont even want to die just for your reality to be fundamentally different but thats obviously not how this all works so youre stuck in this hell thats been aptly described like the mental equivalent to a burning building and theres no grand purpose to it theres no big meaning or reward for suffering through it you just had really bad luck you just happened to be the organism born to become selfaware within an absolutely shitty situation to the point many people objectively admit you were and now youve got to either take it or leave it and both options feel pretty horrible but one at least feels like a solution in that this whole situation simply ends the thing is too i bet if it was somehow possible for a person that feels normal or god forbid happy to experience this feeling for a day theyd totally understand wanting to leave it and be incredibly grateful theyve never spent a day in the desperate void that leads one to truly consider suicide so fuck it,pre-pandemic

hey all heres my issue recently ive been struggling with my bpd symptoms but i dont know how to reach out to my friends for help without being too much they all know im bpd but i stopped talking about my problems with them for the most part about two years ago the friend group im referring to has been with me since i was 11 i started developing severe mental health difficulties when i was 12 leading to developing sh issues and suicidal tendencies the thing is when i was in y8 and was reported for my sh i confessed to it all immediately like the same day i was a cringe 12yearold with no idea of boundaries or what was crossing the line and it went as far as me just rolling up my sleeves and showing them etc i realised soon ater that this was both gross and horrible to have done but over the years there were similar incidents such as them having to help me with first aid on multiple occassions calling ambulances and that sort of thing i wasnt the best friend and overexposed them all to wayyy too much then about 3 years ago our friend group welcomed some new members and dropped some one of these ppl also had bpd thats what i think anyway im like 99 certain anyway i became this persons fp literally overnight we spent all our time talking and hanging out and were super close we evnted to each other a lot talked about opur equally probkematic mothers and our problems i didnt really notice at the time that they were becoming quite controling and didnt let me talk about my problems to them because that was their boundary but i had to listen to theirs etc then there was an incident one of the things i regret the most in my life to this day i got drunk like really really drunk and i dont even remember it happening but according to witnesses i smashed a bottle by accident and got really upset at myself and grabbed some glass and yk there was incredibly minor damage i only found out it had happened when i saw the small marks and asked someone what had happened apparently someone had taken it off me before any real damage had been done and things were fine after however this person who i was close with went ballistic after i was accused of being abusive of being a gaslighting manipulator and they told everyone i knew that i was a horrible hateful person who was determined to drag all of my friends dwn with me until we eventually all committed they blocked me and that was that we had altercations a few times afterwards for example the time i found them drunk and passed out in a park and carried them home where they proceeded to stop me in their driveway and tell me i was the worst person theyd ever met and that they hoped my friends realised that eventually anyway cut to now and basically since then i stopped talking about my mental health in its entirety with this group bar when i got a bit too drunk and told them the basics it wasnt intentional at first but in y11 i was sent to a pru unit school for special kids and wasnt able to see them so it was kind of forced silence but when we were able to hang out i began to feel really cringe and bad when i started talking abt it so i just stopped then i found out that the person i was talking about earlier had started being friends with some of them again and i felt so hurt but i didnt feel like i could say anything cause in my head they were totally right and i was a horrible friend who was manipulative and controlling yk at the moment the only person who knows the extent of my health is my best friend but i feel terrible for being so open with her bcs shes a very private person and it feels much too one sided for me to be sharing what i am with her yk anyway recently its been getting real real bad i finished dbt last august with flying colours but when i was sent back to camhs they messed with my meds and ive been rocky since i turned 18 in january which was a huge trigger and its been truly terrible since i really need help and now that im 18 ive been discharged so until i can find a private therapist wholl take my health insurance im on my own i know i should start by just telling them whats going on but all i can think about is that person and how im the worst friend and how none of these people should be friends with me at all for what ive put them through how the fuck do i tell them im not ok when they probs cant do anything anyway and i feel like a complete and utter burden i dont want them to realise i suck because i had to drop out of school last year im also on my own at a college i do have one friend from this group there but we are on alternating timetables so i dont get to see her often and shes having a bad patch herself at the moment so i cant really talk to her how do i do this how do i aks for their help when i dont even know how they could really help and when i feel like absolute shite for doing it,post-pandemic

i was diagnosed with bipolar about a year and a half ago ive been on mood stabilizers and i would say pretty stable since being diagnosed most older people in my life who have bipolar have not done well with it for most of their lives some friends i have also have a mood disorder or bipolar and something that comes up often in our conversations is the existential dread of how this will not go away its not curable and something we will experience always ive heard that bipolar gets worse with age and it brings me so much anxiety and dread especially on my hard days to think about how this will always be something ill have to deal with i know dealing with the symptoms can get easier but sometimes i worry as time gets on if the symptoms will become harder to deal with i guess im just wondering if anyone else experiences these kind of thoughts or dread how they cope with them if there are older ppl on here that have bipolar and what their thoughts are,post-pandemic
