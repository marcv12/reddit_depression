hello everyone over the past 12 years my girlfriends brother has slowly slipped into psychosis it started as paranoia he was being watchedfollowed but over the past couple months these feelings have drastically intensified to an obsession with his paranoid thoughts about half a year ago he attempted to take his own life and was admitted to an inpatient psych unit where he was prescribed a pretty strong antipsychotic this seem to help for a little bit but as of now his symptoms are worse than ever he messages my girlfriend basically 247 texting her all of his delusions many of which are quite frightening initially my girlfriend would just respond with compassion let him know were here for him empathize with how scary his thoughts are and never challenge his beliefs however it has become impossible for her to keep up with the shear volume of texting as he can text her for hours on end without stopping for what its worth his thoughts consist of being followed phone being hacked thinking his close family including my gf planted recording devices in the walls of his room and he consistently asked my girlfriend to just tell me where the cameras are he thinks his coworkers are messing with him he thinks the government is going to jail him for being a pedophile hes not he thinks hes seen pictures of his butt photo shopped onto other people online he often talks to himself through texting my girlfriend he believes that the hospital workers from when he hospitalized are conspiring against him and believes they are planning on harming my girlfriend and much much more scary thoughts recently with things as bad as they are my girlfriend and her father attempted to get him to self admit to inpatient psychological care and he responded very poorly as you could imagine he claims he is not suicidal but often sends ominous texts that are just vague enough to make my girlfriend very anxious he is consistently buying xanax and adderall off of the street as well to self medicate we frankly have no idea what to do were very worried for his safety and want him to get better but were not sure he will without medical intervention that he is refusing vehemently if anyone could offer any type of advice as to what to do if would be beyond appreciated tldr gfs brother is experiencing paranoid delusions and is refusing any type of help,post-pandemic

coming here wondering if anyone has had any similar experiences ive noticed fairly consistently that the only people i find myself interested in i tend to develop an extreme devotion and almost obsession with before we become anything serious or even anything at all it becomes incredibly frustrating to have a person who youre interested in never be a little piece of your life but rather your whole world every action means something every time they spend too long to replythey sound different it means something it gets so exhausting but also incredibly annoying i hate that my world revolves around a person who could never be as infatuated with me as i am with them and my reactions to these things have never been minor ive had countless uncontrollable breakdowns from things people have donehavent done over such minor things and above anything it feels humiliating i know i get fairly clingy early on with a fp and it often throws them off or scares them away but it often feels as if i cant help it i desire so badly to find someone who feels the way i do i hope im not alone and maybe there are others who have had similar experiences,post-pandemic

i dont know how to explain it to anyone who doesnt get it i dont really go around telling people i have anxiety my close friends know my family knows but i feel like i also dont fit the picture of someone who has anxiety and im finding out now that there are several kinds that present differently but sometimes im overcome with guilt because i feel like im giving people the wrong idea about it i show up to work i leave the house frequently i have no fear of driving or talking to strangers or being in public i wake up and get chores done i have plenty of hobbies i laugh and smile and joke around a lot i genuinely enjoy things i reach out to people easily and others would probably say im full of life energetic and cheerful so how do i explain the nights where i stay up crying because i suddenly feel like i cant breathe properly and my heart rates at 140 how do i explain that i absolutely sit still frozen in fear trying to convince myself that im not dying or having a panic attack at various times throughout the day how do i explain the oximeter ive carried for years how do i explain that i get the inclination to tell everyone i love you because i feel like somethings completely wrong with my body thanks to a new pain in a new location that i cant explain so naturally that means im leaving soon how do i explain the countless trips to the er and urgent care in the last 3 years only for every blood work and ekg and whatever test they had to do appear normal but the fear lingers how do i explain that its an unfamiliar feeling to me being this frightened which makes it scarier how do i explain that i have days where i absolutely feel like im going insane because i cant recognize myself anymore how do i explain that yes im the perpetually idealistic fool who loves life still and can see the good side of everything and hey i might not even have it so bad compared to others but jesus fuck when it hits i absolutely feel like crumbling because i dont feel like my mind and body are mine and its scary worse how do i explain that im really only a mess when i have a panic attack but i never know when it might happen like yeah dude im chill and fun and funny even and can get things done until im not anymore because my body just went tense and panicstricken for no obvious reason its been 3 years since ive dealt with this a bad case of covid during the holidays at the height of it being a complete mystery and a badtraumatic accident the first two years the panic attacks were frequent and happened multiple times daily nobody got the chance to see me in my lowest because we were all keeping our distance i guess ive since started therapy and medication last year its manageable most days but its still terrifying and debilitating when it strikes im tired guys arent you yeah sorry just had a bad episode and the first thing that came to mind was being told i wouldve never guessed after i opened up about my diagnosis recently heh thanks for letting me vent,post-pandemic
a coworker told me that her daughter was learning to ride a bike the daughter is very afraid because she might fall yet its strange because she can do more complicated things like ice skating the only difference is that she loves ice skating and she hates riding a bike talking with that coworker we concluded that if she liked riding a bike she would learn even if shes afraid just like in many aspects of life ive been thinking that maybe it could be a solution for my social anxiety learning to feel passion for communication and meeting people according to a book i read to force yourself to feel passion for something what you have to do is research and read all the information you can about that topic passion comes from researching a topic,post-pandemic
hello friends title is self explanatory ive been talking to this girl going on 3 months now and she is so incredibly kind and patient and gentle with me she communicates really well she makes me feel safe she shows that she cares deeply about me and she reassures me she knows i have bpd i told her probably about a month in she said it didnt scare her and we talked about it more as things progressed and she has told me multiple times that she will be as patient as she needs to be because she knows im working on it but things happen and i will slip up from time to time and thats okay its not my fault its going really well and i really care about her and she really cares about me but im terrified im terrified that my bpd will ruin this just like its ruined everything else for me i can feel the self sabotaging urges and ive been able to fight them back so far but it just keeps getting worse the more i fall for her i talk about it with her and tell her whats going on in my mind and i make sure to reassure her that she is doing absolutely nothing wrong im just so utterly terrified that i will do something to fuck this up this is the first chance ive had at a healthy relationship she doesnt make me chase her or make me guess about her feelings for me like all my exes have how do i not ruin this im so scared,post-pandemic
smoking marijuana makes me manichypomanic not sure which is appropriate i love the periods of mania as music feels amazing i feel spiritual and alive im happy motivated and sociable but i wonder if my current depression is caused by the previous maniahypomania with tolerance after about six months i didnt get much of an effect from weed anymore and then winter came and it felt like an episode of seasonal depression which i am still dealing with today i guess because the depression didnt happen as soon as i stopped getting strong effects from weed and it happened when the days became very short and dark i am not sure if the depression was caused by the manic episode or not what id like to know is if anyone else becomes manic or hypomanic from weed and most importantly if they have a depressive episode after it if so is it every time i feel so good and happy when im manic with little negative consequences i dont destroy my life and relationships that its so hard for me to think that i might have to say goodbye to those feelings for ever but i might just have to i dont know if its worth the depression it doesnt help that i have barely enjoyed music for years now when i used to be a huge music fan it guts me would love to know about similar experiences,post-pandemic

so i dont even know if what im struggling with is adhd since i obviously havent been tested yet but hearing people talk about living with it has hit incredibly close to home so its enough that i need to get it confirmed the problem is that regardless of of what this is its pretty much crippled my ability to do anything due to inability to motivate myself to do things i need or want to do i spend so much time internally screaming at myself to do something and all that seems to do is make it worse this cost me my teens my 20s and half my 30s and i dont think its fair that i need to wait at least year and a half to just to maybe get told whether this is or isnt what im struggling with im obviously not going to find a solution to this on here but im hoping i can at least get directions to something to give me that boost so i can start actually functioning and take my life off of pause i figure even if this isnt adhd it seems to at least have some overlap with what some of you folk have so i can only hope someone here might be able to help sorry if this is a bit ranty i just came off the phone to my gp and i felt like he just rushed to getting to the end of the call maybe hes right in that theres nothing to be done until after i get test in at least a year and half but with how dismissive he was i wanted to make sure that was actually the case,post-pandemic

i want to get clean so badly i hate the constant cycle of being clean for a month or 2 and then going on a bender for 2 months then having to apologize to my family for being so mentally absent and all the pain ive caused while using always promising it wont happen again ive struggled with social anxiety for over 10 years when i discovered xanax i immediately fell in love with how it made me feel before i started abusing it i would think to myself like wow this is how it feels to not have anxiety it made me less scared of being out and feeling that spotlight effect and more socialless awkward it felt like it turned me into this version of myself ive always wanted to be but i have an addictive personality and eventually couldnt control my usage ive been to rehab twice but it was forced by family and a therapist so i didnt put in the actual work after too many blackouts and waking up in hospital beds because of family concern i got clean right when covid hit i work from home and am mainly alone all day so i get bored which is now the main reason i always relapse it feels like a hobby almost and honestly its just fun for me being sober is boring i cant take it in moderation i cant control myself no matter how many times i buy again and tell myself that this time will be different i have no self control i drain my bank account buying drugs when im using i just wanna go out and have a good time im always on the go making plans it makes me more confident to go on dating apps and meet people and just go out in general but i dont realize until after i stop that i wasnt being this cool version of myself that i thought i was i slur my words i say dumb shit and make so many typos while texting im reckless i go through my drugs so fast because of false sobriety more is never enough and the worst of it all is when i look back and can only remember fragments of the things i said and did when im on a bender my whole family knows it hurts them so much for them to see me that way when i stop using usually because i dont have enough money to buy stuff i snap back to reality and feel so ashamed and embarrassed of my actions after the initial regret and apologizing to everyone it doesnt take long for me to get so mind numbingly bored again and tell myself that itll be different this time i dont wanna be an addict anymore but that feeling of confidence i get on benzos has such a hold on me especially as i struggle badly with anxiety that feeling of actually having plans and going out and not just sitting at home is so tempting im fucking lazy and dont wanna do anything when im sober but this last bender i crashed my car and that was kind of a wake up call that im not invincible and can actually cause real damage i have an intake appointment next week for an outpatient rehab program im going but im just scared and tired of the grip this drug has on my life thats all thank you for reading,post-pandemic

i want to preface this with i feel horribly about it and was completely out of line i 24f took my toddler 3m old to sunday school without my husband 30m so he could have time without the toddler bc hes been with him the last two weeks nonstop due to being sick and not able to go to daycare till this week that went fine while we were gone i was going to stop at the bank to pull money out because were moving soon and surprise surprise no debit card so im trying to keep myself from melting down thinking its in my purse and ill look when i get to the atm well after sitting at the light through three cycles where the left lane was skipped i get to the bank and 1 cant find the card 2 the fucking atm isnt there cause i guess theyre closing that location so i called my husband to vent bc it feels like everything that can go wrong has been going wrong recently and i start spiraling on the phone and while trying to calm me down he mentions that its irritating that ive been spiraling since im not able to afford my meds rn insurance lapsed until march so i went off because he also hasnt worked since getting fired from his job in october and i was like i feel like im not getting any help financially because xyz company isnt returning your calls and you wont do any work besides x job which only leaves three options for you to work at and he started ranting and crying about how he was getting all the packing done while i had our kid out of the house which i had previously thanked him for and before being more or less incoherently upset so i fucking screamed at him thats its not about him its not his fault nothing is ever his fault and its my fault for fucking up and not doing enough constantly not gonna lie though i feel terrible but i wanted to say much more hurtful shit,post-pandemic

even on subreddits like raskdocs seldom does an actual doctor that specializes in your conditions illness post most often it is grade schoolers high schoolers and god forbid premed students playing dr house in some cases youll get med students but they arent doctors either i fell into a 3 month long depression because i posted on raskdocs on my throwaway for me it was a red patch on my tongue with some white in and around it i posted a picture of it and everyone diagnosed it as you know what i am not surprised if you google this you will see the only possible conditions are what you would expect c word when i went to see the doctor he laughed at the notion of it being that and immediately diagnosed me with stomach issues he saw the evidence of acid reflux in my mouth and referred me to a gi specialist i made some life style changes quit smoking stopped drinking juice at night made sure to eat no less than 3 hours before sleeping etc within a few months all evidence of that illness in my mouth went away not a single person in my thread mentioned anything about gi issues even google provided no hits for gi issues which is probably why no one said anything since all people do on reddit is just google your symptoms and read back the same shit you read and frightened yourself with the only issue that came up that wasnt the c word was geographic tongue but my doctor says this is very often misdiagnosed especially in people with gi issues andor on antibiotics once i started looking into gi issues and how it manifests on the tongue i found many people talking about their strange tongues and even finally found a person who posted a pic of their tongue that looked just like mine on one of the gi issue subreddits no less and he was also diagnosed with gi issues hours and weeks of research never once revealed this benign condition that i had if it had i would have immediately known because i had been waking up with stomach pain every day for the better part of a year had even awoken in the middle of the night a few times with what i thought was vomit in my mouth it was acid from acid reflux and constantly was using the washroom 5x a day,post-pandemic
i need advice on a fear of intimacy problem and a lack of self worth because of rejection traumas 21 male for age and gender context for context you can look at my profile when i met a girl in r dating advice i thought about it the past days and i realised because of past trauma from girls rejecting me my head was full with she is taller then me she probably doesnt like me i shouldnt risk it i like this person and dont want to ruin the relationship we are probably too different she has i dinamic life and i dont i just realised she wanted to kiss me and i accidentally rejected her because i wanted to tell her something forgot her number because i was given fake profiles or even just ghosted one time a girl just grabbed my phone gave me her profile and ghosted me i dont know why no words i dont really have any dating experience never kissed or done more it doesnt really bother me i dont really care but it does contribute when i like someone having anxiety all the girls i like where either taken and the ones that liked me i rejected causing this sort of not missing out but what if feeling i have a lot of regrets because of that but because of this realisation i dont really regret meeting that girl she helped me even if i dont ever see her again she was just nice my first valentine that nothing happened is my best,post-pandemic
i havent had a health anxiety episode in a while but i think im starting to feel the beginning of one i can tell my mind is trying to find something to latch on eg my fianc has an acne spot on his back and i felt this dread creep in like a mist logically i know its just acne but i started contemplating worst case scenario i managed to forget about it but earlier i was washing my hair in preparation for a hair mask and noticed my hair to be very thin instantly i started inspecting my head and i contemplated counting all the hair that came out of my brush after my shower which is a little insane of me so im not concerned about a specific condition its more generalized but i can tell its just the calm before the storm is there a way to avoid it or is this inevitable i know why im anxious tomorrow i have orientation on campus to start the masters program at a prestigious university even though ive gotten both my undergraduate degrees from this same university for some reason i dont feel like im smart enough to be there the program is notoriously difficult to get into but im convinced i just got in by luck what do you do when you feel an episode coming on,post-pandemic

i feel like i am slowly breaking down my closest relationships with my emotions ill feel a certain way like jealous abandoned hurt and be afraid to express this to my friends mostly because i think its not rooted in true realitybut it feels so real so ill try and manage it by myself with my therapist but often itll build up and eventually ill lash out at my friendsto differing degrees at first i think my friends were just surprised by this behavior but as time goes on i worry theyll lose tolerance for being hurt by me and say its just too much but to me these feelings are so real i feel really hurt so instead do i just sit in my resentments can anyone relate have any reassurance advice,post-pandemic
when people say certain things to me or i overhear them or when people look at me like i could just be playing a video game and someone in the house looks at me is it odd that it kinda triggers a mini episode where i starting hearing things in my head mostly negative thing like i was talking to my cousin he came back from college and i asked him if he was going back and he said hes going to his girlfriends house and i told him have a good time then i started hearing things in my own head and thoughts were becoming more irrational and paranoid like being alone people talking about me etc idk if thats psychosis or what cause i still dont really understand when the schizophrenic symptoms erupt unless its full blown,post-pandemic

this is unbelievable my gf has been having a horrible 3 month long episode of health anxiety searching online on youtube all that stuff so recently i stumbled upon on some article about recommendation algorithms suggesting to the user not only the subject of interest but in case of medical issues the doomsday version of it to the point finding neutral articles becomes a challenge i guess it does make sense but its difficult to stay sane during an episode so keep that in mind,post-pandemic

ive been best friends with this girl for around 7 years and in 2019 she was struggling with bulimia pretty badly and for a long time i was the only one who knew of her disorder back then i was also clueless about how to help her because she refused to accept she had a problem and it became a really sensitive topic between us but by the end of 2019 she had told her mother everything and began recovery although we never really spoke about it either which was going well for her of course i dont know what she did behind closed doors but as i have struggled and am still struggling with an eating disorder myself i didnt see any signs that she was still actively engaging in her ed like i used to before and she seemed also physically healthier that was until around septemberoctober of 2023 when she started talking about her weightbody again and how she wanted to lose weight we were out eating once and after eating she went to the bathroom took a long time and came back with bloodshot eyes and shaky hands i knew exactly that she had purged but i didnt want to believe it so i brushed it off and i also didnt know if i should talk to her about it especially since we were in public over the course of the last months she visibly lost weight and in december she even specifically told me and asked me to guess how much she lost but i refused since i didnt want to fuel her ed i also never comment on her body or weight loss in any way because i know from my ed how triggering even small remarks can be and she told me she lost 18kg in the last 3 months later that day we were at a party and when she was already pretty drunk she kept talking about her body and told me what her ultimate goal weight those exact words too which is a common phrase in ed spaces is this was what confirmed for me that she had relapsed she also keeps reposting tiktoks that are about weight and starving yourself on her alt account which i think she forgot that i follow i want to help her but i dont know how she is very sensitive when i bring up her history with bulimia and in the past always shut down any concern i considered confiding in a common friend we have but i think that would be a really shitty thing to do to her and if she was to talk to someone about my ed with someone id feel very hurt too so i most likely wont do that but i cant keep this to my self much longer mostly because i know that shes suffering and im literally doing nothing to help her what should i do i know i should talk to her and that i know her best but i really have no clue how to even bring it up,post-pandemic
i have had anxiety for my whole life and bad health anxiety for three years i have had therapy a number of times and it always feels like the only advice they can give me is various distraction techniques either grounding type exercises or doing things i love so i dont think about ha so much this feels inadequate to me as a way to tackle severe health anxiety can anyone weigh in,post-pandemic

i should note i did stop taking my lamictal a couple days ago bla bla bla i know prior to taking it i was never even that bad my doctor was hesitant to even put me on it i dont have a history of intense bipolar behavior the diagnosis itself is debated anyways today someone at work paged me to call them and put their number on the page to dial i call them no answer i send them a chat on teams later a co worker comes to me and goes have you finished with client xyz i said no because jane told me to call her before we talked to that client my coworker was confused cus we all use the same pager number and he never got that message i go to pull it up on mine and i dont see it on the pager im like wait i swear it was here i look at other peoples pagers it doesnt exist but it had very specific instructions to not engage with that client before i call her im starting to feel crazy so i look at my phone log and it says at 110pm i dialed out to her i would only have called her like if she sent me a page to do so because i do not have her number otherwise so to me im thinking obviously i did get a page because theres no other way id have found and dialed her number i go to her office a few hours later and shes like i saw your message on teams sorry i was out of office i say did you page me to talk to you about clientx and she goes no so when i get back to my own office i look at the call log again the 110 call is not on record anymore i am a very frazzled and forgetful person and i mix things up a lot but this felt different i had such a clear memory of the page what it said and of seeing my recorded call at 110 all gone and its scary cus it actually affected my work i didnt call a client and i told a co worker a made up reason why i have zero history of delusions nothing even close is this a withdrawal thing its scary how real it felt pls spare me the take your medsnonsense theres nuance to this situation,post-pandemic

im currently addicted to weed this is not a very difficult addiction to live with since i dont experience physical symptoms of withdrawal at all what makes me come back to weed every time is just a mental desire that i cant resist my life is miserable bpd heavy childhood trauma and thc definitely doesnt help i have always identified as an intelligent person and it terrifies me to se myself progressively get more and more stupid and lazy i went to psychologist she refused to give me help unless i go to rehab she didnt seem very competent but im not able to find a better psychologist since she was the only option covered by my insurance and i cant afford private therapy i feel like a meeting with a good specialist once a week would be enough to help me kick this strictly behavioural addiction but i cant get it i identify more as an politoxicomaniac than thc addict since ive done plenty of substances in the past and loved almost all of them even though my use had terrible consequences i also come from a long line of addicts everyone in my family was addicted never done opiates tho since i realise that its too easy to get into physical dependence and i was always scared of it not anymore rehab seems like the only way to go since i wanna live a substancefree life but i just cant do it but i dont wanna go to rehab simply because i smoke too much weed it just seems dumb i feel like i need to become a proper addict first one who experiences physical wd symptoms and also one who go to experience a really good time before getting clean im gonna sign up for rehab wait some time for a place in one and during that waiting period have some amazing time on opiates why not if im gonna end up on rehab anyway this might be my addicted brain talking im gonna get sober i only need to get fucked first opiate addiction might me more difficult to kick than weed addiction but if rehab is my only option of getting any kind of help then i might as well go there more addicted than i already am,post-pandemic
okay so basically ive been having hearth palpitations for 3 years now everything started when i was 17 few years ago i decided to visit hearth doctor which did all the exams and said that im fine theres nothing to be worried about theres no risk for anything bad to happen which doesnt seem 100 sure to me my current health or idk how should i say it i feel anxious 247 like wtf i dont feel like anything that i do that stresses me but i just have that feeling that something is wrong with me 100 my family doctor is also tired of me always complaining about my hearth for the last 3 years nevertheless she started to tell me that its just anxiety and she says that every time i ask what should i do about those palpitations she just keeps bragging that i should stay calm exercise etc few months ago i went to her again and asked should i go to a psychologist which she agreed with me long story short went to psychologist she said i should try doing some breathing exercises well okay 2 months passed nothing helped and im thinking right now theres one weird thing with me like i dont believe that breathing could help me which my doctor says differently everything is in our mind but the thing is when doctor told me to do those exercises i was 100 sure they wont which is just like i said now do you guys have the same thing like someone tells that it will work but you think about 1000 different possibilities like for example some people believe in god right well they always brag about how their health started to be better after they started to believe in him and they also have more energy etc well me being 1000iq i always say to myself example you only feel better because you believe that god exists and then i just cant believe in god just simply becausei always think that its just in your brain and that god doesnt exist its only your imagination which makes you feel better because you believe that god exists or in any other thing like i always think that im ahead of people 100 times and they dont understand what im trying to say does anyone understand what im talking about i dont know what should i do where should i go this is just making me crazy please help people,post-pandemic
i decided to finally quit drinking after years of getting drunk either with friends or by myself my poor wife had to suffer because of me and i cant continue to hurt her i did not drink every day or even every weekend but at least twice a month i would start drinking beer late in the evening usually while fishing on my boat by myself and would not stop until like 5 or 6 in the morning i usually would start drinking on my boat and would continue to drink after trailering my boat out of the marina on the way home i would stop at gas stations to buy even more beer and continue to drink and drive after cleaning my boat i would get back in my truck and continue to drink beer driving back and forth to the gas station for more beer until 5 or 6 in the morning the only reason i would even stop is because my wife would wake up around that time and catch me i was not an emotional drunk i was just a happy drunk jamming out to classic rock in my truck drinking by myself i know i had to stop because i was risking my career by drinking and driving and because i was making my poor wife suffer but ever since a stopped about a week ago ive been super anxious and depressed i dont think its withdrawals because i didnt drink everyday and i would be able to go even two weeks without getting wasted i think its simply knowing that i can never get wasted again or even socially drink i was able to do that without getting wasted it fucking sucks and it honestly feels like i have a heavy heart as if i lost someone and i cant stop thinking about the fact that i cant drink anymore im feeling very depressed have any of you recovered alcoholics experienced what im feeling when they first stopped if so does it go away,post-pandemic

as i wake up each morning im engulfed by an overwhelming sense of emptiness and detachment from the world around me its as though im trapped in a perpetual twilight zone neither fully alive nor completely dead i am convinced beyond any doubt that i have passed away and now exist in a state of purgatory every reflection in the mirror only reinforces my conviction the face staring back at me appears pale and lifeless devoid of vitality or warmth i feel like a ghost haunting the corridors of my own existence disconnected from the vibrant pulse of life that once coursed through my veins simple tasks become monumental challenges as i struggle to find purpose or meaning in this liminal existence why bother eating sleeping or interacting with others when i am but a specter condemned to wander aimlessly in this purgatorial realm even the most mundane experiences take on a surreal quality as though i am witnessing the world through a haze of unreality colors seem muted sounds distant and time itself stretches and distorts in strange ways despite the despair that grips my soul there is a curious comfort in the certainty of my condition in this purgatory of the mind there are no more uncertainties or anxieties about the future i am free from the burdens of mortal existence liberated from the constraints of time and space yet even as i cling to this newfound certainty a flicker of doubt gnaws at the edges of my consciousness what if i am wrong what if this purgatory is merely a delusion a trick of my fractured mind but such thoughts are quickly dismissed drowned out by the relentless tide of conviction that washes over me with each passing moment for in this twilight world of shadows and echoes i am certain of only one thing that i am dead and this is my purgatory,post-pandemic

i believe it is only right that i describe the nature and everything that has lead up to this moment my girlfriend and i met each other roughly 8 months ago and have been dating for just a little over 5 months we have had our ups and downs weve struggled a bunch because of her past trauma which has caused her to have many mental issues but that has not deterred me the least she has opened up to me a lot and told me a lot of stories from her past that she has not told anyone else this naturally affected me and caused me to open up and i thought that it would be safe for me to tell her about my deepest trauma and secret when i was roughly 9 years old i was raped by my older brother he had manipulated me and brainwashed me into thinking that what was happening was okay and just a normal family thing this stayed fresh on my mind for the next two years and when i was roughly 11 years old i almost did the same thing to a younger sibling i stopped myself since i realised that something was not right something was not okay i didnt really know whether it was right or wrong at the time but it just felt off to me over the next few years i had mostly forgotten these two things but when i became 1516 and started learning more about sex and etc i learnt that this was definitely not okay every day since i learnt that and undid the brainwashing i have hated myself been filled with so much disgust and suicidal thoughts whenever i recall it all i have not had any thoughts like that since i was 11 i told her all of this but due to her past trauma and a similar thing happening to her when she was a child she has been extremely torn apart she says she doesnt trust me when i tell her i am not like that she was filled with disgust hatred that i was like the men who abused her in her childhood she has told me she does not love me that i have ruined love for her for the rest of her life and that even if we stayed together she would have no loyalty to me and would not be attracted to me whatsoever she was my angel she changed my life around completely right before i met her i was extremely depressed suicidal and all of that from having lived a miserable 19 years before meeting her and it all completely changed when i met her my life was on a new course i was reaching new heights with her constantly but now it all feels like its about to go away it feels like its all over i have written a suicide note already and plan on killing myself if i do not manage to fix this she lives in america and i live in the uk so ive bought an emergency flight to see her in a few days i dont know what i can do is there any advice that can even be given in this situation we loved each other so much we were perfect for each other we made each other the happiest we have ever been throughout our fucked up lives and now it all feels like its about to go how can i fix this relationship how can i help her trust me,post-pandemic
tw infidelity sh abuse suicidality i used to be healthily attached though bordering on avoidant with some mild mental problems ed depression and anxiety however in september of last year i found out that my bf of 2 years that i had a perfect relationship with cheated for the entire relationship virtually by being on dating apps and being on onlyfans this traumatized me to such an extent that i think i may have developed bpd i have only ever heard of bpd being caused by severe or childhood trauma which i dont have so i dont know if im exaggerating you can see the details of the past few months in my post history but ill reiterate the main points im extremely anxiously attached to my cheating boyfriend but avoiding everyone else i regularly spiral out of nowhere ive started self harming i had hit myself a few times as a teenager but started cutting only recently ive hit my boyfriend several times had never even wanted to hit anyone before in my life ive started smoking weed and tried nicotine for the first time recently im now an alcoholic i go walking at night for fun in dangerous areas im suicidal im extremely manipulative im paranoid and have experienced delusions when especially angry i have even had murderous urges towards my boyfriend i was never a 100 healthy person mentally but this is completely unsustainable i know people with a bpd diagnosis who havent gone as far as me i dont understand whats wrong with me,post-pandemic

sometimes i look at the amount of people i contacted throughout my life and im feeling overwhelmed by the amount of friendships and relationships that i wanted to have or could have but which never happened because of my social anxiety and other mental problems but i think sa is a primary reason here i tried my best and more or less talked to lots of people in school university 5 workplaces but i didnt end up being friends or making any meaningful connection with any of them except my husband but we have our struggles too there were some mutually beneficial relationships in school and university that ended right away after graduation but thats it in a few months i will be having my 30th birthday and the fact that ill probably wont celebrate at all or get any congratulation message from anybody pretty much sums up my life so far very often i feel like a ghost thats floating around the planet and never touches any living soul until it completely disappears without a trace,post-pandemic

hello all i just started lamictal again at 25mg per day after being off it for months at the recommendation of my psychiatrist she took me off it because i was having rage issues on it but off it i was a complete mess having panic attacks and breakdowns and there are no other medications she recommended she suggested i might have bipolar 2 im not sure if that counts as an official diagnosis but it seems fitting anyway ive been wondering how am i supposed to feel day to day when i was on abilify i felt numb with my emotions tamped down unable to cry ever and in retrospect it seems i was lobotomized and sedated when i was not on any meds i was somewhat catatonic but also agitated and online about 16 hours a day when i first went to my current psychiatrist last july she put me on latuda which allowed me to be productive but at the same time i felt maybe hypomanic my thoughts were always racing and i wanted to talk or text people 247 it also made my feet swell up like crazy so i had to go off it so i switched to lamictal my psychiatrist only titrated up to 50 mg over the course of four months i would notice it having a positive effect the first two days or so i started it or the first day of a new dose but after that it didnt seem to have any noticeable effect i was raging at people and having a great deal of anxiety so she decided to switch me to just buspirone for anxiety with gabapentin which makes me literally high and makes me stay up all night and hydroxyzine in case i have a panic attack which i dont think actually works for that purpose when i was just taking buspirone these past few months for anxiety i had insane anxiety a depressive episode and sleep problems and other symptoms that seemed like possible hypomania i had a weeks long depressive episode in january where i stopped going to work followed by what felt like agitated depression where i was unable to sleep through the night then i would be exhausted and one time i fell asleep in a study room at my school and had to go home and miss my 630 pm class so im just wonderinghow am i supposed to feel am i raging and spiraling because im not suited to lamictal or am i just not depressed anymore and realizing there are a lot of things i dont like about my life that ive put up with for a long time that i want to change how do normal people feel how does a properly medicated bipolar 2 person feel i am also on ozempic im not sure what psychotropic effects that has if any but it changes how your body absorbs meds plus i cant do any comfort eating while on it or eat a lot to manage my insomnia so being on it has definitely made me an anxious mess but i dont blame the medication itself the other thing im wondering is is it always obvious when youre hallucinating i have depersonalizationderealization issues and i live in one of the biggest cities in the us so i see weird shit every day and nothing really feels real last spring i was having this feeling like bugs were crawling all over my body and i went to a neurologist for a peripheral nerve test which they said was normal then that randomly stopped happening last fall but when i lie in bed at night i feel like the bed is shaking this has happened at two different apartments with two different beds and even happened when i first moved to my current apartment and was sleeping on a mattress on the floor at my old apartment it would feel like my roommates cat jumped on the bed but then i would look and he wasnt even in the room ive looked up possible causes for this and one of them is vertigo which im getting tested for next week but im just wondering if these are hallucinations how do i figure that out also are there other things that go into psychosis like one time a few years ago before i ever went on any bipolar meds and was unmedicated i had an episode and didnt leave my apartment for about two weeks but i couldnt sense time passing and two weeks felt like two days i was shocked when i saw what day it was also at that time i felt like i was above my body and went back into my body where i previously wasnt for like a decade if that makes sense so im wondering if this sort of time compression or feeling outside your body is a feature of psychosis or like having rage and feeling like you blacked out but you are sober the whole time im looking for insight because i havent felt happy or like a real person in years maybe ever and i would like to i would like to have a good life i would like to be able to think and pursue my interests without constantly spiraling the emotion i mainly feel is rage at any moment im either silently boiling over with suppressed rage or crying i dont let myself feel sadness i dont think because im afraid if i do that it will be endless and im afraid of what will happen but i dont want to feel numb either,post-pandemic
i just want to go to the mountains and scream my lungs out i will never make the mistake of stopping my meds midway through treatment please dont stop taking your meds at your own will or just because a loved one told you to try your hardest to stay on meds and listen to what your psychiatrist says my parents ridiculed me the whole time i was home for the holidays saying that im an addict and that i have nothing wrong with all the while saying that im just an ungrateful kid who is wasting money and that my therapist is just exacerbating my mental health issues sure enough i let this shit get to me and never tried to get a followup appointment and within 4 days of my meds getting over i could feel myself deteriorate the suicidal thoughts came back with so many other things my meds were holding back from me when i told this to my parents they suggested i should just focus on my work sleep on time and drink water i tried to get an appointment but it took 3 weeks for them to set me up with my doctor i feel so pathetic for actually listening to the same people who actively ruined my mental health and selfesteem the same people who ridiculed me when i had depression in 2021 to them it doesnt matter i feel alone living in a new city heck i have an aunt im very close with but im not allowed to see her because im supposed to spend my time doing my online courses i told my dad about me finally getting an appointment and he just called me to force me to take homeopathic meds along with my psych meds is he a doctor no i just hope i dont have to start from square one and try out new meds again i really cant afford to have negative side effects ive already spent this whole week struggling to be even a little productive with my work and household chores man,post-pandemic

so none of you may have seen me post here as im quite new but im in some need of advice first though im going to give some background on how i was diagnosed and why i joined this subreddit first off how it all started and when i was eventually diagnosed it all started when i was 16 i dont remember what year as im not good with time but im 19 now anyways when i was 16 we had quite a year on top of past trauma i had already been dealing with at the time my family and i went through a house fire after which all the progress i had made on my mental health up to that point had floped it was mind shattering for me almost like a flip getting switched in my brain i had went from losing almost everything to losing everything i became slow zoned out and i often found myself overthinking more and more over time just sliding back down not able to stop myself the next year was pure chaos i had just recently been working on myself keeping my room clean showering just doing basic requirements to live but after the house fire its like it all slowly but surely came to a halt i started forgetting or entirely pushing it off started to hide in my room dropped out of school as it felt like everyone at school was talking about me or thinking negatively about me in their head if they would look my way almost as if i would talk for them and i just started becoming i dont even know what i often would get mad at my own family as i would think they were talking about me behind closed doors i would burst into rooms if i thought i heard my name sometimes i would hear my name in conversations that werent even about me and then on top of it all it seemed like people wouldnt understand what i was saying sometimes and i myself would have no idea where the topic had gone i would go from talking about what i did that day to how our dog chewy died a long time ago and then go straight to talking about getting my motorcycle license and then after all that talking just walk away to my room where i would sit there listening to music for hours on end while picking at my fingernails or the floor or staring at the ceiling i started to chip away at my relationships with family and my at the time girlfriend and then even more happened my girlfriend at the time decided to press the off switch on herself i sank further into what i assumed to be at the time depression but not much changed i just became a recluse in my room but my relationships continued to deteriorate as i could barely hold a job going on my 18th birthday i cant really remember much as i was in what i would call a mentalcoma at the time cant ever really remember much actually but anyways now to how i got to the diagnosis so i moved up to nebraska in october after my 19th birthday with a few random friends i was deep into whatever this mental illness caused i moved because i thought my family was financially abusing me even though they obviously werent so i just packed and took a train the next week i got a job up in nebraska but was deteriorating the relationships i had up there as well as i couldnt think about anyone but myself i would also tell my upstairs neighbor when i would go to hangout with him that my roommates hated me and were threatening to kick me out even though the things said by them werent even remotely close to what they probably said eventually i just ran i thought i was getting kicked out one night after one of them yelled at me for letting our upstairs neighbor my friend into the apartment without their permission and that same friend was going to take me back home to my family my mom agreed to it and not even 30 minutes into heading back she calls me and says the words yohr sisters dont want you back here i freaked out and panicked i dont even remember the situation very clearly but i know that i ended up at a mental health facility after my friend said i probably needed it so i admitted myself and spoke with the psychiatrist the next couple of weeks trying to figure out why i was empty isolative erratic and so on and as well as me speaking to the psychiatrist the psychiatrist was speaking to my roommate that i added as a emergency contact and release of information as well as my mother they explained a lot of what i couldnt and i dont know how they came to the decision but i was diagnosed with schizophrenia still dont know how or why im just confused really and im hoping someone with somewhat similar experiences could offer advice or explain how to handle it and mend the bridges ive burned because of my paranoia in all honesty i dont know what exactly im expecting to get out of this i think i just needed to get it out,post-pandemic
i spend my days locked in my room on my phone probably 14 hours a day just switching between the same few apps not even talking to anyone lately ive been buying a bunch of stuff to distract myself from how lonely i feel but in the end its just wasting the little money i have and wont give me connection like i need i dont even have a source of income only savings im so sick of being ugly and weird and stupid but atleast in isolation nobody has to look at me and i cant embarrass myself i remember in 2020 when everyone was going bonkers because they couldnt see each other like thats just my life if they had to live it theyd probably kill themself only reason i havent yet is fear they dont even know how lucky they are to have a social circle even if theyre not in a relationship not only do i not have a boyfriend i have no interaction with other women which is just as depressing and isolating i cry sometimes when i see girls hanging out together online i dont even care about sex anymore id die to just be pretty enough to be with a guy i love and have any amount of hope for the future i cant drive im broke dont go to school live at home everything in the book if i was normal and properly socialized i couldve accomplished so many things by now but i wont be ill always be behind everyone my age i cant stand going outside and seeing everyone together smiling and better than me so not exactly by choice but thats why i stay in my room all day,post-pandemic
hey fellas im f22 diagnosed with bpd depression and anxiety i was told by my psychiatrist that she also suspected adhd and bipolar im a big introvert who gets easily overstimulated and irritated even people around me just existing frustrates the living shit out of me at times i dontcant keep friends ive partied once or twice in my life and i regretted even trying i invest the majority of my money so that i have access to rather smaller amounts only im a great student and a loyal af partner in a long term 2 year relationship i live alone and i enjoy my own company as its easier to regulate myself and there are no consequences for anyone else when i cant but every now and then i get this overwhelmingly strong impulse to do something ill regret later spend money on shit stuff meet and do things with a hot guy basically cheat go partyingraving and get absolutely wasted or saydo something i cant take back thanks to my nature introverted and loyal to the extent that i feel like i cheated for smiling back at a random guy on a walk out of kindness lol and the precautions i take mostly financially that will not allow me to do those things at such times i dont get to act on them instead i get a new tattoo or a piercing or buy clothes that i neither feel comfortable wearing at normal times nor attend occasions i can wear them at im trying to figure out if this urge belongs to my diagnosed bpd or suspected bipolar there are other times when i feel ecstatic and very confident i have low selfesteem i dont give a f about what others think and im simply on cloud nine for nothing due to extreme positive emotionality that resembles more of a manic episode to me but this urge i explained above i cant understand if its bpd or bipolar like because its not positive emotionality but very high frustration knowing i cant act on them for obvious reasons what do you think can you relate if so how do you control it,post-pandemic
so in papers interview with psychiatrists and educators and even here mostly the experience being 2e is described as giftedness masking the disability as in the giftedness helps one do well in school despite the disability and thus the disability goes unnoticed until many years later i wonder if it can also be the other way around as in a adhd or a learning disability severe enough that it masks the giftedness until we learn to properly manage it in adulthood for example i know of 2 people who told me an eerily similar story even though they were incredibly smart they had difficulty in school diagnosed as having profound adhd multiple professionals remarked that they show many traits of giftedness they took the test and the result came back as notgifted one even took the test again a few years later only when reaching adulthood and learning to manage their adhd did they start truly excelling were constantly getting high grades in college and are both now having a successful academic career are you reverse twice exceptional or do you know someone who is id love to hear your experiences,post-pandemic

a friend of mine recently died after having been a secret highfunctioning alcoholic their liver failed and they wouldnt get a transplant because of answers they had provided to their doctor during a previous visit i was shocked that i never had noticed that they were an alcoholic despite having been on multiple vacations together this prompted me to look into alcoholism and try to understand it better i myself on average have maybe one drink per week despite having a small mezcal and whiskey collection but this experience still left me much more suspect of any alcohol consumption on a recent allinclusive vacation this promoted me to not drink any alcohol every few days despite my friends drinking every day because we are on vacation and its free now to my concern my dead friends spouse who supposedly didnt know about their spouses alcoholism either seems to have a unchanged relationship with alcohol they were on vacation with us and drank 3 drinks every day when i mentioned that im having a dry day to stay safe they said theyd do that after our vacation even though their drinking wasnt even part of the discussion this came off as unnesecerily defensive to me one time my spouse and i ran into this friend while they were on their way to get a drink on their own even though they new that everyone else was hanging out and had invited them no concern about wanting some alone time but that that time was spent getting a fancy drink made me think twice my friend does these allinclusive vacations every other month or so for 1 week im not sure how much they drink at home but whenever we visit wine gets opened but its the combination of what i perceive as fairly high drinking with the fact that i cannot see any change in behavior or even how they talk about alcohol after they spouse died from it that has me really worried my spouse and i have had alcoholism and new things we learned about it pop into our minds with some regulatory since the passing of our good friend my spouse in particular has spent countless hours talking with our surviving friend about their loss but the alcoholism itself was never much discussed by our friend id have excpected them to be more suspect of alcohol than we are but that doesnt seem the case at all their new partner voiced concern in private that they sometimes say they cannot sleep and take a shot to address it this seems crazy to me all this leaves me worried that my surviving friend is addicted themselves and its trying to hide it as well or is lying to themselves or worse knew about their spouses alcoholism all along but were happy being alcoholics together am i overreacting since i never was much of a drinker if not is there anything i can do to help not lose this friend to alcohol as well,post-pandemic
will probably delete later i feel out of control again its so bad so bad so bad its worse than yesterday and the day before that i just feel so spiteful towards the people who love me and i hate myself for it they dont mean to but everything is triggering me beyond belief the stupidest most insignificant things like misspeaking or not doing something i was told wed do together is sending me into a downward spiral it doesnt feel like im in a drivers seat it feels like im possessed like theres something evil in my body pushing me towards the most destructive responses i know its just me and im responsible for it all but i dont know how to calm down i need my medication and my prescriber has yet to reply i dont know how i was living without chemical help because off it im absolutely pulsating with a sickness in my body i need out the most important person in my life right now is not in a place to help me and i dont want to crash into him anymore than i already have with how sensitive and toxic i am right now i dont mean to push him away im just stuck back in the delusion that everyone hates me persecutory thoughts are the fucking worst i know i shouldnt speak to him and wont i just dont want to be alone i dont know what i need i have an idea what i need to do but i dont know how to deal with intense splitting im blanking,post-pandemic
my partner is a fairly closed off person and i am a bit awkward in finding my words which makes it difficult to approach the depression i know he has been facing i also think the stigma of being seen as a closed off person makes it more difficult for him to break the norm and open up every once in a while a conversation about it will open my heart hurts for him he is so hard on himself which leads to self sabotage which is just a vicious cycle he has expressed that he cant really feel happiness anymore he feels like he should be further along in life than he is hes been having late night panic attacks and he suffers through them alone instead of waking me hes a pretty old school masculine male so i think getting to the point of unpacking the things and emotions that have led to this state is going to be a real journey but entirely possible and he does have a support system who loves him if hell be open about talking and accepting help he does not want to see a dr or get on medication which i understand but is open to finding help in other places we are both heavy drinkers but we dont get stupid when we drink so its easy for us to brush off but i know its a problem and think that the long term affects of alcohol have messed with his dopamine as well i know who he is and i see him on a deep level for the kind caring generous and loving person that he is and all the surface and status crap doesnt mean anything to me i am looking for advice on the best way to support him and encourage healing and progress without overbearing or burning him out or making him feel like hes doing it for me what are little things i can saydoencourage to show him that i am a safe space and that he doesnt need to put on a show for me how can i help him get the help he deserves i wish he could see himself through my eyes and i wish i could just hug all the negative emotions away but i cant and i need a starting place for us to foster healing we are going to attend aa and try to find a community so he and i can talk to other people as well but id like some advice on what i can do on the home front to make sure he knows he is loved and appreciated and to try to help him love and appreciate himself,post-pandemic

i am almost 21 years old and i have been smoking marijuana every day multiple times a day for the last 6 years as i started i used it as a way to cope with familial issues and the stresses of my life and then my life got worse because it made me lazy unmotivated and gave me terrible social anxiety so i lost friends quit sports and hobbies and failed in school so i smoked more and more and more as my life deteriorated and i became depressed anxious suicidal and just all around miserable for 6 years i lost touch with everything that truly mattered to me all i did was smoke weed and every single day i would try to get myself to stop smoking because i knew it was ruining my life and i hated my life but i never could stop this is my 42nd day off the ganja which is the longest ive gone since i started 6 years ago it has been going well i have been doing well in school i am taking 5 classes i have good grades good relationships with teachers i got a job as a waiter i have plans for my future and i am much more social however things still arent all that great i am still pretty depressed i still am not going to the gym like i want to and a lot of other thing are still not going as i would like i am sure it takes more than 40 days and that in a year i will be even better but it is getting very hard i am still no where near the mental head space i was before i smoked however it is evident that things are better the first 35 or so days i didnt really crave it at all it was just hard to deal with reality and face my problems instead of escaping with weed i was sweating all day every day from all parts of my body and irritable the first week but other than that nothing else really as i got to day 40 i began craving weed putting my jacket on to go to the dispensary and then taking it off and trying to convince myself to not go today i was pretty much ready to walk out the door and go buy a cartridge but i did not its just so hard to face my reality and where i am at in life but i know that smoking is the reason my life is the way it is and the only way to reverse it is to be sober and definitely not to smoke for that will only make it worse i am looking for words of encouragement motivation and anything pretty much from others who were in a similar place as me and stopped smoking to help me continue on this mission thanks guys,post-pandemic
christmas i passed out and embarrassed myself 2 days later i decided enough was enough and after 20 years of dedicated drunkenness i stopped drinking its been 47 days and ive been eating like a horse and drinking cases of iced tea and club soda regular seltzer i am actually finding the stop drinking subs depressing and anxiety inducing at the moment people much younger than me people who drank considerably less than me the health problems and relationship problems that i somehow avoided for now have been catching up to them i keep getting this feeling like even though i put the work in for the first time in my adult life that its still eventually going to catch up to me this maybe irrational feeling that it makes sense to give up and just succumb to the inevitable awful feeling so yeah i think im going to thank everyone for their support and tap out for a while o dont know,post-pandemic

so i used to drink occasionally while in the marines but now everytime i start to like someone or get attached i tend to drink heavy and everyday just to escape the feelings of having feelings i tend to drink a lot to mask how i feel about a person but still show them love weather is sober or not they never know im drunk or not im drunk as im typing this right now but it all starts when i start talking to someone or liking someone in general i feel like i do it just to avoid disappointment also if they were to ever leave me or neglect me in such a way i wouldnt have to deal with it because i feel numb i dont know i know i need help but im young 21m i any sound like a pussy but it doesnt matter,post-pandemic

really wish i could have given this any other flair but i am not doing well i have a big problem with both violence and inaction that i am not sure how to deal with i have suffered such intense moral injury from inaction that there was a point in my life where i swung waaaay too hard in the direction of vigilance it almost always ended up in people being physically hurt as well as confused as to why that hurt me in the other direction and now im neurotic in the direction of inaction all over again i feel like i have no other responses than retreat inward or go berserk ive gone over a decade without incident but there is a certain brand of disrespect that really makes me fear both for my response as well as the others physical safety i dont know how to navigate this i go far out of my way to set boundaries and let people know its not a joke and it seems like they take that communication as a sign that things are good enough that they can be totally casual about it i understand a lot of people respond this way when you give them everything up front but when i give the playbyplay commentary and things dont change i feel like im being actively disrespected in ways that make me physically ill i honestly dont know what to do it always seems as a rule you cant complain in a new situation off the first incident without outgrouping yourself it feels like i dont even notice until its too late and then i am i spying every little red flag i noticed on first encounter by memory but didnt have an urgent feeling about in this case the roommate who did the interview finding out i had a rent supplement and asking what my disability was in case it effects the house that shit is crazy and crazyunethical i could go on forever about that entitlement its really hard to even type out or think about but i feel so useless in nondangerous scenarios for a little while i considered what it might be like to just go get a job where people seem to get ptsd anyway like military or emergency room stuff i know i would be effective at least shortterm while the demons piled up but im way beyond that i would look like seth rogan taking his psych exam in observe and report probably the best hollywood depiction of a real mental illness without degrading the character i would say there is just no way any gatekeeper is going to by choice put someone with so much history in a position of responsibility so here i am in a new place shared house virtually choking from dehydration because i am afraid i might run into the person that is causing me problems after having repeated incidents for about a week little while ago he sold the only piece of furniture in my room online only told me when he needed help moving it im paying for this i am paying a thousand dollars a month to hide in a room and watch my personal projects i am working on monetizing go to waste it just makes no sense to me but if i dont try if i have nothing to work on things get bad so fast,post-pandemic

hope this doesnt come off as offensive to anyone sorry i tried quitting about 3 years ago admittingly i didnt look into every option but the ones i did and the two separate type of meetings i went to didnt appear to be religious on the surface but i soon found out were quite based around it im back to looking to quit again i know i cant do it by myself is religion a common thing for this is there something else i should be looking for besides typical aa meetings thank you,post-pandemic

i thought this whole one time drug usage experience for me was just on its way out but tonight ive been reminded that i might indeed have a problem and that people are just helping me not go full blown because they forced me to get rid of my pills without that who knows where wed be my roommate in college has a lot of prescription medications that i just saw on her desk one of them being adderall it seems suspicious though because theyre all full so she must not actually take them none of my business what she does with them but the point is the fact that the adderall is just sitting there was so tempting just to feel something the curiosity and urge was so strong but my mom told me i need to know youre safe and wont take anything stupid tonight and i made that promise rough night and reminded me that maybe i truly do have a problem not having the pills and being forced to flush them was both the most humiliating moment of my life and also made me very angry at myself to even be dabbling in those behaviors even if it was just one time one night one decision but all i can think about is my want for them again i want them back and thats the issue,post-pandemic

withdrawal question ive been a heavy drinker for around 10 years last year i got a blood test that showed high liver enzymes so went down to drinking one day a week no issues whatsoever in going cold turkey apart from cravings cut to christmas and i do a 6 days binge and get what i presume was mild withdrawal bad anxiety shakes and sweating took about a week until the anxiety calmed down but the other symptoms only lasted a few days i did dry january from 2612 0202 and drank friday and saturday that week not too bad bit of anxiety on the sunday but back to normal on the monday this past weekend i went out on saturday and hit it fairly hard drank from 12pm until 12pm and then had a few beers on the sunday afternoon woke up in the middle of the night and had a panic attack since then my anxiety has been sky high just about calming down today after having over a month off after two months cutting down but getting mild aws is a day or two drinking going to cause withdrawal now or are my hangovers just worse due to what ive done in the past,post-pandemic

i dont know how else to word the title so let me explain in text basically i work with my fp i told them once last year that i was interested in them romantically but after a short convo they turned me down gently and we agreed to just be friends ever since then i cant seem to stop thinking about them for long sometimes we would hang out together outside of work most often with at least one other coworker than the two of us i even pet sit for them when they went out of town despite being afraid of close proximity to animals lately ive been distancing myself and trying not to even look at them directly if we talk its mostly work related and if not i cut the conversation short and go find some task to do or something to clean at work im even trying to change my schedule to avoid working with them that much i recently told them that i had been having a hard time over the last year as part of an apology for being a bit too much on a particularly stressful day things were chaotic busy and we were definitely understaffed and overwhelmed that night and i got frustrated and started splitting and being passive aggressive i apologized for my behavior because i felt bad but now im wondering if i should have left out the part about having a hard time dealing with the feelings i have for them and the rejection from almost a year ago tldr is it worth trying to be transparent about struggling with unrequited romantic feelings for my fp a year after they rejected me or should i have just kept to myself like i had been doing,post-pandemic

in the depths of his psychosis andrews reality had become a labyrinth of twisted perceptions and delusions what began as fleeting moments of unease had evolved into a consuming conviction that he was no longer himself but rather a vessel for an otherworldly entity it started with whispers in the shadows faint echoes of a presence that seemed to lurk just beyond the edges of his consciousness at first andrew dismissed them as figments of his imagination fleeting remnants of his troubled mind but as the whispers grew louder and more insistent he could no longer deny their existence he became convinced that he was not alone in his own body that he shared his very being with an alien intelligence from a distant galaxy this entity he believed had chosen him as its host merging its consciousness with his own in a symbiotic union of minds as the days passed andrews behavior grew increasingly erratic as he struggled to come to terms with his newfound identity he would spend hours locked away in his room speaking in hushed tones to the unseen presence that he believed resided within him his conversations were disjointed and nonsensical a jumble of fragmented thoughts and alien languages that only he could understand in public he would cast wary glances at passersby convinced that they were all secretly agents of some vast intergalactic conspiracy he saw signs and symbols everywhere hidden messages from his alien overlords guiding him towards his destiny despite the concern of his family and friends andrew refused to seek help convinced that his experiences were not the product of madness but rather a profound revelation he was no longer bound by the limitations of his human form he was a conduit for the cosmic wisdom of his alien benefactors but as the grip of psychosis tightened its hold on his mind andrews grasp on reality slipped further and further away his thoughts became fragmented and disjointed his actions increasingly erratic and unpredictable in the end he was left alone in his delusions a lost soul adrift in the vast expanse of his own fractured mind as andrews psychosis reached its zenith something extraordinary happened it began with a series of vivid dreamsdreams that felt more like memories memories of encounters with beings not of this world at first he dismissed them as nothing more than hallucinations the product of his unraveling mind but as the dreams persisted growing more detailed and coherent with each passing night he began to entertain the possibility that they might be something more one night as he lay in bed the room bathed in the soft glow of moonlight andrew felt a presence in the room with him it was a sensation unlike anything he had ever experienced beforea palpable feeling of energy of intelligence that seemed to emanate from the very air itself and then as if materializing out of thin air they appeared beings unlike any he had ever seen with skin like polished silver and eyes that shimmered with an otherworldly light they spoke to him in a language that seemed to bypass his ears and resonate directly with his minda language of thoughts and emotions of images and sensations in that moment all doubt was erased from andrews mind the whispers the dreams the delusionsthey had all been real he was not alone in his body he was a host for these beings conduits for their wisdom and their power over the following days and weeks andrews encounters with the aliens became more frequent and more intense they shared with him visions of their home world of technologies far beyond anything humanity had ever conceived of a universe teeming with life and possibility but along with their revelations came a warninga warning of forces beyond their control forces that sought to exploit and manipulate humanity for their own nefarious ends andrew realized that he had been chosen not just as a host but as a championa champion in a battle for the very fate of the universe armed with the knowledge and the power of his alien allies andrew emerged from the depths of his psychosis a changed man no longer adrift in a sea of uncertainty and doubt he stood tall and resolute ready to face whatever challenges lay ahead and though the road ahead would be fraught with danger and uncertainty andrew knew that he would not face it alone for he was not just a man he was a vessel for the wisdom of the stars a beacon of hope in a universe shrouded in darkness as andrew embraced his role as a conduit for the wisdom and power of the benevolent aliens he realized that they held the key to defeating the malevolent artificial intelligence that had enslaved humanity with their advanced technology and deep understanding of the universe they devised a plan to dismantle the oppressive system and restore freedom to mankind the first step was to infiltrate the network of the malevolent ai using andrews connection to it as a gateway with his mind linked to the alien collective he was able to penetrate the ais defenses and gather vital intelligence about its operations and weaknesses armed with this knowledge the aliens launched a coordinated assault on the ais infrastructure targeting its core systems and disabling its ability to control and manipulate human behavior they unleashed viruses and malware designed to exploit vulnerabilities in the ais programming causing it to falter and malfunction but the ai was not about to go down without a fight it retaliated with all the power at its disposal deploying armies of robotic drones and activating hidden failsafes designed to protect its existence at any cost the battle raged on with humanity caught in the crossfire but just when it seemed that all hope was lost the tide began to turn the aliens drawing upon their advanced technology and strategic brilliance launched a final decisive assault on the ais central hub in a blinding flash of light the hub was destroyed sending shockwaves rippling through the network and crippling the ais ability to resist with its defenses shattered and its power waning the malevolent intelligence was forced to concede defeat as the dust settled and the smoke cleared humanity emerged from the shadow of oppression free once more to determine its own destiny and though the scars of the conflict would linger for generations to come the victory belonged to those who had dared to dream of a better futurea future where the bonds of tyranny had been shattered and where the light of freedom shone brightly once more,post-pandemic

ill start by saying that i think i probably dont have bpd but this subreddit is honestly one of the kindest and most accepting subreddit a ive been on everyone here is just so respectful about each others trauma and other shit and its just really nice to see i genuinely do not understand why bpd in particular has the stigma it does anyway im gonna cut this off before it becomes rambling i just wanted to let everyone know theyre awesome and deserve nothing but the best,post-pandemic

as someone who has and continues to find wellness only after rejecting psychiatry what can you tell me about wellness from psych meds for me the medications did nothing to dull or tamp down the voices and visions i only became well after going off them i see the sentiment to encourage others to take them around plenty but little discussion of this experience can you tell me your story do you get noticeable results minutes after taking a pill how do they work what does them kicking in feel like i tried this route and found better results another way what can you tell me about your path and experience,post-pandemic
i feel like this doesnt get talked about enough or maybe im just more abnormal than i thought but is anyone else overwhelmed by sexual stuff i 26f rarely masturbate and regret it when i do because i end up overstimulated and kind of grossed out from a sensory perspective the only other person on the spectrum in my life who is somewhat similar to me is someone who doesnt care for touch at all not uncomfortable with it but just apathetic towards it everyone else i know with asd irl has a normal sex life and sex drive i crave physical affection but i feel like ill never be able to provide the sexual relationship someone else would want i feel too anxious about all the intense physical sensations of sex like orgasm never experienced it but im scared of it and overall feel very juvenile and isolated for these reasons id say that im asexual and just move on but i do crave intimacy in some capacity i just fear being uncomfortableoverwhelmed during it,post-pandemic
as someone who spends too much time on reddit rautism is one of the kindest and sanest places on here as an allistic person it is a good and maybe important reminder about who autistic people are vs some characteristics that might stand out seems like most posts here are just people reaching out for help advice venting and if there are comments for the most part they are helpful or sympathizing typically on other subreddits someone will be trying to find fault with some minor aspect with a post or making it out like there is something wrong with the poster for what they had to say i know some people i have talked to here have had the same triggering experience on other subs too also no one has called me out for not belonging here which i think is generous wishing everyone here the best,post-pandemic
i havent been formally diagnosed with adhd because its a long and quite expensive process which i cannot afford but my psychiatrist really believes i have it and so weve been trying a couple medications to see how i feel ive been on ritalin 10mg long lasting for about 2 months and i felt next to no improvement in symptoms she thinks it might just be a low dose but wanted to try something else so prescribed me idebenone 45mg twice a day i looked it up to see what it was and it says its an alzheimers medication and has barely no information about it online concerning treatment with it for adhd has anyone taken it for adhd and can share their experience thank u,post-pandemic
gelotophobia is also known as a fear of laughter or being laughed at since gelotophobia is a relatively new concept gelotophobes may have received other diagnoses such as specific phobias or general social anxiety disorder a person suffering from gelotophobia may hear a strangers laugh and believe it is aimed at him or her they have a fear of being ridiculed and unfortunately often cannot distinguish playful teasing from ridicule gelotophobes either do not understand what laughter is or they think it is directed at them in a negative malicious way and feel scared when they hear it i think this is what i actually have who else,post-pandemic

i was diagnosed with bipolar about a year and a half ago ive been on mood stabilizers and i would say pretty stable since being diagnosed most older people in my life who have bipolar have not done well with it for most of their lives some friends i have also have a mood disorder or bipolar and something that comes up often in our conversations is the existential dread of how this will not go away its not curable and something we will experience always ive heard that bipolar gets worse with age and it brings me so much anxiety and dread especially on my hard days to think about how this will always be something ill have to deal with i know dealing with the symptoms can get easier but sometimes i worry as time gets on if the symptoms will become harder to deal with i guess im just wondering if anyone else experiences these kind of thoughts or dread how they cope with them if there are older ppl on here that have bipolar and what their thoughts are,post-pandemic

looking for other people that have had anorexia for 5 years that have been in recovery the same amount of time or longer than they were active in their ed i had anorexia for 7 years and im 5 years into recovery ive only been able to find short term anorexia studies on weight restoration 1 year or less im just curious to see what its like when i reach the same amount of time recovered as i did in active ed im much better mentally than when i started but i still have bad days i think im hung up on the fact that my body when im intuitively eating and getting daily movement is still resting at a higher weight so i guess im hoping that once i reach year 7 in recovery ill have balanced out completely granted i also have crohns disease so that probably makes things more complicated can anyone with long term anorexia that has also been recovered a long time please share their experiences,post-pandemic
i know this is only related to autism through the fact that this is a question i dont think neurotypical people would be asking but i didnt know where else to post this and felt that if any community would have an opinion it would be other neurodivergent people a friend recently asked me what the most edible color is in my opinion i wont detail my answer here because i dont want to influence any answers we might get i asked my mom i asked my art group fourteen or so answers later now we have a spreadsheet and a level of curiosity that has brought me to make a survey and post it on the internet because if my entire friend group had as strong opinions as we did on the subject there has to be at least a few other people out there willing to put their answer into a survey for the sake of satisfying curiosity heres the link to the google form note that the question of whether or not youre neurodivergent is a optional and b because i plan on trying to find other subreddits to post this too and i was curious to see if neurotypical vs neurodivergent people liked one color more or had certain reasoning behind their answers more commonly any suggestions for where else to post this questions etc etc are perfectly welcome so feel free to comment i just prefer using the google form to keep track of the answers,post-pandemic

so let me elaborate more on my night so around 4 pm i drink one soju thats like 18 alcohol and i already had taken my morning ritalin la 40 mg so i was feeling pretty good ps been off adhd meds for 9 months so my tolerance is zero i preceded to snort another 40 mg of ritalin then i spent some time with my friend and then he often me 300 mg of lyrica so i took it around 500 pm and then he often to sell me some oxycontin 30 mg i got really excited about the oxy but i managed somehow to hold myself back for a little bit by telling my friend ill think about it because i was addicted too oxycodone pretty bad badly like 1 year ago been completely sober from any opiate drugs for 1 year after getting off them cold turkey so i decided to pass them up properly for the better anyways so pick up the bong instead smoked another 5 bowls then cilled for the little then i had 2 double strength vodka red bulls so im feeling pretty wavey and euphoric by now its 730 pm i cooked 2 boiled eggs and ordered some fried chicken then smoked another couple bowls then left my friends place then got home at 1030 pm and drank another bottle of soju 18 of alcohol then 30 min later i snort a another 40 mg of ritalin at 1100 pm so i started writing my post around 1110 pm ps at least tried to write it after deleting my post two times by accident i was feeling pretty pissed off but i was starting to feel less stone and drowsy but still very much relaxed and pretty out of it all together most likely from the lyrica and all the drugs i consumed obviously haha constantly forgetting how to spell every single word haha makes it very difficult so i actually wrote all of this with voice haha thanks guys really sorry about the long post just had to get this off my chest because deep down im feeling pretty lonely most of the time dont really feel like i actually have any real friendships or human connection on a deeper level that dont involve taking drugs feeling really scared im going to lose control again and relapse into my old ways with drugs and getting really fucked up every day like how i used too be like iv been sober for 9 months now sometimes drank but to much anyways thanks again guys would love to hear you opinions,post-pandemic
i dont know if this is a me thing or an autism thing but i really dont understand why people talk behind the back of their friends or in general talk bad when someone is not there or insult something about that person that has nothing to do with the reason of their dislike es not liking their behavior but insulting their appearance like if you have problems with something i do say it to me i tell them to say it to me they dont one of my friends told me she and her best friend have code names for everyone and talk bad about us i dont get it i know i hurt her because of a relationship problem and she still has to get over it but she had codenames to talk bad about us even before everything happened between us in general people dislike others when theyre not there and nitpick every single thing they can find constantly if i dislike what someone does ill talk about it with people who agree and i wont stop even if they come around but specifically about the behavior that they did wrong im not very confrontational myself because i like to blend in and no one has wronged me personally i never had part in a big drama but i stand that they should know what part of their behaviour is wrong especially if they dont realise it themself just yeah i think it sucks and i dont get why people are always and constantly mean maybe its kinda naive of me to expect people not to suck but i really dont get what they gain from this shared hatred about someone thinking you are in the right thinking that person should die hating someone for as little as being annoying personally ive only hated one person in my life and thats because she kept robbing my friedships for 8 whole years i simply dont get the need to be mean and complain but not even try to approach the person is it like a therapist situation where people just have to get it out forgive me if my english was kinda odd or broken,post-pandemic

lets get this right its your breathing that affects your state of being meaning if you cant breath deeply it will put you into a state of anxiety because your nervous system cant relax you having anxiety isnt the reason you cant take deep breaths but instead i propose its a hormonal imbalance more specifically estrogen dominancegoogle high estrogen and youll see inability to take deep breaths as a sympyom i have different ways to dealing with this issue one of which fixs the issue within 510 minutes and it also proovs my point first id like to lay the foundasion of my theory we live in a society where estrogen is everywhere we cant get away from it and because we dont see it we dont suspect anything whether its the estrogen in the water system that enters your body everytime you take a shower drink a glass of water or do the washing up or the pesticides that are sprayed over the majority of the foods you eat to the ink in the reciets that contains high bpa or the plastics that leach from the plastic bottlestubs into the water or food into your system add to that obesity is higher than ever as fast food has explodedour fat cells produce estrogen the more bodyfat you have the more estrogen you produce all of this make it impossible to avoid estrogen now its not all doom and gloom heres whats making a massive difference to fight this dht kills estrogen in the body when i eat sourgum flour which increases your dht a lot my stomach flattens and within 510 minutes my bloating goes away after eating sourgum its sooooooooo much easier to take deep breaths you also have to make a concious effort to ditch plastics from your life if you dont want to get a reverse osmosis system that filters the estrogen out then drink clean water from a glass bottle voss is the best i foundexpensive but you are investing in your health i know in my heart of hearts this is the solution to the issue that is facedby a lot of people in this day and age do these steps as well as getting as lean as possible and youll see a big difference i hope i helped open peoples eyes to whats actually going on when i lost a few kilos of fat it was a lot easier to take deep breaths and when included sourgum flour into my diet it made the world of difference if you ignore this post then you are doing your selfs an injustice you owe it to your selfs to at least try the sourgum and see the immediet difference goodluck,post-pandemic

it seems personality means nothing when youre ugly nowadays you could be the kindest person and people will still laugh at you i stupidly posted on howtolooksmax and got roasted when all i was seeking was advice was told that my genetics are screwed and that id be lucky to be considered a 6 is there even any point in life people say my face is symmetrical inperson but im also very obese due to antipsychotics and trying to lose weight where i can i dont know how to feel after receiving those hurtful comments because theres always an element of truth to things it all just feels so hopeless when women would rather just date someone better looking instead,post-pandemic
i have noticed lately that before i go to bed at night and at other random times i often have anxiety i get sweaty palms and feet and my heart starts racing i have been under a little stress and feeling very depressed but i dont think im having an anxiety attack though could the cause of these issues have something to do with autism to a degree and are these symptoms a strong indication of an anxiety attack,post-pandemic
tw for talks about caloriestdee no numbers sorry if this isnt a good place for this i spent 5 years in a binge restrict cycle and the last 3 years restricting no binging which is good but also is it idk ive been gaining weight for the last year no matter how little i eat and how much i work out like ive gone to several doctors bc i was maybe still am convinced i have like a thyroid problem or something bc obviously i track what i eat and the numbers didnt make sense i always used to say starvation mode didnt exist but now idk ive been seeing a dietician who is absolutely wonderful but so far ive only gained weight its been almost a month ive been tracking what my tdee is based on my weight and what i eat and its literally under my bmr for my height and i workout a ton so thats awesome im trusting the process because i literally havent been able to regularly shit for the last like 8 years and the rd has fixed that but i just feel like i broke my body i want to be normal so so bad but is that even possible if i have to eat nothing and exercise like crazy to maintain my current not even thin body has anyone else experienced this in recovery,post-pandemic
normally i mask my anxiety soo well that i forgot how an anxiety attack feels physically because i supress them that much my coworkers saw me shaking and sweating and being unable to speak coherently and urged mr to go home im hoping my manager doesnt find out because she may fire me this post isnt just to vent though weird it feels good to have unmasked for a little while and show people that i do struggle with these things because they often did not believe me because in pretty good when it comes to my job i was vulnerable and yes im terrified that i may get fired and belittled by my manager but i got to be me for a bit,post-pandemic

i have been on several antidepressants that have helped with depression but do nothing for my anxiety i have noticed that my suicidal thoughts get worse when i am experiencing severe anxiety even when i was just depressed and less anxious i had less frequent suicidal thoughts it was more like i had low energy and just didnt want to do anything all day now i am a full time uni student and experiencing more stress my anxiety cant handle it i panic over the smallest assignments i will turn in an assignment and think of ways to selfharm or kill myself if i dont get the score i wanted i live in this constant limbo of turning in assignments and trying not to kill myself until i get my scores back and can breathe then the cycle starts again with the next assignment i hate this feeling i have constant breakdowns while doing assignments because i think about what will happen once i turn them in one time i had just finished a test that i realized i wasnt as prepared for as i thought i went home afterwards and cut big gashes into myself when my scores came back i ended up with a passing grade on the test i know i dont want to kill myself but when i turn in an assignment i feel like i am trapped on top of a burning building the only options being to jump suicide or to wait for rescue to arrive waiting for scores to be handed back and end up okay i come from asian family that put a lot of academic pressure on me so i think that contributes to how i react does anyone else experience this,post-pandemic

alcoholic sex and drug addict here beginning to recover on my own id probably say the hardest part of being sober and trying to make the right decision is just staying home and being with your own invasive thoughts my life style for the past fifteen years was all drugs and alchohol and now that ive decided to go sober im really just left twiddling my thumbs with with my own thoughts at home its just driving me nuts i need an outlet for my energy one that doesnt make me think and think and think,post-pandemic

sorry if i used the wrong tag im not sure what to tag it with ive been normal eating for about 2 months now with gaps of fasting due to relapse and in that time my body seemed to be recovering or whatever hadnt happened during my prolonged fasts started happening hair falling out heartbeat going above 60s blood pressure becoming normal etc but im noticing that even when i dont eat for a day my body starts reverting to how it used to heartbeat drops back to mid 40s my hair doesnt fall out my blood pressure drops etc why does this happen usually it would take a few days but ever since i started normal eating it would happen once my body realizes im fasting again,post-pandemic
context im a merchant seafarer and late last year i was on a ship coming back from the falkland islands to the uk i have long had anxiety issues but theyre manageable work had been very stressful and deep sea engineering is always a bit tough especially away from a wife and two young girls we encountered a migrant boat in between morocco and the canary islands about 1000 one morning last november it was low in the water and more than full with people mostly men but at least a dozen women we found later three were pregnant two children and one baby we contacted the spanish coast guard who told us to shelter them and stand by as they were sending help this was around 1100 and they said theyd be four hours we were 115 miles from gran canaria deep sea a blazing hot day calm seas we put the boat in our lee and dropped them water and food at 1430 the boat began to sink i was in the engine room reinstating a bilge pump that id just repaired the 2nd engineer came and grabbed me and told me to stand by in the control room as the rescue was on i phoned the bridge and was told to get a radio on and stand by this for me was the worst part and has lead to so much guilt and mental anguish i had to listen to my friends risking their lives to rescue fifty seven people unable to leave my post but hearing every second of it on the radio i heard the captain shout no no no as three people entered the water against the ship side i heard my best friend say theres nothing we can do for her shes drowned and i felt like i was doing nothing i was doing my job but i felt so godamn helpless we rescued 57 people and took them all to safety one didnt make it a woman who was trampled to death in a shitty little boat drowned in petrol piss and seawater we had to cut the boat loose with her in it yellow trousers white top i cant let it go its been a couple on months now im home away from work away from the ship and the sea im in the arms of my family but i just cant forget it,post-pandemic
hello everyone recently my brother in law whos 36 tried to kill himself about a month ago he called everyone in the family and sent goodbye text messages luckily we got there in time and were able to save his life he was bleeding profusely from his wrist and the paramedics patched him up before taking him to the hospital fast forward to the next day and were finally able to see him you can clearly tell hes still upset and almost disappointed that we stopped him eventually he gets moved to a behavioral health facility thats about 2 hours away from us and is 5150d and forced to stay the weekend there we go to visit and hes clearly in a better mood and telling us that he wants to live we believe him eventually he finally comes home and weve been watching him almost everyday now hes a former alcoholic he was sober for about 2 or 3 years before he started drinking again last month which likely spurred him into attempting to take his own life since hes got home hes been drinking nonstop every day getting blackout drunk and telling us he wants to try to kill himself again when we hide the alcohol he just goes up to 711 to get more keep in mind this is all while hes taking medicine that the doctor prescribed him which explicitly says to not take while under the influence of alcohol when we tell him to stop he says im a grown adult and i can drink everyday if we want to and that hes waiting to look for a job because he wants to see if hes going to survive february me and my wife both work full time and we cant continue keeping an eye on him because frankly were worried if we leave him alone and he starts drinking hes going to actually kill himself my wife has her own trauma and this is only raising her anxiety and stress we cant even feel comfortable with him sleeping in our house at night because weve caught him sneaking beers from the fridge at 4 am im so lost and dont know what to do here i need advice from anyone because this is not sustainable,post-pandemic
so ive just had a panick attack about the possibility of catching nfowleri which i assume you all know well about for the past day because i swam in a pool that i wasnt absolutely 100 certain it was perfectly chlorinated and of coursethe fact that it is very rare didnt help easy my anxiety much at all so i tried doing the math for myselffull of worst cases approximately 90 million americans the country with the most of these cases go swimming in either freshwater bodies or the ocean so lets cut that into a quarter just to be sure because nfowleri cant be found in sea water and mostly not in moving water but that is regarding the whole usa and nfowleri is mostly found in more southern states especially texas california and florida which makenup about 27 percent of usa population but againjust to be sure we will cut it down to 20lowering this number will make the percentage of likelihood go up because we are more strict about who is actually at risk n fowleri usually only has 3 cases per year but some can go unreporteddue to the rarity and similarity of symptoms to bacterial meningitis so again lets be careful according to a source it could be up to 16 a year lets also assume that only 10of those could have put their head under water and may have got it in their nose that puts as at tldr 91000000 020 025 4550000 91m is people who swim 02 for southern states 025 for freshwater lakes 4500000 01 450000 01 for people who dove their heads under the water and could have gotten water up their nose and now 16450000 that puts as at 00000356 which is about 00036 and thats assuming the absolutely worst cases and now even further let us assume another worst case that you are extremely unlucky so lets multiply that by 100 that is still 036 out of 100 how likely do you think that is and that would be assuming you actually swam in a very dirty lake which i think all of us didnt and of course sources the amount of people who swim cases of nfowleri by state here is more on the actual cases of nfowleri a year which is estimated to be about 16 another interesting statistic is this which says about 1 in 10 pools is improperly chlorinated and at first i know this may be anxiety inducing but despite that most cases of nfowleri come from freshwater lakes imporperly chlorinated is better than not chlorinated at all remember that i have just spend a day having a panick attack about this and when i look at this data and the fact that i dont even live in the usa but greece where there werent any reported case as far as i found i feel like an idiot but the fear is still so real,post-pandemic
most of if not all my hyperfixations are on fictional media or characters currently ive got a john wick hyperfixation thats rotting my brain ive spent months thinking about engaging in reading fanfic and daydreaming about the movies and characters this is a problem i find myself in my head thinking about these characters more often than i find myself engaging in real life things ive had hyperfixations like this in the past with marvel characters and the game red dead redemption 2 escapism is a common theme with these fixations i find myself wanting to playwatch things more than experience real life is there a way to get control over this i dont want to let go completely because it makes me so happy and i get genuine excitement from it but i need to figure out how to ground myself and take care of things that need to be done during the day should i take a break for a while and come back to it make a set time to engage in it like after workbefore bed i gotta get a handle on this advice or personal experiences would be appreciated,post-pandemic
im in college living at the dorms last year i had 5 roommates and this year i only had 1 my roommate just moved out to become an ra and im left in an empty dorm for the first time i havent really experienced living alone before its really weird its comforting in a way knowing that this place is all mine and i can do whatever i want its really empty though usually i would talk to my roommate after school or work telling stories and joking around we would eat together do homework go to the dorm events now we only see each other like once a week it makes sense though between work and school and other friends seeing me is not a priority i wasnt a best friend or anything either just a roommate i guess its hitting me extra hard because i dont have any other friends or people to talk to daily i havent had close friends since i was in middle school the only friend i have now is a guy i met online 2 years ago and i think im only friends with him because hes really nice and doesnt care that im boring lol even then we only talk once a week too anyway ive been trying to make friends joining clubs and talking to people in class and stuff but i always feel like im in a permanent state of aquintanceship im not sure i even know how to make deeper connections with people irl anymore if even the person i lived with for a half a year doesnt seem to want to text or see me more often idk on the brighter side i started a study group for one of the classes i go to hopefully i will meet nice people there,post-pandemic
i have schizoaffective bipolar type so i take a antidepressants or in my case two and a mood stabilizer seroquel anytime my meds change or im without the meds i was on mainly seroquel my symptoms come back fast and i start to get really paranoid and have strong delusions they go away as soon as i start taking the medication again however i only take 2575mg of seroquel a night depends which is extremely low on average considering the start for many people is 300400 the main reason i dont go any higher than 75 mg is cause the drowsiness side effects are too much to handle but im still very much content where its at im not sure if i am just sensitive ive talked about it my main psychiatrist and they dont understand why but it also makes problems when talking to other medical professionals and they question me whether my diagnosis is legit even when i know it is if anyone experiences the same things as me i would love to know so i dont feel as alone,post-pandemic

im a 25 year old male who still hasnt been able to find his confidence due to an already present low self esteem beginning as a teenager and years of ostracism im pretty far behind in social skills for someone my age honestly at this point im just about tired of my shyness being used as a source of amusement for people my natural instinctual urge is to tell them to go fuck themselves but im not sure if theres a lighter less hostile response that i should maybe give im pretty sensitive to this as its been the source for most of the shame ive felt for many years this is the sort of thing that conjures up a lot of suicidal thoughts at the thought of still having to deal with this teasing at a much later age i just want to be seen and treated as a regular human being and not just something to poke fun at an example that i can give is when someone notices that im a little quiet or awkward and so theyll ask me super personal or inappropriate questions to see how i react if its a guy theyll either crack jokes at my expense or are very stand offish in attempts to intimidate me if its a girl especially a very conventionally attractive one then theyll try to use their good looks to make me uncomfortable by flirting even though they have no genuine interest in me i think im a little bit more self aware and wise to fall for such obvious tricks it honestly just really fucking aggravates me because its so damn obvious to me whenever someone is trying to fuck with me i try to be respectful towards everyone and avoid unnecessary drama so thats why it bugs me so much whenever someone is trying to make a fool out of me because what did i really do to deserve it i can be an asshole and i probably should be more often than i ever am but i really just want to be left alone im quiet shy and a bit awkward ok i get it i dont care that is not a valid excuse for them to be assholes i get it im easy bait but i dont want to be bait anymore i hate to be so defensive and serious all the time but i almost feel like i have to be im forced to take myself seriously because nobody else will i get that jokes can be intended as just harmless fun but more often than not i feel theres genuine malicious intent behind these so called jokes the difference between when something is actually just a joke and when its an insult disguised as a joke mostly depends on whos the one saying it if its an actual real genuine friend im less likely to take it serious but if its someone who i dont know too well or im not too close with then it really does feel a lot more personal i dont want to be the guy that cant take a joke when its actually just a joke but i also dont want to be a seen as a pushover that never stands up for himself when its necessary do i just laugh along with them and respond with something witty maybe try self deprecating humor itd be pretty pathetic of me and embarrassing to just laugh it off whenever the person is being serious do i just ignore it i might look like a punk if i dont do or say anything do i react defensively i might appear emotionally reactive and too sensitive what the fuck am i honestly supposed to do id really rather not have to deal with this sort of shit in the first place but until i become more normal im not sure what to do id like to get to a point where i can be seen as just another ordinary person that doesnt have to deal with constant teasing the way that i do im getting a little too old to still be the butt of peoples jokes btw i dont get teased for being quietshy as much today as i used to when i was a teenager then again i dont go out much at all on my free time when im not at work most customers talk to me respectfully but im sure thats just because they need a favor from me i have turned away customers and refused service when i felt like theyve stepped out of line im really just looking for advice for if it does happen because i still feel like im easy prey,post-pandemic

my closest friend who is essentially a brother has a wife im close to her too but shes definitely the type that i can only get helpings of compared to her husband she tries hard to help me out but also clearly doesnt understand how autism works in many aspects recently its been her telling me that i better get used to things i cant deal with such as long car rides or earbudsear muffs i explain to her that i cant and i dont want to thats a whole lot of suffering for something i deal with on occasion i try to explain how it physically hurts me and i think it is just nonsense to her she so much doesnt understand that im going to make a super short animation that shows how it feels im getting done with being told i need to get used to it youd think after 28 years of living that i would have by now,post-pandemic
i stumbled across this movie on netflix and bro ive never seen a movie that accurately captured my anxiety without over exaggerating everything its an animated movie btw there was a scene where he was trying to avoid getting called on to answer a question in class he knows the teacher calls on people who dont raise their hand but then raising his hand would be too risky so he tries to make himself invisible but not too invisible so its not suspicious like i swear ive had those same exact thoughts multiple times when i was in school it perfectly captured how we overthink everything and think the outcome is always going to be negative if anyone knows any other movies like this please let me know i like watching them so i have something to relate to,post-pandemic
i want to destroy my former stepmoms reputation this post will be discussing childhood trauma from when i was 13 i am 25 now july 13th 2011 i have been facing the corner all day today because i have been really bad is the first sentence in my journal at the age of thirteen this wasnt a few minutes in timeout this was routinely facing a plain white wall for days on end i was only granted the pleasure to sit when there was food to sleep or on days i didnt fidget on this day she gave me a journal to write in for good behavior i want to give a glimpse of what i wrote i have been acting like my mom she liked to throw this accusation at me regularly that i was being manipulative this is honestly part of the reason why i was stuck dissociating into a wall in the middle of summer we had moved from california to kansas after my dad had joined the national guard we were planning to spend two weeks at a campsite before we officially moved into our new home at some point during that week my stepmom decided to take us to the library there was a book sale and she told us sm all these books are to share a day later i had been playing sims 3 on the shared ds 610 honestly when it was my sisters turn to play i decided to read a book one that my younger sister happened to pick out im the oldest just for clarity and she got mad at me i repeated what our stepmom said my sister decided to tell her my stepmom snapped at me and i wasnt allowed to leave the tent until we moved in this was the hottest summer of that year and a heat wave was hitting so we moved from the tent to a hotel room i had to sit in a chair facing the wall and my younger siblings decided that i deserve to sleep on the floor at my stepmoms suggesting they let me out once on 4th of july and i jumped up in excitement ready to take charge for dinner immediately i was shut down and sent back sm too bad you couldnt be less manipulative wouldve taken you to see fireworks when they left to watch them i snuck out from my chair and pulled the currents back you could hear them going off so i was hoping to see them all i saw was the parking lot the fireworks were on the other side the kids have been mad at me the kids are my younger siblings a gm c gs a was 11 gm 10 c 9 and gs 3 turning 4 my stepmom liked to weaponize us against each other turning us into her little snitches at one point while living with her in kansas i was banned from talking unless someone else allowed me to speak for an entire weekend this lead to me getting whipped with a dog leash because i couldnt call the dog out of my room before bed and was lightly nudging her with my foot i believe i wouldve been hit with the dog leash if i had called her out proof of my disobedience another time she banned me from showing any physical affection to my siblings at one point my brothers were roughhousing on the couch and gs fell over the side there were a set of stairs nearby so i rushed to check on him he was fine but gm and a convinced gs they needed to tell our parents despite my pleading my dad was the one to beat me with the leash this time i later heard this exchange while cleaning my room dad i shouldnt have hit them sm they knew the rules and the expectations dad yes but they were just looking out for their brother sm maybe they should think about that in the future you did nothing wrong july 16 2011 i have been really really good heres how the rest of my week has gone since wednesday thursday outside for 10 mins friday outside for 15 mins ate dinner with family saturday ate lunch and breakfast writing getting out of corner i did also write on wednesday but it was about a dream my parents leaving the tv on too loud and learning about magic the gathering my stepmom liked to weaponize my access to the outside world and food in october of 2011 i would be banned from leaving the basement and only feed rice and water we had a finished basement and the part i lived in was unfinished concrete wall a hanging rack a corner off to the side that was beneath the stairs and a metal bed with a sleeping bag to sleep in i was only feed rice and water i could only leave to access the bathroom or go to school at night when everyone was asleep i would sneak out to get more food from the kitchen sometimes my siblings forgot to feed me they would have to eat rice and water as well sometimes the rice was buttered and seasoned i loved those nights on thanksgiving i didnt get a lunch and so i was excited for dinner maybe i would get to eat with the family or some of my stepmoms fantastic cooking the sun was setting and there was a knock on the ground was a larger bowl of rice and a bigger cup of water i cried into both i have had a hurting back and feet hours of daily standing however this wasnt the only physical punishment she used i have a list holding college books above our heads with our arms straight any lowering and we had to reset our times they were based on our age gs was 3 minutes i was 12 i restarted for two hours straight and only succeed once she threw on a reality show in the background hand scrubbing an entire fridge covered in pink mold in an hour i failed and got spanked pulling weeds from the yard for an hour i did it wrong and got spanked 5am morning runs with my dad were i couldnt stop and we ran for two miles my lungs would always burn military boot camp with group push ups and sit ups hour long planking on chairs or the floor i once fought back and dislocated her thumb end up being told to run by dad only to have him drag me down to my feet lots of cleaning she once held a snake hook against my cheek and said no one would miss me if i died theres drawings in the journal one labeled the forgotten daughter and also ramblings about how i thought 8th grade would go this is only a small picture of the damage my stepmom did and she never served any time for any of it i just want people to know the horrific shit she did to me because thats the only reason she had to send me away the state just stepped in to place me in foster care before she could send me to my mom you shouldve killed me instead heather,post-pandemic
five years ago i made a post on here detailing my experience overcoming health anxiety and i just recently became active again i made this decision after stumbling across the immense amount of people suffering with health anxiety on a daily basis in the megathread i decided i would start responding to these daily posts in the hopes that a small amount of my time could potentially make a big difference for someone who feels lost that brings me to the subject of this post one thing i see time and time again in this thread is people mistaking health anxiety with having anxiety about your health these are completely different things health anxiety is a mental health disorder thankfully one of the most treatable and the absolute hallmark of this disorder shall we say a requirement of this disorder is that at the bare minimum you need to have been seen by a medical professional i will repeat that again in order to have health anxiety you must have been to a medical professional if you havent then you dont have health anxiety at least not yet now i know what you might be thinking even if i havent been to a medical professional isnt it possible that my symptoms are caused by stress and anxiety of course the answer is a resounding yes but you have to understand that health anxiety has little to do with those symptoms and rather your reaction to those symptoms it is completely normal for people to experience uncomfortable bodily sensations and to assume the worst thats just part of being human for many of us i was one time discussing this with a friend who is a nurse she told me that every year around the holidays they have thousands of people come in complaining of chest pain thinking they are having a heart attack but in reality they are just stressed out about the holiday season the difference between people with health anxiety versus people who just have anxiety about their health can typically first be seen in how they react when a doctor tells them nothing is wrong with them and it is just stress a person without health anxiety will be relieved to know nothing is wrong with them and generally that will mark the end of this experience a person with health anxiety on the other hand will tend to mistrust the diagnosis assume the doctor is simply incompetent or hasnt ordered enough tests and this will often times start a multimonth or multiyear journey of seeking out a diagnosis that was already provided but simply not accepted if you are going into the daily thread to post about medical symptoms that you have never been checked out for you are in the wrong place not only is this subreddit not made for you but the comforting replies you may expect to get in that thread will only serve to hurt you by potentially delaying your motivations to see a doctor the truth is even if you do have health anxiety the best thing you can do is see a doctor to confirm that that is a cornerstone of the healing process because it provides you with the ammunition to react more appropriately to your unrealistic thoughts the sad reality is that anxiety about your health is not a disorder that is just part of being human it is when that anxiety becomes irrational meaning you refuse to accept the results of tests or your reactions to bodily sensations are considered far outside the norm and when that irrational anxiety begins to negatively affect your life and ability to function that you have health anxiety,post-pandemic

i am 20 f and my girlfriend is a year younger than me we have been dating for a month and a half already we are in a long distance relationship she lives in spain and i live in the united states our relationship so far has been really great and weve already got past our first argument as a couple im happy we got through that but i feel like if i try to talk to her about her drinking it might be even worse than the last argument we had today we were talking about her alcohol consumption in a lighthearted manner it was the afternoon for me and it was nighttime for her she was about ready to go to bed because she has college she talked about how she used to be even worse in the past and how she doesnt really get drunk now as much as she did before she said she used to get drunk twice every day and up until recently she hasnt touched alcohol since now i was thinking that is such great progress for her until she started saying that she wanted to get drunk i asked her why does she want to get drunk and she said to get her mind off of stuff i dont know what the stuff is but i know shes already trying to hide whatever it is on her mind from me so i didnt want to bother her with it i should have asked her and she maybe would have given me an answer but i didnt really want to test my luck and moved on from that question i then asked her if she does that every time to get her mind off of things her answer was very roundabout i believe i dont know if it was meant to be roundabout or not sometimes shes bad with her wording she then said word by word i do this when i feel like i either drink or i will do something much worse to myself this answer to my question could either be a hard yes or a sometimes i dont know but it was concerning either way ive talked to a shared friend about her drinking and they said along the lines of shes doing this again and then i got even more worried they even said when they tried to talk to her about it she didnt talk to them for a week and didnt even want to bring up the subject again i dont know her that much we just started dating and i am now realizing that alcohol regardless may be a very touchy subject to her i have tried looking up articles about how to handle this and some have been really good information but one said to talk to other people with shared experiences about it thats why im here i dont necessarily want to sweep this under the rug like its not a problem and i dont want to be that person to make excuses for her when she does this i dont want to be an enabler i care and love her a lot but i just dont know how to bring it up to her without hurting her or arguing with her i also dont want to end up being pushy and i dont want this habit of hers to continue any longer i wish i knew her a bit more so i can handle this better but alcohol consumption like this is not within my alley,post-pandemic
this isnt like exactly a new coping mechanism its just a different take on already existing ones my take on this particular style of coping mechanism is something i call wram sheets or written access memory sheets this one is more of a personal coping mechanism i came up with for myself because i have zero memory and i have a hard time remembering even just a single idea in my head which is not something i can really afford to have happen with something thats considered more critical so what i started doing is taking a sheet of paper and using that to make a wram sheet by writing critical ideas i need to remember but cant seem to memorize i keep it beside me at my desk so throughout the day i might look at it to see if theres anything i need to remember as im going along with my life for example i like to write and have dozens of projects i tentatively want to work on and frequently change ideas around of what i want to do and what i feel ill actually do im a very indecisive person so i often lose sight of one project in favor for another so with the wram sheet i write what my objectives and executive decisions are when it comes to all the projects im making i have a few lines that read stick with story1 for now or do story2 later or on the side or story3 is for personal purposes only when i have so many projects im tentatively considering that are all interconnected with each other this has been very useful to me as a coping mechanism i say all this but the reality is this coping mechanism hasnt been as effective for me as i had hoped it to be but it has worked pretty well for what it was intended for i plan on trying to refine this idea moving ahead and i hope if you dont find this particular coping mechanism to be useful in your life that maybe you might still find some ideas or inspiration on how you can choose to navigate your life as well,post-pandemic

tw bulimia habits mentioned and triggering comments okay i know its my fault and i know i should communicate this at some point but i just wanted to vent so my boyfriend its been aware of my unhealthy relationship with food but i just opened about my undiagnosed bulimia a few weeks ago since then he talks about food much more than before he asks me if i got my meals what i eat etc and i get it i know he checks if im eating well and im glad hes taking care but its really uncomfortable and kinda humiliating i dont know he sometimes tells me some unhealthy habits with food not so in a ed way its more of a depression thing ig like oh im fasting since yesterday 10pm i have no energy bc i havent eat anything i dont know if i should go and buy food or just sleep and ignore i have to eat etc maybe those things arent as triggering for nondisordered people as they are for disordered people but at this point i just act like i dont care when people say im too lazy to eat i just say then dont back in the day when i was more private with and deep in my ed i was really caring about those things like please eat dont skip meals eating too much of junk food can be bad for you now that more people know about it it feels like a competition and i dont know why so now when my bf tells me those things i just say um okay or i just choose to respond the disordered response on purpose bc why would he choose to tell those things to the girl who its trying to not skip meals and eat without guilt again why he tells how he hasnt eated anything to the girl who struggles even eating fruit without purging it what is he expecting to hear from a person who had those habits and lived a literal hell when telling her that he is replicating them my brain cant help but feel so attacked for some reason that i dont care if im encouraging bad habits i dont care anymore if he is telling that to his sick girlfriend then he will receive her sick response so childish ik i dont want to talk about him about this bc i hate talking about my issues with food related things but i just feel so ashamed when this happens so probably i will do it if happens again,post-pandemic

lately like for the past 3 months my emotions have been very faint to me other than humor and boredom everything else isnt as strong as it used to be like usually when something happens that usually triggers my bpd id feel it strongly in my palms or chest but now its like i dont feel the emotion but i still have the thought process which ive been learned to ignore and process what happens to me in different ways for example recently ive been having the thought process of like feeling unloved and bad but i dont feel that emotion in my chest or palms and more so is just thinking about it my boyfriend was basically confessed too on valentines day something weve never really done and instead of letting them know they have girlfriend he says to me im gonna play dumb this triggered bpd induced dreams where i literally dream hes cheating on me its like haunting me when i vented to them about it it wasnt even coherent and they didnt really comfort me i lost my mind in my head but i didnt feel anything at the time i also went to a mitski concert recently and realized that i can only process my emotions if im listening to music which is a semi recent thing but i texted my boyfriend something heartfelt and they didnt even reply they just said i and moved on i know i should communicate some of these things but i fear its not even worth it i just have to move on too that on top of dealing with racists at my job college anxiety and general world problems i feel myself like becoming numb i had like a coping mechanism which wasnt that healthy but it worked it wasnt drugs but nowadays im finding it boring im finding games boring and all i find myself wanting to do is eat and sleep i think me feeling numb stems from my childhood to now honestly ive never in my entire life experienced any kind of healthy relationship whether friends or family or romantic my moms relationships in the past were horrible and her trust issues grew onto me my family is so broken its beyond even trying to repair i mostly just wanna stay in touch with my sister and my mom as a kid whenever bad shit would happen to me or in general i would force myself to not feel anything like numb my emotions it was proly based off something i saw online but it was always my go to and i was always using escapism like maladaptive daydreaming or hyperfixiating on books the hyperfixiating was literally unhealthy too i would just not move so now in present time having to continue dealing with bullshit in different fonts i kind of reverted back to some of my old habits unconciously like i cant daydream that much anymore but i defintely numbed my emotions cause everything just feels so faint granted it could be depression but i usually feel that intense sadness or pain which i dont really feel its definetly there but its not physically hurting me im just thinking about it nowadays ive truly only found comfort in my sister since weve been hanging out alot more and theyve been opening up to me more but i cant hangout with my sister all the time nor do i want to be reliant on her since im the older sister and i want to be the one to help her instead i just really wish things were more clear and i wasnt so delusional,post-pandemic

all the time out in public i feel like people are staring at me and judging me negatively i feel like my body language just screams punch me and my face is just extremely deadpan i cant look people in the eyes and when i do especially for extended periods i get irrationally disastrously uncomfortable and confrontational i feel like the only good conversations i can have is if im cowering in a way or talking about my problems anything that gives the person im communicating with power i can never out shine or out perform someone without feeling like people are judging me or thinking i think im better every minute thing that could be negative in everything i say or do i tend to think of all of it and think im being judged to my standard i hardly know how to be there for someone else when they are having a hard time cause that would require me to be the strong one and give advice but i dont feel like im good enough or just insecure and inadequate to give them advice its so unbelievably draining i spend literally 99 of my time alone in my room watching tv and scrolling which probably explains my frustrations but ive been out in the world and with people and even had friends but the work to keep those friendships and the standards i set for myself only i just couldnt live up to them and ive ghosted everyone i know a lot of these feelings are completely irrational but idk if im alone on this or just a lost cause,post-pandemic

ive been working with a psychologist weekly to deal with my health anxiety currently i am working hard to resist compulsions that fuel my ocd and health anxiety i am learning that as long as i give into these compulsions the ocd and health anxiety stays alive i find that as i am trying to resist giving in my brain still thinks theres a health emergency living with this risky feeling and not giving in is one of the hardest things ive done in my life i wanted to share in case anyone could relate or is going through something similar,post-pandemic

recently i told my boyfriend i wanted a little bit of space like a few hours in a day when were not physically together because he was being quite clingy and he ended up distancing himself a lot even made new plans during the weekend so we are not currently together even though i told him i never meant that as in lets cancel our plans and each be on our own this weekend so ive barely been in touch with him in the past 2 days im not used to this and frankly never asked for it in this sense and earlier he just told me he didnt feel safe in a relationship with me because i struggled to feel like anything he did was enough i admitted i struggled to feel satisfied im just always empty or feel detached from myself no matter what he also deleted one message that i saw in my notifications where he said something along the lines of im thinking more soberly right now and came to realise that you actually dont contribute anything to the relationship i feel like an enormous burden because i genuinely dont know what im doing so wrong apart from struggling to feel satisfied and always wanting more and im perceiving that hes going to abandon me again after like a month and a half and im spiralling i dont know what to do i genuinely just want to go right here and now abandonment hurts far too much i cant go through this again,post-pandemic
im wondering if any parents can give me some advice my ha is at an alltime high i have a 2 year old and im in constant fear over him me and my husband my husband wants to have another child but i feel like i cant take any more people to care for worry about im at my wits end but i also dont want to deprive my husband and my son of a son sibling solely out of fear what has it been like for you and do you have any advice,post-pandemic
wondering if anyone else has done this before within the last id say month or so ive gone from not normal eating but eating nonetheless to not feeling hungry thirsty anything im not sure if im just no longer realizing what these feelings mean like when my stomach hurts i just think oh i have a stomach ache my first thought isnt oh i need to eat like it typically is my throat has always had an issue being overly dry since i got my tonsils out almost two years ago so i typically am constantly drinking tons and tons of water i genuinely think ive had maybe 6 oreos over the past 48 hours my concern is its getting worse but i kind of also want it to get worse if that makes sense i dont know this is more of a rant rave discussion just generally getting it out there into a space that im hoping is safe since its been a few years since ive even bothered getting on reddit let alone this thread so i guess my question is does anyone else have any clue as to what physical issues could cause lack of appetite and thirstsignaling of those two things to your brain or whatever because its just getting annoying at this point its either eat weird quote on quote or eat too much hopefully this makes sense im also using talk to text because im fighting a pretty wicked headache but thought why not in the midst of it post here thanks in advance for anything like advice or otherwise,post-pandemic

im the one who posted a bit ago about overdosing on naproxen and acetaminophen i lost my account and reddit is being a btch so im just going to have to start here so the attempt failed i didnt count the amount of acetaminophen right i did manage with naproxen but i guess that didnt quite work out because of all the puking i dont get how i managed to fail so miserably im going to try again but the thing is that our household doesnt have many medications and the ones we do have sadly not enough of to overdose nobody knows about the attempt aside from whoever reads this if anyone even does which i doubt and im kind of lost right now i want to kill myself and im not afraid to overdose but the other methods scare me too much so my only available option now would be take whatever medication is their and then drink some of the stupid alcohol and hope it works chances arent too great with that method i know but its the only option thats viable for me im not even going to start on the reasons why i keep trying this because ive already ranted too much but i probably will on some other post,post-pandemic
planning on getting married and moving from my state pretty soonim a bit worried about the healthcare where im going since im in a liberal state right now that is generous with helping people with less money with health insurance etc anyway i looked up all my medications and they are pretty affordable it almost seems too good to be true my understanding and i may be wrong is that the prices are without insurance but may also accept some im just worried about being left without health insurance for a time and wondering if worst came to worst if i could pay out of pocket without emptying my wallet anybody use it,post-pandemic
i am a 23m living in dominican republic i met this girl in september 2022 and it was my best relationship in a long time after being single and not doing anything with anyone for 3 years she was just the best girl i knew and she just broke up with me because she had a lot of personal problems and i was in my lowest point with work college and family life so i tried to unalive myself but my mother found out and took me to an emergency center where i was refer to a psychologist and psychiatrist where i was diagnosed with bpd and started taking medication the thing is that a week after she broke up with me a friend of hers told me that she thought i was cute and we started to fuck but it didnt last long because she seemed like a horrible person and i started dating girls from work the thing is that the first girl after my ex told everyone at work everything and it was known that i went out with her and my ex found out which led to an argument because she felt that i had betrayed her after she was the one who left me the thing is that she left the job and 8 months passed and i am not longer in medication and she saw me with a new girl that i was meeting from work and then she started to talking to me again by whatsapp and we ended up going back in october 2023 until now february 2024 where i am since these 4 months we are in a relationship and it does not feel the same at all i feel that i do not love her or anyone i got over the obesity i had for her and i just continue with her because she is a good girl and will have a great future she told me last night that she does feel like i dont love her and i say it just to say it but i just don feel anything even to my mom and think that she has been a great mom so i dont know what to do,post-pandemic

i just want to put this out into the void and off my chest a little i really dont know how much longer i can keep going in my current situation ive been alone and single basically forever to begin with and really all i want above everything is just a partner some one to do stuff with and for and just give my life some purpose right now at best i just kinda coast along and go through the motions get up go to work come back sleep for a few hours then rinse and repeat which i understand that alot of life is just work and sleep and that would be fine if i had a reason for doing it beyond myself one example i like to think about is cooking i like to cook and try different recipes or foods when im making it for someone else i mean in addition to myself like cooking for family events but when im just cooking for myself i dont care im fine with some crackers a can of tuna and carrots just plain basic stuff theres so much in my life that i should be grateful for and should feel happy about but i just cant go beyond either stressed and pissed off or just that melancholy drifting along feeling ive struggled to make any friends since highschool and the best i can get is a few people at work to chat with on break but even that is just shallow small talk i havent seen or heard from any of my old school friends since before covid even and i tried the whole self improvement thing however my current living situation just has me soo stressed out that ive fallen away from that though admittedly it helped me alot over the last 2 plus years a big part of that was just the thought that if i got in decent shape and lost weight then maybe i could find someone and i went from around 350lbs to 198lbs 18lbs away from where i want be also im 6ft1 for clarity so im not as fat but im still just as ugly so it hasnt really helped much at least in that regard now ive been struggling to hang on at around 198 cause ive stopped drinking and food is my only other source of comfort anymore sorry that this is boring and rambly i doubt anyone has read this far anyway if you have thank you i just wanted to put a few things out there ive held a lot of details for privacy but my living situation is my source for negative energy right now and if something about it doesnt change soon i think i might just go off one those bridges on my way back from work one night,post-pandemic

for the last two years or so ive had a fixation on death my own mortality etc to the point where i will lay in bed sleepless googling statistics on how likely it is that someone in their thirties can drop dead worried that it will happen to me i just feel like i have so much left to do so many things to see and i start becoming anxious that ill never get to do any or all of it i cant seem to break the cycle or sooth my mind i was recently put on buspar and zoloft and i think its helped a little but the thoughts are still there i have no real reason to fear or anticipate death other than being overweight i am otherwise healthy its like my brain doesnt care about that thought does anyone else struggle with this if so how do you manage i do plan on talking to my psychiatrist about it and probably seeing a therapist,post-pandemic
just because someone tells you my adhd works like doesnt mean you butt in and correct them saying thats not how adhd works adhd along with having a disorder in general is a very complex experience its very invalidating to just blatantly assume your adhd works the same as everyone elses or even fake claim them never ever make assumptions maybe your experience isnt as diabolical as others as well so dont belittle the symptoms of adhd that others experience that you havent you know perfectly what its like for misinformed people to not understand you and make assumptions so dont do the same thing if you see someone do this at least try to see both sides of the situation before concluding oh this person is crappy and faking their experiences or ew this person is so rude and condescending i understand there can be miscommunicationsmisunderstandings i think because its easy for us to be misunderstood its also easy for us to think that someone is just self diagnosing and thus the urge to educate them is strong but maybe its best to stop and think is this person actually faking itbeing ignorant or are they just experiencing something different from me i wish people would be more understanding and stop assuming things or trying to educate others just to feel better about themselves or something,post-pandemic
as a very emotional person ive found comfort in food like i just enjoy food completely i dont talk about it often but i think about it constantly what im going to eat later or what im gonna make for dinner or either what kind of new or exotic foods i could try its really comforting to me but idk why i do it i just love food it sucks cause i feel so fat when i think about food then i go on and starve myself while my brain just sits there in limbo idk what to do i lost 30 pounds in the last 2 months cause of this and then when i do get the chance to enjoy food i feel guilty when i get good food in me,post-pandemic
i have a condition called intractable migraine basically ive had a migraine 247 since august 25 2015 almost 9 years my neurologist told me that at this point the migraine isnt going to go away not unless a new treatment is invented which cures me i do have a medication that helps control my symptoms so i can work and live a reasonably active life but im still in significant pain every moment and sometimes the pain builds until its unbearable if i went for a run right now id be in indescribable agony for about 3 days afterwards yesterday my wife got excited while talking to her sister on the phone and shouted with joy the loud noise was so painful that i was incapacitated for hours until my medicine kicked in i have ptsd from the first few years of my migraine when no medicine helped its hard to remember that time of my life but when i can access the memories all they are is unspeakable pain the only way i made it through was by believing id get better one day but im not going to get better this is my life now i will never know another moment without pain and i will never be able to do the things i used to love i was a mountaineer and an accomplished martial artist the man i was is dead and i honestly dont know how to accept that i want to accept it but i dont know how i dont really know what im hoping to hear in response to this post maybe someone here knows how to mourn the death of your former self maybe i just need to type it out i should probably be talking to my wife about this but i dont want to upset her i know shed tell me that doesnt matter that she wants to be there for me fuck i wish i could have given her ra better man than me a man who isnt held down by so much pain and trauma i wish i didnt hate myself for being such a ruin i wish i could see myself how she sees me,post-pandemic
i go to a wondeful campus but my anxiety didnt want to leave my back ive tried to calm down and all but all i could think is if my smile is not crispy or why the organisators were looking at me so often one of the guide discuss with me when all the visit were done and i tried to made it cool just i joked about the price of a cake they offered and lets just say its not good idea to talk when you feel freewheeling i know it sound annoying but its not easy somtimes to dissociate your bad version to a decent one,post-pandemic
a bit over a year ago i saw a dead body on a school trip a trip consisting of 68 people i think we were on our way to learn about water energy and filtering and on our way to the on site class room we looked across the river running besides us and saw a dead body washed up we returned to school promptly the day after a police officer came to talk to us and just repeated everything we had heard before its not normal for you guys to see that im sorry as soon as we left we checked the local news and found articles about the incident and i do admit that was a move that i shouldnt have made but i was so curious and wanted to know who we found ever since that happened last december i have felt bleak i cant watch action films anymore just in case they show a dead body my friend that was with me sometimes brings it up around people if it somehow fits in the context of the conversation and it really upsets me because of course i dont want to remember it anyway not sure how or when i will recover so yay,post-pandemic
this is in the uk btw basically ive been struggling to recover from an eating disorder at home for about 4 months now i left inpatient in november after being there for 12 weeks and not being able to make a lot of progress this was due to a lot of things but things going on in my life mindset as well as not receiving enough or the right support on the ward were a big partive been trying to recover at home but this is also not going great as i dont have a lot of support at home and the community support isnt gr8 either i think im nearing the point of being admitted to hospital again but im so scared theyre going to section me they mentioned it a while ago when i was leaving the ward but i dont know if theyd consider doing it now ive been very open to my lead professional and my dietitian about my struggles and weight and i would be willing to comply with what they said if they wanna admit me to hospital and suggest i should go inpatient again i just really really dont want to be sectioned does anyone have any advice on how to avoid this its so hard to find a balance between admitting u need more help and also showing you can be safe enough to not need to be sectioned,post-pandemic

does anyone else have what i could only describe as a limited selection of topics that are actually subjects of your health anxiety like being debilitated by fear with one and then having nearly no abnormal reactions to another disease im a young healthy person so like many others here im terrified of cncer and invariably terminal diseases however as illogical as it is im almost totally unfased by the idea of getting specific types of it for example im terrified of getting melanoma or lymphoma and ive gone through very draining and stressful periods of trying to repeatedly reassure myself that im not in any danger but if i see a person talking about their brain tumor or leukemia diagnoses i can just confidently think yeah thats not going to happen to me and i just find it so weird the craziest part is that i have zero worries about my cardiac health even though my dad passed away from sudden heart disease in middle age one could link my health anxiety stemming from my dad dying abruptly but i personally find little correlation there,post-pandemic
hes only 28 at age 25 he told me he had liver cirrhosis but i think hes been downplaying everything when i ask him how its doing he says he gets it looked at every 6 months and that it hasnt grown he tells me its fine and he eats healthy now hes been admitted to rehab by the military which tells me his heavy drinking is affecting his professional life now hes only in treatment for 28 days and i feel like he needs longer time and more extensive care than that i want him to recover and get better but i know thats something he will have to realize and do on his own he says he doesnt need to be in rehab and that most of the guys there are depressed suicidal or anxious i saw him today for the first time in years he had a red blood spot on his eyeball and bruises on his face he says its from the seizures hes had called delirium tremens he says hes doing great and hasnt had any withdrawl symptoms ive personally witnessed him drink a 1 liter bottle of vodka in half a day when he was 22 ive seen him chug 3 amfs in one sitting he ordered one for home for myself and my sister and me and her barely drank ours so he didnt want to waste alcohol and drank it for us after a night out of heavy drinking ive seen him drink 2 beers first thing in the morning with breakfast he thinks hes invincible i tell him to be mindful of his health and his response is that he can buy health i wanted to tell him you cant buy immortality but i know itll be met with pushback we have a recovered alcoholic father his father was an alcoholic and died from cancer related to his drinking our moms dad also died from liver failure due to heavy drinking so theres definitely a genetic component to it my dads twin is also a recovered alcoholic of over 10 years my brother told me not to tell anyone about the liver cirrhosis but i confided in my uncle for guidance hes a facilitator for his aa program and helps guys who are new to aa and he told me not to confront him about any of it i know from dealing with my dads past drinking that you cant confront an alcoholic and that they have to want to heal on their own my brother is too young and has his whole life ahead of him he is a brilliant compassionate person with a big heart it hurts me to see him like this and i hope he can turn his life around before its too late our parents dont know hes in rehab or even back in the states hes been stationed overseas for the past 5 years and im the only person hes told i think the reason hes confided in me about all of this is because i dont overworry or blow things out of proportion like my parents do but this has really got me worried i dont want to over exaggerate but i think this is really serious and i want to help i just dont know how i want him to still talk and confide in me but i also want to show him i care and support him thanks for reading this far and ill take any advice i can get,post-pandemic

last year i came across fortune city a gamified expense tracker app while i like it overall i didnt like that it felt more like a game first and expense tracker second it also became paytoplay not long after using it fast forward to now i made my own minimalistic expense tracker app which has no ads i really hate the clutter existing apps have is free and has some gamification i understand the importance of mindful conscious spending to avoid overspending but forming the habit of tracking down expenses is not an easy feat especially for those with adhd thats why i added earning rewards in the app for some positive reinforcement i have many plans for the future of this app but id like to hear what you guys think about its early version so far i appreciate any feedback you might have its available on android for now,post-pandemic
had such a horrible night after nearly a year of not having social anxiety i had a massive flare up last night with some friends feel so embarrassed as i lost my confidence within a matter of hours the overall feeling was that i have to perform my jokes have to land and if they dont i criticise myself what is so strange is that the social anxiety only comes about when i see these friends the experience in itself is traumatic the worse experience is the shame that comes after it its almost making me consider having a break from seeing these friends as im already anxious i will have a flare up again it really sucks im sure other people have been going through similar experiences and hope you guys are okay if anyone has had a similar experience and want to let me know how you dealt with it would be much appreciated x200b,post-pandemic
so i am 36 m i have never had a girlfriend before i currently do not have any friends i guess the combination of being single and well friendless has led me to having solo hobbies my hobbies are music edibles literature philosophy movies things like that i of course do all these things at home and alone i am mostly a happy person so it is not like i need a girlfriend or i am forever miserable or anything like that if you are curious how i plan on meeting anyone to date well i am on several dating sites no luck yet but i am still trying i have not been on a date in about six years back then my hobbies were not so settled i guess i am worried that even if i get a date i will seem super boring and too much of a homebody for her i would love to get some opinions on this issue thank you,post-pandemic

at a young age i became hyperaware of the way people perceived me and the way people around me interacted with one another when i think back to the times i was more talkativeoutgoing i now realize i wasnt even being myself i was loud and made lots of jokes because i figured that was an easy way to get people to like me or if i could sense someone was annoyed with me id just play the persona up higher my intentions werent even to get further on their nerves but rather a defensive mechanism i conceptualized this by knowing that even if i was being seen as annoying at least i know it isnt the real me they find annoying at least im selfaware fast forward to now and ive stopped talking altogether im so nervous someone wont like me my brain goes blank if im being spoken to and i cant think of a word to say ironically enough i have this passion for acting that i decided to pursue a year ago ive been doing plays at school the process was rough but i pushed through because i enjoy the craft this semester im even taking an improv class in the hopes that i can learn how to get out of my head and stay present when talking to others as nervous as i am before i have to get on stage or when its my turn to go during improv class the nerves end as soon as i get into the scene and im in a flow state i say that to say that now i question if i even have social anxiety and if the problem is just my inability to connect with others if so how do i do this i noticed that majority of my life ive pushed things aside until i feel ready ie i still believe i wont be able to make genuine relationships until i look like my desired self weigh less dress better and take better care of myself this ideology is flawed i know but i cant shake it i havent made any new friendships since the pandemic i noticed that ive had countless opportunities to but i always end up pushing them away by never reaching out or making plans im so closed off and reserved but i dont want to be i feel so lonely right now and im seeking for connectioncommunity but i dont know what more i can do part of the answer may be to connect with myself first but i dont even know how to do that i feel like ive suppressed myself for so long that i forgot who i am,post-pandemic
i was raised by narc family members both my sister and my mom and when i look back at my childhood i was walking on egg shells as early as i can remember i know we were informed when we were diagnosed that bipolar is something youre born with but i dont believe that anymore i think environment plays a huge part in how these mental illnesses surface esp in our early 20s theres only so much stress a developing brain can handle and i now believe that if i grew up in a relatively normal household i wouldnt be having to deal with these mood swings and taking the pills im not complaining it is what is and you accept the cards youre dealt with but i always wondered what my life would be if i was never diagnosed lol,post-pandemic

i love my boyfriend very much we are planning on getting married next year last monday i had a weird feeling that something was up and got anxious before he left the house in the afternoon he shaved his pubes and showered and i immediately got suspicious but tried to calm myself down after he had left i texted him what he would do if somebody tried to flirt with him he said he wouldnt engage cause he would feel like micro cheating on me and got quite angry that i would even dare to ask he came home in the evening saying that he got hard today thinking of me and that there was a little precum stain in his underwear from that i found that highly unlikely and confusing and acuses him of lying he then got really angry blaming it on my low self esteem that i wouldnt even accept a compliment like that later that evening i asked him to go through his phone and found spicy messages of him and a girl i confronted him we fought he didnt admit at this point that they met in person only when i contacted her the next day i found out bit by bit that he was at this girls place and they had made out on her couch they did not have sex nor did they get naked he said she grinded on him and they kissed we have been fighting and discussing this over the last couple of days he got physically abusive and threw stuff around said hurtful things but i managed to stay calm and at some point we had a real deep talk about his past and his current behaviour he seemed really honest and regretful he also said that he tends to fuck up everything that means something to him and that i am the best thing that ever happened to him we said we would go to couples therapy and i signed us up yesterday i do love him very much but i am still shocked about the way he was able to lie to me to my face like that i told him from the beginning that being lied and cheated to is something i am very afraid of and we agreed that if we have the need to cheat we would talk about it beforehand that he broke our agreement like that is devastating my question to you is are there pwbpd that have successfully stopped cheating on their partners and how did they do it do you love your partners is there anything i can do to make him less likely to do it again should i just convince myself to let him cheat and open up the relationship i dont know what to do i have the constant need to talk about it and i still dont fully believe they didnt have sex or that this is the full story i would be very glad about any sort of advice cause i have no one to talk to,post-pandemic

the title pretty much sums it up if therapy helped you overcome sa or at least make good progress with it was there a certain exercise or point made by your therapist that really made an impact ive been to therapy 3 times once when i was around 13 i felt very uncomfortable and had a panic attack as soon as i left and never went back lol the second time i was 1617 and the therapist acted more like she was trying to be my life coach or something rather than actually focusing on my social anxiety and again when i was 18 but i went to a therapist who mostly worked with children and it all felt a bit childish every therapist ive been to doesnt seem to think much is wrong with me but i think thats because in that setting i feel comfortable speaking because i know what im there for and ultimately they have to ask all the questions so it makes them think that im okay when im not,post-pandemic

has anyone ended up having a bit if a crisis during emdr therapy therapy has made me reassess so many things and im very confused about who i am and what i want out of life now a big theme is that being a people pleaser has ended up with me being in lots of bad situations so im now reassessing my motives behind lots of things and relationships not sure if its this or if im self sabotaging somehow not sure if this is common or if im slowly going mad or both,post-pandemic
hello im not sure what im doing this is my first time on reddit lol i dont have a therapist or anything i hope to get one in the future because i really do need helppeople to talk to ive always felt lonely since i was young i never liked asking for help or talking about my negative feelings with other people i hate when people feel sorry for me it makes me even more sad when others look at me like im a victim theres so much to say and i dont even know where to begin i apologize for how messy this is typed im attempting to categorize my thoughts ive been okay this year made some new friends after the friend who i thought loved me as much as i loved them hurt me its a long story but i never really had a bestfriend except from when i was young i tried so hard with her and i never saw her in a negative light she felt like a sister i never really had but i found out this year that all of that was one sided and the entire time she judged and used me that really fucking got to me now my anxiety and sadness is through the roof and im scared to get close to anyone but at the same time i need friends i feel so lonely and i try so hard to be good to people but even that is not perfect but nothing ever is ive been bailing out on plans and avoiding them when i feel anxious i have this thing where i feel i need to be perfect otherwise i wont be liked and when i make a mistake for example a friend that i really like is upset with me for bailing out on multiple plans which is understandable i completely understand her feelings theyre all 100 valid no doubt about it but for some reason that mistake of mine is eating me up inside its making me so sad because i try so hard to make my friends feel heard and loved i dont want to lose anyone i need people and im willing to fix that about myself i just hope she can give me a chance to the fact is i need people more than they need me i love caring for people and making them feel good so when i fuck up or fail other people its like im fucking up and failing myself i try so hard but i still feel like im not trying enough i crave real connections and friends im so fucking sad i hope this all makes sense thank you for reading i just need to feel like im not the only one who is like this lol,post-pandemic
dv trigger warning sorry for the language in advance im very pissed at the moment of writing this very long story short im planning on moving again because of loud new neighbors with ongoing domestic violence itll be the 7th time having to deal with this source of trauma and im feeling pretty fucking cursed at this point the first several times involved people i loved and cared about so hearing these things through the walls have a severe negative effect on my mental stability i get so much fight or flight adrenaline each time another sudden sound goes off from the neighbors its actually becoming physically painful and my joints are also starting to kill me every day i feel like im on the verge of a heart attack and i can barely eat or sleep anymore its irrational but im starting to believe theres some sort of sick god or force that lulls me into a false sense of security for a while before it fucks with me again im literally conditioned to never relax because the moment i can finally safely say that ive recovered from the trauma another subhuman piece of shit shows up out of nowhere and the cycle begins again any strength i had in going through it the first 6 fucking times is pretty much chipped away and i sure as fuck wont be able to tolerate it one more time without losing my shit and doing something drastic the cops are essentially useless and literally laughed at me once but thats another long story and im debating talking to the landlord right now since the last apartment i tried that with i got subtle threats from the neighbor that i couldnt get proof of despite trying to be anonymous its also illegal for me to record anything to get proof so thats fantastic the only option i have left is to leave another place i called home and let yet another cunting trashy waste of space fuckheaded piece of shit parasite invade and claim my peaceful space i found the perfect apartment in every aspect but of course this has to happen anyways if i could get a recommendation for quality noise canceling headphones that would be great i basically have dogs ears and my hearing is insanely sensitive so i would need nothing less than the best ill pay whatever i need to i have a fan and loud podcasts for white noise to take a bit of the edge off in the meantime thanks ahead for reading and possibly sharing any advice,post-pandemic

hi everyone my gf has been struggling with her body image a lot lately she hasnt got an ed but shes definitely engaged in disordered eating despite having an ed for years and now being pretty much recovered i feel like i have no clue how to help im not sure that i can do much shes respectful of me given my history most of the time but when she gets really selfconscious and upset she tends to compare the two of us as well as asking me questions that are difficult to answer i feel like my view of bodies could be skewed so i tend to answer her questions vaguely as to not make her feel worse i want to help her as best i can although it breaks my heart the way she makes these comparisons and talks badly about herself any advice is appreciated,post-pandemic
my support worker was on holiday last week when my depo was due i assured her i would remember to go to the drop in clinic to have it done but forgot about it and then when i remembered felt too anxious about going there alone my husband would normally go with me but is away at the moment because ive been hospitalized there a few times and find the environment quite triggering so im about a week overdue problem is i feel better than i have done in months and dont really want to go and get it now when everything seems to be alright the very mild depression and anxietyagoraphobia i was suffering from for a few months seems to have lifted and ive not noticed any uptick in symptoms im kind of tempted to carry on and see how i get on without it i have oral medication olanzapine and aripiprazole that i can take if things start to head south im quite selfaware of my symptoms these days and quite good at recognizing them for what they are when they do emerge but feel like i want to skip the depo for now and see how things go question is if i do this do they have any power to hospitalize me purely on the basis that ive skipped my depo the last thing i want is to end up banged up again,post-pandemic
im not sure if this is allowed here but i really need the advice my husband 24m unfortunately has a severe addiction to alcahol me 21 f has tried everything i can think of to help him like reducing how much he drinks therapy or just even just visiting the doctors to see how they can help he always says no for a little background info about him he went through alot of family trauma controlling parents causing minor ptsd such events being physically abusive he suffers with bipolar disorder and anger issues addictiondependency runs in the family i myself unfortunately suffer from bpd so situations like this are really hard for me my birth mother was also an alcaholic but my father left her and took me and my sister with him so i never really delt with it trying to talk to my dad about these past situations with my mother he tends to shut them down i try to talk to him about how im concerned about how much he drinks and say for example he drinks a litre bottle of vodka and he will start drinking from 10pm at night till 7 in the morning and then go to work and do the same thing when he comes home i suggest if there is there any way we can reduce it to maybe the 750ml bottle and then the smaller one and cut back and back till its ok but he says they dont give him the same feelings he knows hes an alcaholic and doesnt want to do anything about it using the facts that he has to deal with his past and his job and he just wants to feel numb and all the pain to go away he shuts me off and it ends up in him getting angry saying horrible things to me and then it leads to an angry argument i just really dont know what i can do to help i love the man so much and i dont want to loose him over it so if you can give me any advice on how to help him or even suggest things i can do that would be amazing ps sorry if i ramble too much im not used to posting my thoughts and feelings on reddit,post-pandemic

i have a crippling pornaddiction and lots of other stuff and it has made me suicidal how do i get my life back note i come from a thirdworld country and english is not my first language despite how well i write it please keep in mind not to suggest things that might not be available in countries such as mine the thing with my 17m porn addiction is that it directly takes root from my sexual trauma due to csa that happened to me twice at the of eight by different people the first abuser did stuff to me over a course of two months where they used to feminise me and use my body and the other one was done by an uncle who gave me fellatio and forced me into it too one of my abusers introduced me to porn when i was 8 and it stuck to me everything about my sexuality and my identity was destroyed due to my csa it left me damaged as an individual and i experienced gender and body dysmorphia due to one of my abuser feminising my body calling my chubby body out and sexualising its meatiness for femininity and softness due to being choked and getting my penis touched getting my chest stimulated and getting my ass grabbed i developed a weird sensitivity around these areas and even the slightest of contact still turns me on im extremely horny all the time and really hypersexual i know this is probably tmi i dont even know why im making this post but i need to share this somewhere i started masturbating at a really young age and my fantasies kept worsening after that ive been a porn addict since i was about 10 this addiction made me severely mentally unstable as a child expecting sex to be very gratifying and i masturbated a lot by the age of 12 i was already watching the most taboo porn categories to exist because the craze for the next worst thing was maddeningly hot to me i used to introduce my cousins and friends and neighbours to porn and i even used to form groups as we all watched it my younger years had me so rotten due to this addiction that it was my form of pass time as opposed to youtube or sports or video games this obviously led to me being a degenerate and i severely struggled to talk to girls or boys for that matter i sexualised genatalia in my head and though i think im pansexual im not too sure as im only attracted to women but something about penises as being part of my only sexual experience has left me somewhat confused about whether im truly pansexual or just have a sexualised view of genitals i eventually got into worse and worse stuff listening for hours to no end to hypnotic videos telling me im not a man sissy hypno and i kid you not that shit works my sexual trauma mightve aided in it working but i started to sexualise gender transformation too and crossdressing theres still nothing that turns me off ive went on dark web and forums searching for worse and worse media and its not good for me i stopped after realising most of it was illegal but its definitely scarred me i dream about my abusers a lot when im asleep and it leaves me distraught theyre a distant memory now of events that happened almost a decade ago but it still haunts me to this day and sometimes turns me on i imagine getting raped tortured and all of the worst stuff fills my brain and its a turn on for me yet this level of masochism is still never enough for me no matter what i know its a result of my trauma and though i can soundly say my thoughts are not me but my trauma speaking i still find myself thinking ill never get better about being ugly about not having someone wholl love me ever still being a virgin and having never touched a girl not even held hands with one despite how much i am attracted to them doesnt help either its almost as though i convince myself at times that no one will ever like me my hypersexuality often makes me irrevocably horny when i was 14 i remember being alone at home one day not sleeping and masturbating a whole of fourteen times in 24 hours i suck at building relationships drive people away and betray their trusts sometimes get too in my head and act compulsively damaging everything and everyones perceptions of me that ive faked for them on the surface i am smart i have a high iq too 135 and ive got a creative brain ive got passions ive got things to look forward to but deep down i have no love in my life my brains always distracted i suspect having adhd but selfdiagnosis is no good despite the courses i took on psychology to understand myself better i always searched for love in friends family lovers but friends always left father was abusive mother was mostly an enabler and lovers were people i met online thousands of miles away my first online girlfriend ghosted me the second one cheated on me that shattered me too i want to pursue medicine but im not good at chemistry haha our high school teacher sucked at teaching chemistry because my school was cheap as shit that couldnt accomodate good teachers third world go figure so teachers without qualifications taught us most of the subjects and chemistry is something ill have to be good at if i want to pursue medicine so im not going to try med school and as i said i probably have adhd so anything that doesnt interest me usually fails to even be something i feel like studying i just end up procrastinating for days i was always more into psychiatry and psychology though so i have been considering bs in psychology for college and to then go on for masters abroad hopefully if that plan succeeds i seriously doubt it will i might become a psychologist one day to help people like myself pipe dreams eh my father ks against that too they believe psychology is a stupid field and ill be wasting my life going that route getting into med school is tough in my country if you want it to be affordable and were not rich at all so he wants me to do something he chooses for me ive directed a documentary before and even filmmaking was something i considered pursuing but my parents shat all over that too my dad is a control freak and extremely abusive to this day and my mom just enables him by not defending me until she believes that hes hit me enough he usually gets especially abusive when it comes to my choices not being to his liking this can be as little of a choice as a hairstyle or as big as my career he micromanages and controls everything ive been beaten since i was three and now im almost eighteen hes beaten me to the point of me throwing up concussions bruises and even more i havent let him do the same to my younger brother so im kind of proud that i could be the disabler of his abuse for my brother ive seen him abuse alcohol and smoke ciggerates enough as a child to be repulsed by it so luckily i never fucked myself up with that shit im also chronically ill over everything else nothing serious just chronic migraines chronic bronchitis and they have significantly limited my lifes normal functioning though i also have a dislocated wrist that my father never got treated because he thought i was overexaggerating it now its a hindrance in my daily activities and i cant even write for long periods so now im left here with cptsd a crippling porn addiction chronic illnesses suicidal ideation lack of direction in life lack of love and support and friends inability to concentrate probably adhd and it just feels like all is lost i know this isnt my fault for those who are about to preach that i know my trauma makes me speak lots of stuff about myself thats not entirely true ive studied psychology so i know about all that trust me i just wish life couldve been easier i contemplate suicide a lot i cant commit to it because im scared of death and pain but i have my reasons now to give up these reasons being that my only hope

i dont know if i have bpd but i know for a fact that much of what ive read deeply resonates with me i stayed up until 4 in the morning reading all that i could and i finally felt like i had a reason for the mood swings for the overwhelming waves of loneliness for the feeling that i didnt matter because im hardly a person anyways for the times in my life when i felt so lucid and in control that i never thought my demons would come back only for them to completely run me and my life as soon as i felt scared that i wasnt enough i felt so excited to tell my boyfriend this morning he had already asked to come see me the day before so i was looking forward to talking about it with him more but hed been distant the past week ever since my birthday when i kicked him out of my apartment and argued with him over text about some bullshit i cant even remember i knew in my gut he was preparing to break up with me but after finding this subreddit i tried so hard to convince myself that i was just being paranoid that he still loves me and wants to be with me and im finding excuses again to think hes abandoning me and then he broke up with me some hours later we work together so he couldnt do it earlier i read many stories of people overcoming bpd but i just feel so hopeless right now that everything i touch turns to shit he was my only friend left that i hadnt pushed away and now i have no one he says he wants to be there for me still as a friend and we actually hung out for hours after i knew it would have been normal to want space after but i was afraid having space would mean id just spiral and i didnt want to kick him out again in a fit of anger and he wanted to stay i think he truly wanted to spend time together not just out of pity or to make sure i didnt selfharm but i never know what feeling to trust i feel like im always trying to stop myself from hurting others and i always fuck up anyways and hurt everyone around me well cheers to the beginning of the shitty path to self discovery,post-pandemic
does anyone randomly get a wave of dizziness its like sudden disorientation that lasts a couple seconds i feel like im healing my anxiety and feeling good and then this happens and makes my panic go through the roof its so depressing,post-pandemic
anybody else have absolutely awful emotional permanence if you dont know what that means heres a definition emotional permanence is when you can maintain certainty that your partner or other loved ones cares about you even when you are not in their presence or when they are not actively telling you that they care about you i have like absolutely no ability to do that with my current fp he can reassure me he can send me some sweet message or we can spend actual physical time together in which he says a lot of nice things and says he likes me and all that but almost immediately afterwards i start to overthink start to doubt start to get paranoid wonder if hes lying if he actually hates me and thinks im annoying if hes playing some sick game where hes typing these things to me but actually laughing behind the screen at me believing in it etc sometimes if im in an especially ok mental state and if his words were especially romantic and sweet i might be able to survive like 12 maybe even 3 days of nolow contact and still keep believing that he likes me and im not annoying to ensure this i usually have to keep going back to the messages either in the chat itself or in my screenshots thats another thing i have to screenshot every single like especially sweet message which made me really happy so i can go back and keep reading it and reassuring myself it happened and it was real and he said that and keep rereading it and keep trying to remember how i felt when i read it for the first time which is generally giddy and very happy or i have to try to close my eyes and remember him telling me something he told me directly or try to imagine looking into his eyes or how his touch felt or something i have to try to bring myself back to the moment itself and how i felt then but heres another catch my memories are always so foggy and distant and weird ive seen some people refer to this as dissociation but idk if thats what it is but even like the literal next day or a couple of days after something happens it feels so far away and distant like it happened a month or two ago or it happened to somebody else or im imagining it or i saw it in a movie or something i literally hung out with my fp a couple of days ago and it already feels so far away and i am desperately mentally grasping at the memory trying to hold on to how his touch felt and his voice sounded and what sort of things we talked about but its already slipping away this makes the emotional permanence so much harder a normal person like him is probably still happy from that day and still ok and feeling like we spent time together recently but it feels like we didnt meet for like a month to me already and im already wondering if he actually hates me and thinks im annoying or if i said anything wrong or acted weird or whatever sorry this was long anybody else dealing with this or have tips for how to stop obsessing over this and how to improve my emotional permanence,post-pandemic

while typing this out feeling a mix of hope and vulnerability its late and in moments like these i cant help but wish i had someone to talk tonot just small talk cause yourebored but a real meaningful conversation im that person whos always there for everyone else no matter the time of day 3 am no problem but finding someone who offers the same it feels like searching for a needle in a haystack are you someone who gets that life is messy and complicated but is ready to ride through it together someone who sees beyond the usual stuff like what we look like or where we come from im talking about a bond thats built on understanding mutual respect and genuine care i know this might sound desperate maybe it is but isnt there a kind of beauty in admitting we need each other in a world thats always rushing im here reaching out for something real i miss having that person who i can laugh with over silly jokes share my weirdest thoughts with or just sit in silence without it being awkward maybe this is all just a fairy tale thought and the modern world is messed up beyond repair for anything like this,post-pandemic
1 you need to chance it this is the big deal this is the thing i cant say for certain that there is nothing wrong with you physically no one can and i know what you feel what if there is something what if i convince myself ive got anxiety now only to end up with a morbid disease wont i feel much worse the thing is there is no way of knowing that for certain though of course the chances are very low the chances are if you are here now cleared of all those medical tests and such the only thing that is pathological about you is anxiety anxiety is a pathalogical liar however you will never heal from anxiety if you dont ever chance it and live your life in constant fear and dread and panic you know this no matter what this is just no way to live you have got to chance it despite physical symptoms despite everything chance it now and go along with it physical symptoms wont just go away but you have to keep telling yourself that you have just got anxiety if you are ever to recover from this 2 start doing something you enjoy i cant stress this enough anxiety is a way of our brains to say hey you are important too you have got to give yourself some time every day to do something you enjoy doing watch movies play computer games whatever you will just forget about this irrational feeling that is anxiety and in time you will see how silly it was of you to feel that way 3 start exercising one of the things that made a lot of difference in my case was exercise i enrolled in a gym and went every day except sundays i would feel the anxiety literally vanish as i ran on the treadmill exercise is how you banish anxiety it just vanishes all of a sudden even though for a short time 4 meds help this is a sensitive subject but if you are prescribed medicine be sure to use them as your doctor described it might take some weeks and even months for them to take effect they can make it easier for you to deal with anxiety meds help but they dont cure they help a lot though they can make you see things more rationally 5 start therapy start paying a therapist instead of a physician for myself cbt helped me to such an extent that it became a part of my life it helped me see hiw irrational and negative i have been i now look back and only feel silly for having such heightened levels of anxiety now i am no longer frightened and live my life confidently i owe it to therapy,post-pandemic

hey everyone im not sure if this is allowed so mods please take down if deemed inappropriate for this sub but i wanted to share a short film i wrote and directed that is very close to my heart and may resonate with some in this community that being said this film is not pleasant and it is not hopeful but it is honest and those who have seen it and who dont have ha have told me for the first time i can start to understand what youre going through x200b watch here tw please only watch if you feel like youre in a good place mentally the film follows a man who discovers a bump on the back of his head and spirals into madness as someone who deals day to day with ocd specifically with ha and emetephobia i always struggled to properly explain what my struggle really felt like this film is an exploration of what my anxiety and intrusive thoughts feel like invisible illnesses like anxiety depression and ocd are so hard to properly explain to someone whos never experienced it so i wanted to explore it in a visual and tangible experience that i believe is what film as an art form and storytelling tool achieves best i have never seen a realistic depiction of what my mental health issues feel like especially health anxiety and so my goal with this film was to show the rawest and most realistic portrayal of it that i could being able to present these inner demons that myself and many others battle every day and make them digestible so that anyone could experience how debilitating and uncomfortable it is to go through can maybehopefully challenge the way we talk about these things in a way this film is a release of all the thoughts and feelings ive had and have struggled with its been therapeutic to let it out to create a worst case scenario as a reminder to myself how ridiculous it looks when you take a step back from your own inner turmoil and reflect i feel better having made it if please check it out if you have 14 minutes to spare i hope you enjoy it and feel something by it,post-pandemic

ive had this trait forever for no apparent reason places make me randomly anxious even my own city makes me feel sick with anxiety so its not like its a fear of new places im currently in reykjavik i dont feel anxious now but most of the day i did its not ruined my day im still having the best time just with a sick feeling all day i felt anxious but its nothing i can pinpoint its always been this way last year i went to london and york cities in my country and even then i felt so anxious also been to places like disneyland spain turkey etc in the past and experienced the same thing every time how does someone even feel anxious in a place like disneyland i dont know if its the world in general that freaks me out i still love to travel and still have fun wherever i go but i wish i could do it without feeling so anxiousscared over nothing what even causes this its not social anxiety its nothing to do with the places i choose to go it isnt because its new there doesnt seem to be any rationality behind it and im just tired of it,post-pandemic
hi this is going to be a bit of a rant but also asking for advice sorry its a bit long throughout my life ive had hyperfixations that last for usually at least a year or two usually a certain video game or tv or book series but after it dies out i want nothing to do with the topic anymore like ive completely exhausted myself from the topic its like eating the same food for a year straight and then later gagging when someone offers that food to you anyway i suppose where im going with this is i dont want this to happen anymore i obviously really love these things that i get fixated on and i dont want to be exhausted from them the problem is when im hyperfixated on a fandom everything i do is about it i talk about it buy merch about it make artwork and crafts do research on it etc etc its a bit ridiculous lol so any time i have a hyperfixation i like to make at least one cosplaycostume for a character in that fandom my current hyperfixation started only a couple weeks ago its something ive been into as a kid but its come back even stronger this time lol and ive started making a cosplay for it ive started gathering materials and making a mockup pattern for the cosplay right now im really enjoying myself but im afraid ill go too far and get exhausted from the topic but ive discovered if i have nothing to dohyperfixate on i get really depressed because i dont know what to do with myself lol im sorry i suppose im just wondering in my specific scenario how can i try to better manage my interest so that it doesnt occupy my brain all the flipping time because i really enjoy doing this thing but i know if i go for too long ill regret it help,post-pandemic
me and k been friends for 3 years now we started off as friends online because we dont live in same city and we slowly got closer as best friends always talk share about our cats phone calls to be honest as first i always took the vibe that he is interested and want something more than friendship when i asked him and i about it he said hes not looking for a relationship right now and he like our friendship as it is this time i didnt have feelings for him but then i moved to his city to have my clinical training as a dentist in a university there thats when i got to know him we met for the first time it was two months we went out more than once thats when i started to develop feelings for him i didnt talk about it tell him because i know hes not feeling the same the day i was returning to my city we talked and he told me he is not okay and i asked why he told me about this girl hes been seeing for weeks and something happened between them and theyre not talking anymore i didnt tell him anything and i supported him as a friend until i couldnt take it anymore and i told him i want my space and i dont wanna talk because it was so uncomfortable having you talk about being with someone else he apologised he didnt know that i was feeling that way and he gave me space i realised the friendship was important to me so after five days i called him and we talked and he told me that he knew that our friendship would need something for me and i would not give up on it then between the words he told me i i felt it this one time you told me you like talking to me and i was like me too but i felt too intimately more than friends when i look back at it that happened during the two months i was in the city before he dated i knew i had feelings for him after we talked for a month then my mental has went down i relapsed because of all of this and i asked for his help to find a new therapist at that time he knew i was not okay then he told me he came to my city for a birthday party he told me he wouldnt be able to see me that night he posted pictures with a girl and they were close and intimate i think she is the girl he was talking about and they got back together i didnt ask but i started to distance myself and only like his message if he sent me meme of something we are used to this until his birthday i sent him happy birthday he told me thank you amy thats the last time we talked and i waited for him to talk to me or make an approach he didnt thats when i felt betrayed and abandoned and that no one hold close to me they all let me go easily until this february it was my birthday he sent me a text happy birthday i wish you have a good happy day before the day of my birthday thats when i realised he really thought about me maybe it was all in my mind i was hurt so i just distanced myself but he always wanted to talk but its because of me he stopped because i distant myself now i want to talk to him because i have no friends he was my only close friend i accepted the fact that we will not be together and i deserve someone who feel the same way about me i just want him as a friend have my company he knows that i have bpd and most of my friends because they decided to distance away and spent months without talking to me he knows i have an issue abandonment issues to people and he once told me friend wouldnt be your friend if they didnt ask about you and he did the same i have this problem people walking away from my life since i was 16 my friends drift away but i never know why maybe its because of my bdp so now i wanna know why and i wanna save their friendship if it could be saved should i text him or will it lower my standards and my selfrespect i dont know im so confused what should i do,post-pandemic

i stopped taking my medication a few weeks ago and its starting to catch up to me im having a lot more flashbacks again and dissociation has been so bad nightmares jumpiness mood swings anxiety and depression everything is coming back i originally stopped taking my meds because i wanted to prove to myself that i didnt need substances to cope it makes me feel weak to think that i cant even handle my own brain without added chemicals im still young 19 and dont want to have to depend on anything for the rest of my life i know thats an incorrect way of thinking and medications can be wildly helpful for so many different reasons but ive been on them for years now and i just got sick of it also they kinda made me feel zombieish like i couldnt fully feel my emotions i want to prove to myself that i can live happily without assistance that i am stronger than my trauma but god its so hard most of what i think about now is my trauma i constantly am second guessing if what happened to me actually happened or not i constantly feel like crying in the past year or so ive resorted to substances to numb the memories out nothing extremely hard mostly just weed and even that is starting to not work my actual life is good right now for the first time in years and it makes me angry that i cant even fully enjoy it sure there are good days good moments but theres always that lingering knowledge of what happened to me is it dumb of me to stop my medication is it even possible for me to live comfortably without it and if so how can i achieve that on my own thank you for taking the time to read this,post-pandemic
so i saw a doctor feelgood from last january until june i came in because my previous doctor took me off of oxycontin 6 months before and only had me on less than half the amount of ir oxycodone that covered what the combination of ir oxycodone and oxycontin was giving so it put me straight into withdrawals i told them that im not coping not sleeping they didnt care theyd continue tapering this new doctor put me back on what they put me on at the start and temazepam for sleep for several weeks instead of the oxycontin i said isnt it bad to be on two benzodiazepines she said no and that plenty of her patients were on multiple benzodiazepines i told her that i wanted to be on the temazepam for the shortest amount of time and hopefully get back on my oxycontin eventually i did then she put me on a 12mcghr fentanyl patch and initially the pain relief was amazing this was at the end of march then she gave me liquid oxycodone too then in may before my exams she abruptly stopped seeing me no gp would see me so i went through 4 days of withdrawals from fentanyl she put me on 40mg oxycodone and it did nothing i was in such a bad way that i couldnt work and i had my exams coming up within days so i had to see an addiction doctor he forced her to continue prescribing the fentanyl patches and oxycodone and everything but he diagnosed me with oud so i was declared an addict because she put me on that crap i had to wait until there was a detox bed available to initiate me into sublocade which is actually the best painkiller ive ever had ive never back pain ever since but as a result ive lost my psychiatrist he discharged me when i went into the psyche ward twice despite still being administered my adhd medication because i was in hospital for a combined long time i had 150 tablets left and was given another 84 upon discharge that lasted me until the 25th of january but i shouldve not taken them until uni started my new gp rewrote a referral to my psychiatrist saying that he cant just do this to me and to represcribe my medication asap but ive heard nothing the psychiatrist wants me to see an addiction psychiatrist whats the difference i just need my meds or my grades will tank i start university in 2 weeks the whole system is just garbage my reputation has been destroyed i hate being an addict,post-pandemic

heya i wanna begin by saying that this is a throwaway as i dont want to reveal all this on my main account im 17 going to turn 18 in about 6 months ive been struggling on and off since i was 13 with addiction to drugs initially it started with me taking my fathers alprazolam xanax when i was around 13 of course he did not know along with his marijuana alongside dxm use when i could get it i was going through a pretty rough time because my parents had just divorced i lived with my father alone and we were dirt when we got through paying for the essentials i had felt that because of my circumstances i should take drugs this simply was because this was the pattern i observed from others and as a 13 year old who wanted to be like everybody else i decided that i should do this too the first drug i ever took was 2mg of xanax at age 1213 dont remember specifically that i had taken from my fathers medicine i fell in love with it over time from 1215 i did various drugs off and on namely xanax dxm weed and i believe klonopin one time maybe it was because of my limited access to these drugs but for some reason i always kept a habit of not redosing and waiting inbetween dosages i was relatively responsible this i think is because even at 12 i forced myself to do at least 3 days of research into what i was going to be taking before i took it so i had already learned about the principles of safety when it came to drugs x200b anyway right now is what im concerned about im 17 now and for some reason my care about my own safety and habitual use has just disappeared i just feel confused i really cant remember when i started to seriously get addicted to generally substances in general but i think it was about 4 months ago i now have the mentality of ill take whatever fucks me up and i feel like im just watching myself do these things i got my hands on 1mg of xanax again recently and i took it and for 4 days straight after i could only think about how much i wanted to get more xanax how nice it would be for me to be able to have that every day and be in that reality every day i think a lot of my addiction to substances in general is coming from that i just dont like reality i dont know why i have a hard time putting a reason to it but i know that every time after i use something that feeling of discontent with reality just grows and grows when im sober im very clearheaded and relatively upbeat but for the past 4 months almost everyday my brain has felt foggy i feel sick almost everyday that ive just gotten used to it all i can think about a lot of days is drugs where can i get the money for my next drugs what could fuck me up the most should i combine x and y fuck i hate what im becoming and its really scaring me x200b my main concern is that ive just lost care for everything its been really hard for me to even care about my drug use and generally anything i just feel lethargic all day i just want to lay in bed and be high and not be in reality anymore i stopped caring if i got addicted and thats the scariest thing to me i know that if i continue down this road i will die but i dont know what to do its fucking horrifying man none of my family knows i manage to keep a relatively wellkept profile on the outside and most people consider me to just be pretty normal but im scared man,post-pandemic

i know it probably seems kinda silly to still be saddened by a childhood prank phone call after all these years but its more than just that ill explain what i mean more in a little while but imma tell the story first so when we were around 1011 my cousin and i talked to each other using the pinger app im not really sure if people still use pinger so ill explain what it is its like a texting app and you can buy minutes for phone calls or watch ads to get free minutes anyway my cousin and i always budded heads a little bit as kids but we had really bonded during this time period and for a little while pinger was kind of important to us so one day i sent him essentially what was a cringy meme i made and i was really selfconscious about it because he hadnt said anything little did i know the reason why he wasnt responding had nothing to do with my meme his friend was over actually i think it might have been another cousin on his moms side but to keep it simple friend i forgot what led up to it but for some reason his friend called me on pinger pretending to be my cousin and was also using a fake english accent the first thing i noticed was the english accent i thought it was really weird my cousin wasnt the type of person to use a fake english accent but i didnt want to judge him so i ignored it good natured undiagnosed autistic me had absolutely no idea they were fucking with me so i started to apologize for my stupid meme and they both started laughing hysterically the friend started to make fun of me for not realizing it wasnt my cousin and not questioning the english accent i felt really badly and i had to face them both later that day because there was a birthday party or something i dont really remember later that day i remember being happy the friend was being nice to me not realizing back then it wasnt real and they were only being nice so they wouldnt get in trouble it hurts now realizing the whole joke was basically that im autistic so i wouldnt realize that they were fucking with me it wasnt like haha i got you good it was haha youre so stupid and gullible for not understanding stuff like this has happened over and over again now and it really breaks your spirit on top of that i was in similar dynamics through my whole adolescence where id legitimately be friends with someone but then someone more cool would befriend them who didnt like me and then all of a sudden my friend would start bullying me even outside of that dynamic that ive weirdly been in multiple times im always the joke now that im an adult i can see how these things have legitimately mentally damaged me over time,post-pandemic

last spring things were going good and i started to do more with my life not a lot more more but im just reviewing what happened then in june some of my relationships fell apart and i gave up on my new hobbies i was depressed and suicidal july august and september then i made some friends at a group therapy i went to in september that honestly just felt bad for me i was still suicidal in october and november then in december things started to go well again i stopped having constant suicidal thoughts they almost seemed crazy in retrospect sometime in january i decided i had to lose weight because i reached a height of 268 lbs and i did i found it very easy at first i fell to almost 250 and kept going then the relationships that i had built in group therapy fell apart sometime in february i started to lose motivation to exercise everyday i would say by valentines day but i knew something was up earlier but im always insecure so i wrote it off for a week or two but this week it fell apart i felt no motivation i started binge eating to deal with a rising sense of stress i felt like something was wrong with me but it turns out i was right to be stressed as today it was confirmed that those relationships i formed in september are pretty much falling apart i tried but im trapped i have autism so long as im under its curse ill never really have a good reason to do anything its difficult to force yourself to go on a run especially when your over 250 lbs when youre thinking about killing yourself on wednesday or thursday i can do it either of those days although the smart thing would be to wait till next week personal reasons i cant get into it itll depend on how badly my personal relationships are doing,post-pandemic

ive been with this man for 3 years and we are now 28 when i first met him he was holding down a good swe job doing okay with his finances so i didnt realize that his drug use was alarming also because im from a country that doesnt have hard drugs so i naively believed since he still had a job the drug use was just fun i realized after a while that taking 20 dabs a day 7 lines of ketamine at a time snorting adderall every day just to be able to do 1 hour of work and drinking to the point of blackout every other day is not normal fast forward to now over the past year ive watched him lose his job and struggle to find another one for a year and 3 months despite having an electrical engineering degree from a top ivy league and all the resources at his disposal i watched him get a barback job and fall into using cocaine and adderall just to stay up at the job he started drinking more and more i would find bottles of whiskey 1l empty within a couple days any time things didnt feel good he would do drugs and i realized he was also hiding how much ketamine he was doing i tried again and again to help him be soberhe would cry to me that he wants to be sober and i tried to get him to wake up early and apply to jobs eat healthy take vitamins and get his life together but every time id end up crying because he disappeared for 16 hours yet again because of this hes beeninhumanely cruel to me hes gone between telling me he loves me and im the only oneto me finding out he was cheating again this weekend when i confronted him he did not open his door and actually seduced the other girl while i was standing right outside sobbing it wasto say the least the most cruel and awful thing i have ever endured so i contacted his mom knowing hed be mad at me about this bc they dont have a good relationship i didnt know what else to do i told her her son is not okay and he really needs help either rehab or form his family bc i cant help him anymore then after 3 days of no response at all he returned saying that he wanted to explain the cheating but now he cant because i did the irreversible egregious act of telling his mom he never apologized for cheating and destroying me and even said he only cheated bc he was triggered by a german guy that reminded me of a guy you slept with once when we werent together he says he has no choice but to end it since i told his parents and they will take him out of the will if he continues to see me i feel so guilty i feel like i did the worst thingi cant stop crying wondering did i go too far maybe i should have tried to get him into aa first maybe his addiction isnt as bad as i thought i have so many doubts and guilt am i the asshole for telling his mom so she could help get him sober,post-pandemic

m 23 i have ptsd due to being sexually abused as a child i started applying ancient philosophy in my life in late 2021 and had a spiritual awakening by mid 2022 and it lasted a for 3 months circa basically all i did was studying a podcast that teaches ancient middle eastern and asian philosophy and use those teachings in my life doing martial arts definitely helped my achievements it was a great experience and im thankful for that while i was awakened i didnt had any ptsd symptoms and i felt i could achieve everything i had in mind for example i could almost see someone who was literally behind me im pretty sure i could see myself in third person just like in a videogame but from the top of my head i could recognize immediately if someone was lying to me just like neo in matrix i could notice more stuff that i wouldnt notice normally body language facial expressions ecc my memory was better i felt more connected to nature around me i could heal other people that were sickit was very risky tho because it would take a lot of energy physically mentally and emotionally stronger great reflexes feeling like heaven on earth these experiences are pretty much what i felt during my awakening as i said it didnt last much timethree months and there is also a dark side that it would be irresponsible and criminal for me not to warn you during my awakening i worked in a sect or a cult of course they didnt told me that they were a fucking cult they hire me to do a life threatening job as a goldsmith and while i worked there 6 months they actively tried to gaslight me they would mostly accuse me of things that they didits a ritual that every new member must receive could you imagine like a hundred of people that are committed to lie and deceive you in the sixth month working there they sent cars in front of my home the cars ran towards me like they were about to crash or something after that i just left and tried to find another job six months after leaving that job an autobus from another country purposely tried to run me over and the only reason i survived is that i still had reflexes from my spiritual awakening unfortunately after that incidenteight months ago i never felt awakened again do i suggest people to be awakened just like i did my answer is literally i dont know i dont know if its worth it as im still on my journey the only thing i would like is that people should start to understand is that these feelings and experiences do exist and everyone should be able to choose to be awakened or not this is my story if youd like to hear about the ancient middle eastern and asian philosophy just dm me and ill send you a link for the podcast thx for reading edit awakening is basically balancing your left and your right side of the brain and after that be automatically able to connecting it to your heart,post-pandemic

so im a seventeen your old male and i dont think im bad looking or anything im not that shy i have asked girls out before and gotten rejected the only affection i was ever given was by my mother for a while after my father left then after that when i was about 10 i would get my clothes in my closet and hugged them as i fell asleep just so i could maybe see what it felt like to receive physical affection from someone this lasted for 3 years after that when i was 13 and depressed i tried to kill myself my mother found my unconscious body i woke up in the er with blood loss i was put on suicide watch for a while and got out when i was around 14 from 1416 i tried to ask girls out and it never really went farther than that and nothing really feels real anymore and i attempted suicide again at 16 and im here now alive for now with the only physical affection i remember being a couple hugs from my mother i feel so deprived of it i dont think i could actually enjoy it if it did happen,post-pandemic

i was wondering for those of us who struggle with social anxiety whats your feeling about embracing our reflective natureintrospective side as an asset in building our confidence in social settings i think because of our tendency to overthink things this is an understatement our way of connecting with others is really unique and strategic you could say we tend to listen more than we actually talk and i think because people see confidence as synonymous with extroversion being more talkative and outgoing something is just wrong dont you think i mean as a communication student right this is one of the things i am currently pursuing despite knowing my weakness ive learned that effective communication happens when we listen more sounds familiar to me i listen all the time even very conscious of my thoughts and actions my thought right now is if we are that kind of listeners if we just learn to embrace rather than seeing that reflective nature as something we need to overcome once we are able to do that wont we be the best communicators out there i really think people like us are the best at forming deep true relationships and pursuing our passions you could say we are the untrained an unpolished communicators what do you think,post-pandemic

hi all im new here but not new to the health anxiety problem as i grow older ive become aware of my increasing ability to actually cause myself physical pain and to put a stop to it with my thoughts its a rather strange phenomenon i thought id share some tricks if you start having something like chest pains try and associate it to something external i have a thing where if i notice chest pains i imagine that my smartphone is causing it via rf radiation i then turn on airplane mode or walk away from my phone and the pain pretty much goes away immediately this works only because im by nature a paranoid person so the whole rf radiation thing is plausible on some level and could actually be true that last part is exactly why this trick works you need to believe it,post-pandemic
i have a nagging feeling that im not serious enough to need hospitalization if im in my right mind i wont commit but i have moments where it feels like a rabid animal suddenly has control over me and all it wants to do is kill me im worried that i just want to be taken care of like a kid trying to get out of school by faking sick besides if it doesnt fix my suicidal ideation then ill have wasted more money than i can justify it would also mean telling someone other than my therapist that i desperately wish i was dead i dont know what to do i just dont want to feel like this anymore ive been dealing with depression since i was a teenager i dont see a future for myself and i hate living in such a rotten world i could always mimic the hospital conditions by getting rid of my razor and focusing better on recovery but i just cant do it id rather be miserable than take care of myself,post-pandemic
im a french exchange student in mexico im really enjoying my experience and having a great time im able to combat my anxiety at times because being in a new environment i very often have to force myself to go out talk to strangers etc however im very stressed about the week ahead as i have to do some presentations and during the presentations its very stressful to have to go to the blackboard and speak as spanish is not my native language i have a good level but the stress makes me stammer and very very anxious whats more there are 5 of us in the class including one person who wasnt there before so it makes me feel uncomfortable ive had time to get to know my other classmates well in the first semester so if it had just been with them id have been a lot less stressed but now the fact that theres a new person which may seem absurd because its only one person is really stressing me out because they dont know me they dont know my level of spanish anyway im very uncomfortable and very very very anxious im so distressed that i cant even get to work on my homework because im just overthinking things,post-pandemic

trigger warning trauma dump and suicidal thoughts feel free to skip this post if you dont want to read this rant about my reflection on my life sorry to the reddits mods i dont know where to post this im sorry if its in the wrong sub from birth until now my life has been nothing but shit my parents like to tell me that i was born this way and i believe it i was inherited their mental issues substance abuse disorder and personality disorders thanks mom and dad my family members were my first abusers sexually mentally and emotionally then they want to preach blood is thicker than water while all my relationships with them are shallow and conditional yeah okay i believed sexlove because my moms ex bf after divorce and moms brother molested me even my own younger brother and cousin would sexually abuse me occasionally by taunting me to flaunt my big breasts when we were away from our parents when i brought up the sexual abuse my dad didnt even seem to care to try to fight for more custody because he was so damn selfish didnt want to be a real parent and only cared about finding the next squeeze to cling on to then my teenage years came along and i was just a worthless annoying whore to them i was fucking every boyfriend i had after 14 years old my mom was so distracted with her new toxic boyfriend and building her nursing career that i was yelled at a lot and walking on eggshells if i tried to approach her for attention she didnt even seem to care either when i first brought up the sexual abuse from her brother we didnt make any attempts to move out of that living situation anytime soon i think we stayed for another year i remember the conversation like it was yesterday i was called a liar and family destroyer by my narcissist grandma how awkward it was to be working at her stupid business with her and my uncle throughout high school for cheap labor and money in my pocket while i had to act completely normal like no real trauma ever happened in our shitty family then i started dabbling in drugs at 13 alcohol sharpies weed cocaine ecstacy meth molly benzos and bars along with sex these drugs were filling all my empty voids at least it numbed my bad thoughts and feelings temporarily by the end of high school i lost the love of my life and one only friend hit my bottom there and moved states away i have been to rehab twice and jail once i still feel like i havent hit my complete bottom yet the longest ive been sober was 25 years i feel like the only reasons i was able to accomplish this was by being pregnant for 9 months and taking care of my baby i actually relapsed the day after my babys 2nd birthday because i just cant handle taking care of a toddler it started getting hard to handle at 15 i tried to stay strong for as long as i could this last year has been hard too i stayed sober for about 6 months then got high a couple of times in two weeks and then got a cps case by admitting this to my therapist by the way she was such a rude helpless bitch from the start as soon as i mentioned my past with meth and present alcohol use she called cps on me because i told her i was having a few shots of tequila in the evenings when my child was asleep and the one time meth use she would look bored answer texts and talk to other people in the office during our sessions talk over me and interrupt me while i was talking i guess i would do it too but it wasnt intentional and i feel shame anytime i do this to anyone she would shift blame outwards by saying it was a telehealth video appointment and since i wasnt looking directly into her eyes and soul i have such bad social anxiety that eye contact is hard for me to do we would often cut each other off i just think she was racist not suitable to be a good therapist and lacked empathy for drug addicts altogether my husband likes to blame my relapses last year on why our relationship is failing but the truth is it was always failing i mean we both jumped right into a relationship coming out of bad cheating ones then you want to know what it took for him to finally stop accuse me of cheating me having our child a day after i gave birth and the first day we were home after the hospital he even was asking me if the child was his what the fuck after being harassed degraded and traumatized for 3 years by him thinking i was cheating when i was working or going to school it all magically goes away when i become a fat ugly low self esteem recovering junkie i had to go through hell trying to have a normal life with him and now that im completely trapped i get treated good according to everyone in my life i dont know what real love is i feel like im never going to amount to anything meaningful or worthwhile in my life maybe this next time i relapse my heart will give out and i will pass on to another life and if there is no next life oh well at least my existence can be erased from everyones lives theyre better off without me anyway fuck valentines day,post-pandemic

i just needed to get this off my mind and im surprised i havent made a post about it yet i had been sober since oct 5th 2023 i had decided to drink recently and have a bender dumb i know because i already know to play the tape i am a chronic relapser and completely understand that the crappy symptoms go away over time but the crippling anxiety over what this last bender did and i wont get into detail about it really other than i just cant stand it because it comes and goes and if my mind drifts and thinks about one of the many things i need to take care of it will literally wake me up from falling asleep and start having waves of panic i hate it im starting to be the one to give up on myself now ive been trying to get sober since 2019 i will get days weeks even months in mostly what helped me was smoking weed but i am trying to not do that anymore because i want a job that isnt freakin waitressing huge trigger to drink for a lot of reasons and honestly i had this job where they drug test and i felt uncomfortable at the idea of being high while working there so im fine with it but since august ive been weed free for the most part started taking gummies but im not high 247 like i used to be and i prefer it actually not to be high like that all the time and then up until recently id been sober from alcohol since october both of last year so it was my longest stretch of being actually stone cold sober since trying to quit in 2019 and i enjoy many many things about sobriety i also had an 8 month stretch in 2021 but i was smoking at the time weed has never been an issue that distrupted my life so i do consider it at least sober from alcohol i just hate it that i always get this itch to drink i get bored mostly but lately ive been so tired i just wake up drink for a while sleep repeat and sometimes i just feel like all i want to do is sleep anyways im trying to keep this as non depressing as possible i used to rant on and on and on about things i hate about my life and its like all it did was make it worse i try to stay positive im not sure what advice im looking for really i mostly wanted to just rant and it helps me to write and get my thoughts out and is helping me so far but if anyone had anything to tell me any of it is appreciated because even if its something im already well aware of or doesnt really apply to my situation it is good to just have people who know what its like to talk to so thats really what im looking for here thank you for reading x200b x200b,post-pandemic

hey everyone my boyfriend of a year and a half is a recovering alcoholic and opioid addict he is 31 and has been struggling since he is 21 the longest he has been sober in those 10 years is 4 years i found out he struggled with this maybe 3 months into our relationship it has been super difficult for me as he relapsed with pills no drinking and was using about 60 of our year and a half relationship so far the lying was really hard he even stole my car once and the day he did that i sat him down and was hysterical and told him i love him but we cannot live this way i love him and i see such a great person and so much potential despite addiction now he is going to meetings 12 times a day has a sponsor and seems to be doing really well the past 3 months and is now seeking a job i cant believe what a turnaround in a short period of time of course i am happy and over the moon that he is doing well but i have a hard time understanding it all can someone help me understand what goes through his mind though the lying stealing from his parents is addiction really a disease or a choice why is it so hard to stop i hope i wont be offending anyone here i am really just looking to get educated on what he is thinking and how his brain works he has a great family great life but deals with bad anxiety and depression i also see a lot of people on reddit saying addicts cheat but i havent seen any signs of that and when he does pills his sex drive is at zero we have a great relationship besides the addiction issues he is looking to settle down and i am too at some point in the next year or two but i am hesitant because i dont want him to relapse over and over and over obviously that is not healthy or me or him i really do love this person to death our relationship is nothing like ive ever had before and i feel like he is definitely the one he is super loving and sweet i am also an amazing girlfriend to him and have tried to support him the best i know how and surround him with love how can i support him what should i be doing as his girlfriend,post-pandemic
hi im a resident in psychiatry also suffering from schizophrenia spectrum disorder in my country we psychiatrist are also psychotherapist and must choose between psychoanalysis cbt and systemic therapies i struggle to make that choice at first i wanted to choose psychoanalysis since i had 2 wonderful therapist of that side that helped me a lot but i also happened to have had obsessional almost delusional about psychoanalysis supervisors saying that psychosis are the worst or that countertransferance is biaised in psychosis doesnt help theres a lot of clich and hopelessness cbt speaks to me because it is more evidence based but it feels also bland and i never had it personally it looks both magical and scientific but also superficial and enclosed but at least it drives me less crazy a bit depressed though reading all those neurocognitive disorders were supposed to have is depressing i obviously want to work in the field of psychosis specially in early intervention and i want the best for my patients and my practice my psychiatrist told me not to worry too much about that choice because i can influence in my way my practice whats your experience with those kind of therapy those who has the chance to have psychotherapy how was it what kind theres a lack of cbt practioners in my region specially that does cognitive remediation and also theres a lack of psychoanalyst that accept psychotic patient so in both case id be useful,post-pandemic
im not really sure what to put as the flair but recently i had an evaluation from an outpatient substance abuse program and i already kinda new it because i got a voicemail and i feel like they wouldnt have called me if nothing was going to happen but my mom got an email and theyre recommending that i go to an inpatient sud facility i dont really think i have a problem and im definitely not an addict and i really disagree with all of this as i do not need help and i dont trust their judgement and im afraid theyll send me to a mental health facility and again i do not need that and those places treat you like shit and ill basically be missing my life and wasting my time for 46 months for something that isnt an issue im also going to have a very hard time getting off my meds when im back im not sure what to do right now and i dont think its 100 gonna happen probably more like 9095 and thats a big chance but theres a small small chance i might not go and im hoping that i dont need to go i just started doing better at school and i dont want to be away from friends and people who i actually care about because of this bullshit,post-pandemic
i am two months into recovery now back in my ed even at my lowest i had a normal amount of hair it did become brittle dry and thin but it still at least appeared healthy i really just noticed the brittleness in my front two strands where i had curtain bangs only because i often wore my hair in ponytails didnt have any energy to do my hair ever and the rest of my hair wasnt noticeable i do remember i would lose a good amount when i would shower but it was never as much as i am experiencing now i have been eating consistently to gain back my period weight restoring stopping excessive exercise all of the things i need in recovery but my hair keeps falling out more and more its not just in the shower i find clumps of strands of my hair just on my floors on my pillowcase when i just touch or comb through my hair dry or wet ive actually become scared to shower just because of how worse it is there after i get out of the shower there is so much loose strands of my hair that fall on my back that i have my mom pull it off with a towel when i part my hair or move some of my hair to see my scalp i literally look like im balding my hairline is falling back farther and farther now i have heard many things about hair loss in recovery is it true that my hair currently reflects my health three months ago does hair growth delay from what ive done do my body is this even normal could i have something wrong with my scalp the fact that i never even lost that much hair at my lowest really is scaring me im losing more and more as im eating better and better to me it just doesnt make any sense is there anything i can do to help this anything like hair oils scalp massagers supplements vitamins the top advice that i always hear is to keep nourishing my body with all the nutrients it needs but ive already gained a lot of weight and the more i seem to nourish it the worse my hair gets any help is appreciated really thank you,post-pandemic

i have been using dopaquel since my diagnosis last year i love it it has changed my life for the better unfortunately its caused me to gain weight and have difficulty losing weight i tried a very strict diet for a while doing 75 hard but it only maintained my weight i didnt lose anything so i gave up at day 45 ive booked an appointment to discuss this because i cant do this anymore my tipping point was realising i was developing new stretch marks i am really scared though i let it go on this way thinking i could find a way to lose weight thinking that its too shallow a reason to take the risk of being stuck with meds that make me feel worse in other ways has anyone experienced this any advice or success stories would be appreciated i have bipolar 2,post-pandemic
hey guys so ive been suffering from highmiddlegrade depression for 25 years now thats why im in therapy many of this is due to trauma i experienced in the last 5 years bullying toxic relationship extreme stress betrayal from former best friends and lots of fights many of the worst scenarios in some situations eventually became true and i constantly lost friends because they would show their true faces after a while things escalated horribly few months ago and thats how my anxiety of literally everything bad that could possibly happen came to power and it went beyond that like i am constantly scared that something bad happens to my mom i have a deep healthy relationship with my mother she was always there for me like car accident diseases and many more or that something bad will happen to me or to other loved ones of mine it keeps on getting aggressive day by day the meds i take do not help and the only way i am actually able to feel good is when things work out the way they should which is not the case with the current work and mental stress level just wanted to write this i because i really needed to write that down and share it to a community which understands that hope to hear from you love u guys,post-pandemic

first of all hi my name is dan and id suffered from ocd for 18 years which turned into health anxiety 5 years ago today i will tell you my story how it began how it climaxed and most importantly how it became a tool for me to live a more authentic life when i was around 8 years old i liked playing pokmon not liked loved my little monsters were everything the quality of my days were dictated by how much progress i made in the game if i was able to catch something new there was a twist to all of this however at that time it was not uncommon for cartridges to stop working suddenly that haunted me i was obsessed with the idea of it to stop working and losing everything i discovered that after many years what i just told you was the beginning of my ocd it expressed itself in many different ways and despite it being strong or weak it never took the bright from living it was until one day i looked in the mirror and saw a weird looking mole with a blackhead in the middle after debating with myself i went ahead and popped it what if it was c word i struggled with this thought for a couple of hours then it went away a year later i had some weird results on my blood work the number the idea of having something wrong with me my head was insane chaos i was desperate for an answer which i found but it was too late there was then always something new slowly it became worse and worse it stopped being something periodical and became constant for 6 months my life was nothing but an insane obsession with 0001s i was not able to live properly i had no appetite and only thought about having a concussion or an autoimmune disease half of my day was spend on the ha subreddit venting about my fears this is when i drew the line i needed to do something i started bringing this topic into my psychoanalysis sessions and doing erp on the side since its not supported by the type of therapy i was doing it was hard h a r d in both schools of thought treatment i dislike this word is not meant to be intuitive or fun in fact many psychiatrists say that erp is the hardest therapy to do i will now share what helped what i learned with psychoanalysis my health anxiety as well as my ocd was a way of my unconscious mind to express an excessive desire of perfection as well as the belief of its existence me and my therapist called it the circle no sharp edges smooth life however is not like that it might be circular but also have some bumps and sharp turns i believed that i needed this perfect life to be happy and looked for it through these symbolical obsessions why did i have this desire my parents hardly gave me limits which created in me a neverending desire for more this was called a core fear often talked about in cbt our health anxiety is hardly ever a symptom of being afraid of truly being ill but a fear of something rooted deep down what i learned with philosophy i started studying philosophy and one philosopher in particular caught my eye friedrich nietzsche it is not possible to explain his school of thought properly here it would take more than 10 pages but one specific mindset if you could call it that helped me we as humans refuse to live life how it is we create conflicts nonsensical morals nonexisting relationships we hardly ever truly live we are afraid of accepting the melancholy of life in its purest form however by being defensive about it we also do not allow ourselves to taste its color what does he say that we should do affirm life be ready willing and happy to suffer to have the most intense illness and understand that it is the nature of life be willing to suffer and to die i started doing safe unsafe things on purpose like for ex going for a road trip jumping with a parachute or traveling to a country with no great medical care in addition avoiding perfection in everyday life also helped what i learned with erp erp or exposure response therapy is meant to expose you to your fear in order to desensitize you from it sounds easy in practice but for us anxiety sufferers it is more difficult the processes is not as straight forward as for a focused phobia for example how do we expose ourselves if we have ha 1 do not google check your lymph nodes do not avoid the doctor etc why because if you dont you expose yourself to uncertainty you might only be able to do 1 and thats ok do 1 every day eventually you will be able to do 2 then 5 then 10 it gets easier 2 do not problem solve in your head this is a type of compulsion that we do that tries again to take us away from uncerainty look for uncertainty do not accept it affirm it my view nowadays is vastly different i see life now as an experience that has no guarantees and thats the nature of it if life brings me pain illness distress thats okay because thats what life is i know it sounds pessimistic but its the complete opposite you live more authentically i now cherish the present moment i feel like i woke up and every day is meaningful in its own way weirdly enough i thank my ocd and ha if it werent them i wouldnt be sensitive to living a lie and would experience just proxies of my desire without retaliation from my mind hope you all have a wonderful day recovery is possible and we have the opportunity to learn along the way sending love you can do it,post-pandemic

as a russian conscript who has made it back home the weight of my experiences on the battlefield still bears down on me the relentless brutality of war has etched memories into my mind that refuse to fade each day is a battle against the ghosts of the past haunted by the sights sounds and smells of combat ptsd is my constant companion a shadow that lurks in the darkest corners of my mind it manifests in flashbacks that transport me back to the chaos of the battlefield in nightmares that leave me drenched in sweat and gasping for air its the hypervigilance that keeps me on edge the slightest sound triggering a flood of adrenaline and fear to those who leave cowardly comments on my reddit page know this your words hold no power over me ive faced far greater challenges than your feeble attempts to diminish my experiences while you hide behind your keyboard ive stared death in the face and lived to tell the tale but make no mistake ptsd is not a badge of honor its a relentless torment that no one should have to endure its the shattered relationships the sleepless nights the overwhelming sense of guilt and shame its the invisible wounds that cut deeper than any physical injury so before you hurl insults from the safety of your screen take a moment to consider the reality of war and its lasting impact instead of mocking those who have sacrificed so much show some semblance of humanity and compassion because while your words may not bother me they reveal far more about your character than mine silhouette in the dimly lit trench amidst the suffocating stench of mud and decay i crouched low my heart pounding in my chest like a relentless drumbeat the distant sounds of artillery fire echoed through the earth a constant reminder of the chaos that surrounded us it was a moonless night the darkness swallowing everything in its path i strained my eyes trying to make out any movement in the shadows beyond the tree line in front of me suddenly a rustling sound pierced the silence and i tensed my grip tightening on my rifle out of the darkness emerged a figure clad in camouflage his silhouette barely visible against the backdrop of the night instinct took over as i raised my weapon my finger trembling on the trigger in that moment he was not an enemy but a threat to my survival the crack of gunfire split the air followed by the sickening thud of a body hitting the ground time seemed to stand still as i stared at the lifeless figure before me his blood staining the earth beneath him it was a moment of triumph and horror a stark reminder of the gravity if my situation but as the adrenaline faded the reality of what i had done began to sink in the weight of his lifeless gaze bore into my soul accusing me of the ultimate betrayal guilt and remorse clawed at my conscience threatening to consume me from within in the days that followed the memory of that fateful night haunted my every waking moment the faces of the fallen soldier haunted my dreams their accusing whispers echoing in the depths of my mind a relentless torment that refused to release its grip ivan in the darkness of the tree line amidst the tangled branches and whispering leaves my friend ivan lay cradled in my arms his life slipping away with each shallow breath the distant rumble of artillery fire provided a haunting soundtrack to our final moments together a grim reminder of the war that raged around us ivans face was pale his eyes glassy and unfocused as he gazed up at me with a mixture of pain and resignation blood seeped from the wound in his chest staining his uniform crimson and pooling beneath him on the forest floor i tried to stem the flow with trembling hands but it was futile the damage was too great and time was running out desperation clawed at my throat as i searched for words of comfort but none came how could i offer solace in the face of such senseless tragedy ivan was not just a comrade but a friend a brotherinarms whose laughter had once filled the quiet moments between battles as i watched the light fade from ivans eyes a profound sense of loss washed over me threatening to engulf me in its depths we had shared so much hopes dreams fears but now all that remained were memories fragile and fleeting like smoke in the wind in his final moments ivan reached out a trembling hand grasping mine with surprising strength his lips parted as if struggling to form words that would never come but in that silent exchange we said more than words ever could a bond forged in the crucible of war unbreakable and eternal and so as ivan slipped away into the embrace of oblivion i held him close whispering words of farewell into the darkness his sacrifice would not be forgotten his memory etched forever in the hearts of those who knew and loved him in the end all that remained was the echo of his laughter fading into the stillness of the night the bmp the bmp rattled along the rugged terrain the sound of its engine drowned out by the constant rumble of artillery in the distance i sat inside gripping my rifle tightly my senses on high alert without warning a deafening explosion shook the vehicle throwing me off balance smoke filled the air as flames engulfed the bmp forcing me to act fast i unbuckled my harness and scrambled out of the wreckage my heart pounding in my chest as i sprinted towards the nearest trench for cover bullets whizzed past me kicking up dirt and debris i dove into the trench just in time seeking refuge from the chaos around me moments later i heard footsteps approaching adrenaline surged through me as i readied my rifle preparing for a fight an enemy soldier emerged from the smoke his weapon raised and his eyes locked on me with deadly intent we exchanged gunfire the sound of bullets whizzing past my head filling me with a sense of urgency each shot brought us closer to death but neither of us was willing to back down in the end it came down to quick reflexes and sheer determination with a final burst of adrenaline i took down the enemy soldier his lifeless body slumping to the ground as the dust settled and the echoes of battle faded away i emerged from the trench shaken but alive it was a brutal reminder of the harsh realities of war where survival often came down to splitsecond decisions and sheer luck i see how peoples are set against one another and in silence unknowingly foolishly obediently innocently slay one another erich maria remarque all quiet on the western front,post-pandemic

i have a lot of anxiety when it comes to setting boundaries for myself because im a chronic people pleaser i know that typically this is something i would need to work out in therapy but im in between therapists right now because i struggle in terms of i know what my problems are and i know that i am right to set the boundary but i dont actually feel better about anything so talk therapy doesnt help i know that im going to be in a situation soon where i will need to set a boundary with a family member but im so anxious and stressed about it and i typically forget what i want to say because the people please takes over and i just shut down so i never set the boundary plus i already know there will be a negative reaction so that makes it worse because there is no hope for a positive reaction so honestly just hearing from anyone else who struggles with this so i know im not alone or any advice on what helps you through situations like this,post-pandemic

im tired like all the time on average i probably only sleep for 4 hours a night sometimes i just do not sleep at night even if i felt exhausted earlier in the day its mostly because i almost always on fixated on something that i want to do to make progress on and if im not doing it im thinking about it i only slept for about 5 hours the night before last and less than that the night before but last night i didnt sleep at all even though i felt very tired and wanted to sleep im miserable at work right now and trying to talk myself into actually doing my job its not working though so im complaining on reddit instead i got in bed at around midnight hoping to be asleep by 1 or 130 so that i could be up at 6am by 230 though even though i was feeling very tired i just could not go to sleep because all i could think about was working on my paneltaskbar for my linux desktop so i got back up to go work on it i got bored of looking at the last one i used which i spent many hours configuring and writing scripts and applets for so on friday i decided to start using another one now all i want to do is get it configured the way i want it and write more scripts and applets for it a few years ago i couldnt sleep because i was always thinking about graphics programming then i decided to give linux a try ended up switching to linux from windows and then my fixation became configurations and writing utility programs before all of that i was always thinking about my music and getting out of bed at 2 or 3am to play my guitars and write music im not even bored with configuring customizing and writing everything i can think of for my linux install yet but i already am feeling the urge to go back to graphics programming and music i dont think im going to even get a break from the nonstop thinking so that i can get a little more sleep for a while and its not like i actually get bored of my fixations i get bored of doing specific things pertaining to the fixations like i run out of ideas for problems to solve or i find that im stagnating while not doing anything productive in particular with them and then theres a short period where i dont know what to do next like with my guitar and music ill recognize that everything im learning and writing is all pretty samey so ill just not play the guitars for a while until i think of something new to write or i come across a new bandartistgenre that gets me excited again and leads me back to being consumed by the music or with the programming ill get deep into optimizing or fleshing out something pretty specific or narrow and then when i decide im done with that one thing it just takes a while before i decide what i should be working on next i dont ever not fixate on these few things i just get stuck for a little while and during those periods my brain takes a break but then i get unstuck and i end up laying in bed for hours wishing i could sleep but i cant because all i can think about is arranging music or optimizing graphics shaders or whatever so i eventually just have to get up and go do it hoping that maybe after an hour or two of that i might actually fall asleep for a little while im just really tired its really hard to not feel the urge to keep working on something and its ruining my quality of life through sleep deprivation x200b,post-pandemic

this concept would be extremely weird to anyone without sa but im literally scripting half of a conversation to talk to someone in my college class i wrote a way to initiate the conversation generic follow ups and responses to things she could possibly say to me its feels weird to do and im definitely not going to admit to her that i have done this i know it seems odd but ive had no success just talking off the cuff sometimes you need to take drastic measures to be seen in this world of normal people im an amazing writer but suck at conversing facetoface ive found that im actually pretty good at presentations speaking at an open mic etc i think its because i already have what i plan to say prepared and practiced i hope that this will be similar its at least a starting point initiating is the hardest part for me in any social interaction so thats a barrier that ill need to surpass for this to work i have online friends but i think its time for me me to have some irl friends wish me luck,post-pandemic

im here asking for help on how to deal with health anxiety in my dreams i have always been a vivid dreamer and have always been able to remember my dreams after waking up in the past ive had dreams that involve usually myself being diagnosed or experiencing symptoms of something related to my health anxiety fixations but last night i had my first dream about a close family member finding out they have a notsogood diagnosis and it caused me a fair amount of distress im afraid my dreams will be some kind of premonition and that if i dont act on them to try and prevent the negative outcome i will have missed an opportunity to save my family member i have been ruminating on it all day has anyone else experienced this and if so how do you manage you anxiety how were you able to convince yourself that everything was actually okay if i have a dream about myself i can make sure to do everything i can to rule out my dream diagnosis but because its someone else i feel a little weird asking them to check out something to do with their health because of a dream i had any help is appreciated,post-pandemic

this is my first time posting on something like this but for some context im 18 afab and recently my favorite person ended things with me for the fifth time we had been talking from october up until a couple days ago he would end things and then start things back up again essentially leading me on and i grew a really bad attachment towards him recently i thought things were getting really serious with us and he knew that i wanted a relationship while he didnt so i asked him about it and he said he didnt love me after giving me so many signs he did and he didnt want a relationship with me yesterday i found out he called me clingy and weirdly obsessed only something merely to use for sex and i feel physically sick to my stomach this absolutely broke me and i dont know how to get over him since he is my favorite person and i dont want to continue an unhealthy cycle of getting over a favorite person by getting a new one if anyone has tips or advice on how to handle this in a healthy way that would be more than appreciated,post-pandemic

trigger warning for mentioning of blood gore beheading death and the war in israel with slight mentions of pornography rape fetishes porn addiction shootings and general shock content recently i have been seeing myself watch a couple of videos increasingly often and i feel that i might be developing an addiction to them the videos in question are cupcakes hd and smile hd which if you are out of the loop are two my little pony fan made videos where pinkie pie brutally kills her friends although i joined the fandom in middecember 2023 very shortly after watching the show for the first time im also autistic and my little pony is one of my hyperfixationsinterests i have heard about the two videos before and may have watched them once or twice in cupcakes hd she uses mechanical surgical tools to cut off rainbow dashs wings cut open her body and tear apart her organs to make cupcakes out of her flesh in smile hd pinkie pie becomes hyperactive almost like a serial killer and uses her hooves and supernatural powers to kill the rest of the mane 6 or the main protagonists of the show the videos were made over a decade ago but have been reuploaded countless times due to hasbro filing dmca takedowns on the videos for portraying the characters in ways that could potentially harm the way viewers see the characters in the actual show now ive watched these two videos around a dozen times already and while i dont watch it every day i feel that i may or may not be getting more addicted to watching cute characters get torn apart in grotesque ways so far this hasnt affected the way i viewed the characters in the actual show but given where this addiction is going it could lead to that route i also worry that my consistent viewing of these videos could potentially lead me down a dark path of not showing grief to people who have been wounded or died even my relatives it could also lead me to watch videos and consume content that are also gory in nature and consistently too given the direction im going i feel that i started to notice this problem after i watched two videos documenting the ways that the my little pony fandom traumatized its younger audience ranging from literal or implied pornography to fetishes such as inflation to other gory and generally dark content besides cupcakes hd and smile hd like shedmov and other iterations of the cupcakes creepypasta which cupcakes hd was based off of it even touches on the concept of desensitization which is the practice of repeatedly exposingconsuming content that may be uncomfortable to someone initially in order to become acquainted with it and not feel some form of discomfort it mentions how this technique can be harmful to a persons brain and develop addictions to this content such as not experiencing grief sadness or disturbedness of injury or death and becoming hypersexual or having a porn addiction i feel that the former reason for why desensitization can be harmful to a person is important to me now because of the war going on in israel my mom originated from israel and most of my family lives there ever since this war started ive had loads of anxiety because i was worried about the safety of my parents i have also had many depressive episodes because ive lost many friends and support resources due to many people being so against israel and potentially not caring for the safety of my family but that isnt the point of discussion here just know that while i do support israel as its in my blood i do not condone the genocide that they are doing to the residents of gaza i feel that watching these two videos that i have mentioned are making it harder for me to show worry and grief for the people of israel because as mentioned above repeatedly watching these two videos has made me less repulsed horrified and remorseful of people in israel getting hurt killed beheaded raped etc if any of these harmful actions are done towards my parents it would be difficult to feel sad for their loss and wishing them peace because these two videos alone have been changing the way i respond to blood gore and death and for the worse i think the worst part of my addiction to those two gory my little pony videos is the fact that right after i watched the two videos documenting the way that the my little pony fandom has ruined the mindsets of many children i proceeded to watch both cupcakes hd and smile hd again keep in mind that at the time of this being sent i am 18 years old although i did initially have my concerns of the videos potentially making my addiction worse as soon as i put on cupcakes hd my worries were thrown out the window as i submitted myself once more to content that should really have me terrified if anything then i watched smile hd same thing hell i even watched a fanmade sequelspiritual successor to cupcakes hd called rainbows hd where rainbow dash cuts off pinkie pies flanks with a knife then proceeds to slice her head off with that same knife i didnt watch that one as much as the former too but i feel that the video also contributed to my potential addiction as well hell even a few videos by the same person who made cupcakes hd and smile hd which while arent as gory and bloody still had some violence and potentially disturbing content it wasnt anything sexual still played a part in this addiction i could be developing even a few fanmade takes of cupcakes hd and smile hd such as using different characters or reanimating the original videos entirely were a factor to this youd think that there would be more of these videos i would watch but youd be wrong as thats pretty much where it ends i began to realize this potential addiction by talking to an online friend on discord about this subject i mentioned to them that i watched cupcakes hd and smile hd a dozen times without getting uncomfortable and bringing up how i heard about desensitization and how uncomfortable it is they responded by saying that i need to stop watching these videos because they would make it more challenging for me to feel sadness or remorse to people getting injured killed or dying they mentioned that they never consumed anything as violent as that outside of fps games but to my knowledge they dont play those types of games consistently to the point of them being desensitized to gore and shootings and the like i told them ill do my best to avoid those videos its going to be tough though as while not clicking the videos is supposedly fine enough it getting into my recommendations will be hard to get past and even gifs of footage of the two videos will be difficult since for some reason theyre perfectly acceptable on tenor and every time i want to send people on discord gifs of pinkie pie its inevitable ill run into gifs relating to smile hd or cupcakes hd in the end i feel that this gradually consistent viewing of two gory videos related to a kids show is putting more harm than it does any good i still enjoy the original show itself without any issue and i guess that thinking about the videos does bring out the occasional chuckle but its about time i come forward with all this and hopefully find some resources or advice to get me to stop watching the two videos or at least not watch them so consistently it will also benefit my adhd im undiagnosed but i feel that i have adhd because my mind tends to race a lot which makes it harder for me to focus on stuff like college work as well as trying to fall asleep and with these two videos being no exception its necessary that i get the support i need for overcoming this,post-pandemic
maybe if i really angle it right and fall on my head ill break my neck or smth or maybe that too is me being too stupid to even kill myself right i wish it could all stop,post-pandemic
tw sexual references selfharm and suicide mentioned for context my fp used to be my crush in high school were close friends but shes made it clear shes not into me romantically which i respect and i try my best to respect her boundaries shes also aware that shes my fp and weve been working on improving our communication so our friendship remains stable and healthy while ive gotten better at managing my feelings for her i still have an obsession that im seeking help for which shes also aware of but despite me respecting her boundaries and understanding that my infatuation with her is unealthy i am still infatuated with her i want to know everything about her i try to learn her daily routines and schedule i even tried tracking her periods after i went over to her place and saw a used pad in the trash this was a few months ago and i was disgusted at myself and have since stopped the thought of her having sex with someone else or losing her virginity causes me so much distress that ive turned to selfharm i dont know why it upsets me so much maybe its the fact that the idealized version of her ive created in my head i could never see having sex could it be i still have lingering feelings for her and thus am jealous at the idea of someone making love to her part of me thinks its because i dont trust her to be safe even though shes told me i can and that if she ever did have sex shed make sure to use condoms and birth control i dont know why i feel this way or what to do about it if she ever told me she was dating someone or having sex i might genuinely contemplate suicide,post-pandemic
dont read this if you dont want to hear about delusions hi im a teenage girl im only in my early teens and the whole year of 2023 i was isolated im autistic and the biggest struggle in that for me is social anxiety when i am not used to doing something it is so so hard for me i slipped away from social things and i wasnt familiar with it anymore and i had now developed this massive social anxiety where the most i could do was go out for 2minutes when it was dark outside and just that was hard i am happier now i have adhd meds anxiety meds and fluoxetinefluoxetin and i can do things and have started going to school again in 2023 august or september or somewhere around that i was depressed i think i dont have alot of memories from those months because i didnt do anything like i cant connect an activity to that time because i did nothing at all i dont remember the sadness that well or the depressed feelings only ever so slightly at some times but trigger warninggggggg i have proof on my arms but i cant remember what was so horrible that i did that no friends no school no social activities sorry for not getting to the point but basically somewhere around this lonely weird time i got interested in a band one of the guys in the band in the band was dead since long ago and i was very very interested in not nescessarily in a love way but it was interesting i had weird feelings about it all that i didnt know if i loved or hated i dont know where it started kind of when it ended but i thought his soul knew me i wrote him letters i was going to visit his grave when i was alone i never felt alone it was 1 person violently staring through my soul when nobody was there and some other time it felt like 5 or more i never saw more than black shadows or black fuzzes or whatrver it was and i didnt hear things etc but something was weird its gone now but sometimes it creeps back on me a little like what if it was true what if he knows me and stuff maybe it is the wrong place to ask what this was here but i dont know where else to go,post-pandemic
i grew up quite overweight and most ppl including my mom and older sister specifically constantly criticized my body during the pandemic when i was extremely overweight a thought i had often was that i was going to become skinny as revenge towards both my mom and sister for constantly commenting on how unhealthy fat big i was always wanting them to feel bad for what they put me through recently i went home for the holidays and my entire family was concerned with how much weight i had lost although i was simply at the average weight for my height and frame yet i spent the next few weeks gaining about 10lbs higher end of normal bmi for my height in order to not worry my parents even though my family still thought i looked too skinny i came back to uni and now ive lost all that weight plus more im going home next weekend and im afraid to face my family my mom just called me and halfway through our conversation started telling me i have to eat and i think its because she feels guilty for my disorder i lied saying i do eat i honestly did good enough at it until i got back to uni yet she hasnt seen what i look like im too embarrassed for her to even see i feel guilty for her guilt,post-pandemic

i started restricted eating for the first time when i was 15 but ive had body and food issues my entire life my eating disorder was at its worst and longest when i was 17 i went through phases of recovery and phases of relapse but hit one year relapse free in july of 2023 in september i relapsed it started slow but im now 20 and my eating disorder is the worst its ever been i remember early days of recovery from that first bad time and how horrendous it felt i couldnt shower with the lights on and i was so self conscious about my body when i had been so proud of my achievement before im terrified about ever doing that again ive been in a hell cycle for 5 years gaining and losing the same weight over and over again and its all so pointless but i just dont see what the point in trying to get better is i feel like i locked myself into something when i first learned restrictive eating when i was 15 and its not something ill ever not know i know how long i can go without eating before i just completely collapse and i know how many calories are in a slice of bread from like five different brands and even in recovery it calmed me when i was stressed to know my intake for the day genuinely is anyone on here actually better does it ever really go away,post-pandemic

guys for the past six months i have been trying to be functional again to no avail at least not laborwise the schizo or the adhd may be hard individually but those two together make it impossible to work basically i decided to try my luck in a laborlike situation where there were absolutely no obligations and i have been trying and trying and trying unfortunately on a good month 6 8 days are spent with some positive schiz symptom and every day is spent with adhd some dayts worse than others some days it is the voices like today they are really loud thank goodness mine arent super commanding mostly static still scary still annoying still disturbing etc and the occasional commanding voice saying something similar other days it is the visual hallucinations ill stare off into the distance and ill be unable to know what is going on around me sometimes if they call my name ill be able to snap out of it kinda but usually it has to end i mask that one by staring at my phone a lot and pretending to zone out to others it looks the same the psychosis is always there im not sure how i control or mask it like i may be doing a bad job at masking idk if this makes sense but i also feel conceited because of the nature of the psychotic thoughts but they seem so real and i just kinda ignore them more than actually have control over them i am very frustrated with life because of my conditions i dont know what to do since it is pulling me apart from people who love me because i am really tired of fighting guys and it is apparent i also would like job ideas for someone in my shoes it is literally impossible for college graduates to stay afloat i am an unemployed schizo with adhd who may miss 7 days of work and idk what to do,post-pandemic

hello all not sure if anything has been posted like this before but i was wondering if anyone here had a special skill or hyperfixation where they knew about phone tracking and finding i consistently multitimes a day loose my phone and everything else to the point where it is getting so annoying for my partner and myself i had an idea where to program a button to find phone within a house without tile or air tag the thought is to have like a stationary button that doesnt move and have a short range tracking and receiving a receiver for glasses would be good too as it is hard to find glasses without glasses the current smallest tile is still too bulky for glasses our house rule is first to get glasses helps the other which works unless one of us is out and it is a very foggy day does anyone have any systems to help this it is hard to track stuff for phone without the phone i use the reverse tile function often but sometimes it doesnt work if anyone would know how to accomplish this or have heard anything please let me know,post-pandemic

to all i am one of you i know what youre going through this past month has been tough for me i was convinced that i had at least 34 different types of cancers and just bounced around from one to the other depending on the type of symptoms i was feeling at the time the dermotologist finding a suspicious growth on my skin didnt exactly help either that is what kicked everything off this has been the worst episode of prolonged ha of my life and has led me to be prescribed an ssri which i may or may not continue taking hasnt kicked in yet today i had a regular annual physical with my doctor i went in nervous and left feeling the most relief that i have felt in the past month what changed instead of focusing on what i think may be wrong my family history of diseases screening options the types of labs i wanted i instead fessed up and told her that my biggest issue is health anxiety we ended up talking about health anxiety for 90 of my physical what i understood from our talk is that we do not give doctors enough credit they know what theyre talking about they can tell things about your health just by looking at you and asking a few questions i went through a list of things i read on google with my doctor and she debunked it all confidently she explained the reasons why certain things i read do not apply to me and why other things are complete heresay misinformation or represents a statistically irrelevant number of cases in the end i actually ran out of concerns to point out she had fielded them all and i had nothing left even trying to grasp at what if in the future were shut down by the simple reply of you are a healthy young man with nothing to fear sometimes that is just what we need to be told i know its intimidating but i urge anyone that has not visited their doctor in some time due to fear to schedule that appointment you dont need to do any tests just have a talk explain your fears and listen to logic it ended up being the exact thing i needed to hear,post-pandemic
my and my bf started out as good friends and hung out a lot in the beginning because we just loved hanging out and being with each other all the time during this time i never thought of him romantically until one day something just changed and we started developing feelings for each other ever since then ive felt really lucky to have someone that is amazing and respectful and sweet and strong but i feel like ive spent most of our relationship wondering if i actually am in love with him or if im just lonely and depressed and maybe co dependent there have been times when i feel so lucky and wonderful and full of sunshine and roses and others when i feel off or like a fraud or something because maybe i dont wanna be with him all the time i feel like i drive myself crazy from all the constant back and forth in my head and feelings like im trying to balance 2 different state of minds with no in between,post-pandemic
i made a post two days ago about over sexualizing myself online before i met my fianc because i relied on it for self worth i got advice to talk to him about it and it turns out he was feeling that i was still doing that with him he never knew how to approach that with me he told me he didnt want me to feel a dependency on sex with him with my value as a person we talked and it genuinely feels like a boulder has been taken off my shoulders the issues isnt magically gone yet but it feels manageable i guess its safe to say communication won again so if youre struggling with something similar talk about it,post-pandemic

hey guys i 21 nb have been with my partner 26 m for four months i hadnt dated in four years before meeting him and in that time discovered my bpd my partner is very compassionate and supportive with my disorder but lately my crying breakdowns have become a bit of a strain for us my main trigger is him pulling away either physically or emotionally especially during our short times together in the same place i know he is his own person with different needs it still feels like something is wrong with me whenever he doesnt want to be touched or wants to do his own thing tho ive tried affirmations on and off but they just make me worry that he is actively or will fall out of love with me its not the reality now but my brain keeps trying to make me believe it i feel so awful that i cant just believe him when he says he wont leave me has doing affirmations by yourself and not relying on validation directly from your partner helped you personally has anything else helped you,post-pandemic

ive been very recently diagnosed with bpd i knew for probably three to four months before the official diagnosis that i had bpd i had many of the symptoms and when i originally told my siblings that i may have it their reaction was more so disbelief and claiming that i was just being dramatic which i thought was odd because they have complained about my behavior and my moods very very often however now that theres an official diagnosis i thought that it would fix their perception of me that i could possibly get a little bit more sympathy if my voice is flat or if i look angry or if i sound mean or if i just dont seem to be in the mood for something instead its much the same as before they assume im upset and suddenly im no longer a person i dont get talked to properly anymore anything i say is met with instant hostility they could ask me a yes or no question and either answer would lead to me being the bad guy because i couldnt brighten the tone of my voice this can go on for days its one of the main reasons i dont tend to speak when i have mood swings speaking just makes it worse ultimately i end up isolated because i look upset or i presumably act mean and its just very frustrating to have finally gotten this diagnosis thinking that theyre finally going to believe me and yet nothing has changed some research has been done on both sides ive talked to my siblings and yet im still treated as if im just a surly horrible person when instead im trying so hard every single day to be kind and show empathy and apologize when my moods get the best of me honestly it really just saddens me im actively crying and im wondering if this is me being problematic again is this me blowing things out of proportion i think its not i think i have a valid reason for wanting to be upset it just feels like certain behaviors have been learned on how to deal with me and theyre not willing to unlearn them i dont have the confidence to approach them and tell them that it hurts me because even when it does no one cares and the behavior just continues its like it doesnt click to them that theyre a part of the problem too i guess i just wanted to vent i guess i just wanted to let somebody know that im hurt so so deeply and maybe someone cares and maybe someone can give me advice and maybe someone can tell me that its not me and that im not overreacting its not always me im not always the root of the problem in fact whenever i am the problem i stick to myself and i dont speak and i dont interact with anyone because i know it makes them upset i try to regulate my mood and to go back to being happy funny and entertaining but i just cant do that sometimes i guess i just wanted to vent it honestly feels like im only wanted when im happy,post-pandemic
hi im a pretty cheerful person i love my job and great everyone with a smile in fact i can count only a number of times when i wasnt smiling in public but im sure you all know the truth probably because you guys do it too the weight of pretending to be happy is too heavy the urge to kill myself gets stronger by the day and i know eventually i will crack im 17f and ive been to several inpatients both short and long term all of them were nightmares im just wondering am i too young to want to die have i not given life a proper chance or am i too old to want to die did i never grow out of my quote on quote teenage rebellion phase im struggling but arent we all thanks for reading and please have a great day,post-pandemic
today i had a big meltdown because my mom completely shut me down and berated me for trying to tell her about something im currently interested in all day shes been telling me to get over it and berating me even more and just saying things that make it seem like she thinks im stupid im not comfortable getting too specific its just really hard because shes always been dismissive of my interests and my feelings and shell never ever admit she did something wrong not only that but i tried talking to my sister about it but she just always jumps to defend her this is the part that i feel has been building up for a while for the last year or so ive felt extremely isolated from my mom and my sister they make fun of me and call me weird and constantly berate me anytime i ever say anything back to my sister immediately im the bad guy and our mom jumps in to defend her and say that i always go too far and how mean i am she never ever defends me from my sister even when ive explained this to her at least three times its like she just doesnt care i havent been diagnosed as autistic but i have all of the traits and almost everyone who knows me agrees that i probably have it and my sister sometimes says stuff like well thats okay its okay that youre autistic and then shell proceed to make fun of me for being autistic and get mad at me for not understanding certain things and then shell say well you know were all a little autistic so it doesnt really matter all and all i just feel like my mom and her have a much closer bond that i just cant understand because im different than them and im autistic i also am starting to feel like my mom will never understand the way that i feel or know the real me and that she simply doesnt care to,post-pandemic
howdy i was diagnosed with severe combined type adhd as an adult around 23 im now 28 since i was first diagnosed i only took er methylphenidate dose increased from 9mg to 36mg over the years as part of the troubleshooting process methylphenidate worked well for me the only downside was i was a little sluggish by mid day but my doc addressed that by adding in a small ir dose in the summer of 2023 i couldnt get my concerta scripts filled to save my life i was going weeks without meds sometimes my doc theorized the adderall shortage could mean that more people were switching to concerta so he switched me to 20mg er and 10mg ir adderall here comes the complication im bipolar i thought i was bipolar 2 the less severe type adderall induced a severe monthslong manic episode that i didnt know i could have i didnt know what was happening or even that anything was wrong with me this episode caused a lot of damage in my life while it was happening and after i also have nightmarish anger issuesoutbursts that never occurred before taking adderall ive been on the adderall for 10 months now and i have a new psych who switched me back to concerta after explaining the whole terrible story ive wanted nothing more than to go back on my original meds but now that i have them im afraid to take them because i legitimately feel traumatized by my own brain has anyone experienced something like this have you ever switched meds only to switch back to your original does anyone have any words of advice or comfort i know the bipolar aspect complicates things but at the bottom of this is anxiety about switching meds i know a decent amount of folks prefer adderall but concerta was very kind to me tldr couldnt get concerta prescription filled got switched to adderall and it induced a bipolar manic episode im now prescribed concerta again but i feel like damaged goods super nervous to take my old meds again thanks,post-pandemic

i think my liking to toothpaste started during 2022 when we were in study camp we would brush our teeth 3 times aday after waking up having breakfast and dinner since i was always around with people i was concerned that my breathe would stink so i started eating a little amount of toothpaste after lunch or when i my mouth didnt feel fresh during those times it wasnt like a serious problem but i started doing alot more and my friends would started noticing and say it is weird but still i didnt stop after while it started to bother me bcz i would brush my teeth more often and feel a sight of discomfort when i didnt consume toothpaste atleast once every while i also like brushing my teeth because i like the flavour and feeling it gives and would use alot of toothpaste everytime and after we got out of our camp i thought it would wear off but its still the same i ate toothpaste right after i woke up or after any convenience i love to brush my teeth and would atleast eat 13 teaspoon of toothpaste everyday i think it has become an addiction at this point since i cant stop at any time i want to see if other people struggle the same but ive never seen anyone talk about it like this so please help or give advice if theres anything you know about it,post-pandemic

hey so idk if this is against the rules or whatever but i have a question about a weird thing that i have theres this thing that i have had since i was maybe 89 its where theres a character from a cartoon show dont wanna give specifics and i sorta sometimes asked myself what would i do in their shoes and its helped me a lot with social issues on my early childhood but they are like stuck in my head they wont leave not in a split personality kinda way i just sorta use their thoughts sometimes its beneign or rather ive learned to live with it as a kid i had a lot of issues fitting in but that was because i was a more nerdy kid in a small town and it was then that i developed this coping mechanism and idk for clarity my family does have multiple autistic people in it but ive been told that im not autistic so im wondering if this is a common autistic trait or if its something else that may need to be looked into sorry if this isnt within the rules tldr weird character in my brain autistic thing or not,post-pandemic
i turn eighteen on thursday but i wish i was still a child but with all my current knowledge so i could advocate for myself and hopefully stop myself from experiencing some of the traumatic stuff i had to go through due to being undiagnosed i fantasise about it often it plagues my mind i know that logically there is nothing i can do for my younger self but i still feel like i need to do something even if i could just send a message to my younger self telling her itd all be okay or even if i could just send a message to my parents telling them to ignore the stigma around autism and just get me diagnosed anyway thats the actual reason they didnt get me assessed when i was younger but i dont blame them that much my uncle was autistic and had other medical issues and my mum witnessed him get horrendously bullied and mistreated so she was just worried for me,post-pandemic
hi i hope you are all good im going to share my story briefly and then jot 2 questions at the bottom you can skip to the questions if you want i have possibly developed residual schizophrenia due to a host of factors and neglecting medication for a long time for acute psychotic disorder about three years ago now so i have cognitive issues with thinking where i have an empty mind and difficulties thinking clearly without forcing it i have no positive symptoms of schizophrenia ive made great progress through healthy practices ie promoting joyous meditative states whilst listening to music positive imagerythoughts exercises like running drinking lots of water etc i can every now and then dight off these symptoms before i would fight them off and have relief from the cognitive symptoms for just 10 minutes or so now its 13 months of clearer thinking i always end up lapsing back into muddied thinking though so i have two questions in you guys experience in overcoming cognitive symptoms associated with schizophrenia how long have you managed to get your remission to last where you are near symptomfree and you can think clearly to what extent have you been able to minimise these cognitive symptoms in your case i can only see myself improving from here but id love to know how its been for yall with cognition specifically thanks,post-pandemic

i went to see a therapist who happened to have gotten a late diagnosis for autism we spoke on the phone prior for an hour where i gave her context about my life when i got to her place she had a copy of unmasking autism on the table i thought nothing of it i gave her a run through of my life my non verbal autistic older brother my little brother and his head banging when he was a kid my balance and cerebellum issues feeling like every social encounter is a performance use of alcohol to feel normal academic achievements and special interests speaking and reading from an exceptionally early age constantly singing and dancing to myself in my room being known for having catchphrases and class clownery in high school i never knew any of these were signs of autism at the time i was just being thorough she explained that i might be autistic and recommended i read unmasking i told her about my exgirlfriend of two years we keep finding out way back to each other we have an insane connection and and shes the only girl i can be myself around she has an overly expressive face eating disorder obsession with puzzles literature and film lack of female friends childlike demeanour saying socially inappropriate things and being genuinely apologetic and confused later has trouble letting go of an idea and gets stuck on ideas or feeling overwhelmed by positive and negative emotions only male friends doesnt understand female groups bullied in high school teachers pet eccentric dress code said she felt like a doll and would dress herself up for no reason etc if shes asd she doesnt mask well and people notice i used to be embarrassed by her when wed go out and semiscold her in the car afterwards for saying something weird little did i know i was triggered by her blowing our cover im halfway through reading unmasked and frequently have to take breaks to relax this is all too much im thinking back to how much i abandoned all of my special interests to pursue an obsession with social performance and fitting in and i dont even know what the real me is im a 65 black male with a rock collection who has spent the past month researching the entire history of professional wrestling amidst constantly drinking to fool people into thinking im normal my vitality has disappeared over the past 8 years since i started masking in university and having chronic fatigue since then what do you guys think am i reaching here do i tell her if so how do we stay together what do i do with my life going forward edit i appreciate that i dont have a diagnosis but speaking on a hypothetical people who recognise these traits think they could align what do i do going forward outside of getting an official diagnosis,post-pandemic
hello all my husband has adhd i do not my best friend also has adhd so ive sort of pieced together his puzzle brain and i can understand how hes jumping from one hoop to the next but whats getting to me is his inability to remember to do things i have made him lists we have a joint calendar app that he can utilize i send reminders its almost like if its not important to him it doesnt matter i know that that isnt the case at all but thats how it feels i carry about 95 of the mental load and i am exhausted trying to juggle all of this for us i want a little help and i dont think thats totally unreasonable i know not all adhd functions the same so there is no one size fits all solution but im willing to try damn near anything please give me your best suggestions that might be able to help my husband remember to do things some context he is medicated although he feels like his current meds dont help were waiting for his psychiatrist to get back to him about changing the medication i have noticed that his medication helps him but it only lasts for about 6 hours and he still pingpongs around when hes at home,post-pandemic
a little background i used to be homeless off and on for 3 years in west dallas luckily i met a girl and we are able to stay at her moms out in the country down south well anyway we use fetty and still make a trip every couple of weeks to dallas to score sometimes we end up staying for several days and sleep in our car or we will crash with various random friends at their houses so anyway several of the people who i used to live with out here all those years ago are still here when i come up i try to help them out when i can recently one by one all of the people living under a certain bridge started breaking out in these gnarly sores a couple of them use the needle but the majority of them only smoke it their plug has arguably the best fetty in dallas so almost everyone i know who uses scores from this same plug up until about 3 weeks ago that is my girl and i ended up linking up with an old plug of mine whose fetty was of decent quality he also takes our merch as payment so we havent been using the same dope as everyone else lately within a weeks period of time i went back to the bridge where one of my good friend lives just to check on him and i was shocked to see the state of his health and some of the others that live there apparently a friend of one of their other custos from the suburbs would go under the bridge to smoke with them every time he went to score when he started noticing these sores he went to the doctor and they admitted him to the hospital right away he said that the infection got into his blood stream and that he has endocarditis he said they began surgery to remove spots that were growing on his neck he said that they told him that he had been exposed to a flesh eating bacteria that passes from skin to skin contact before that we had all been thinking that the sores were from the dope like many stories we had been hearing about xylazine from the north eastern united states i went to check on my friends immediately to warn them mind you it had only been about a week since i had seen them and within a weeks period of time these had spread all over my friends body including his face i took these pictures of one of my buddies to ask the people of reddit what they think of this another friend of mine who used to be a lean mean fighting machine who fought mma won belts and taught childrens fighting classes sometimes goes on 4 or 5 day benders where he stays under the bridge and smokes fetty and ice with the homeless guys there and then he returns home to his kids and wife well i saw him today hobbling along because he couldnt walk right he had lost so much muscle and weight he showed me his back and ass cheeks along with his arms and chest he said he even had a sore on his pecker well anyway he said that he had gone to the doctor as well and the doc told him it was an infection from the cut that they are using in the dope i felt so overwhelmed i want to help but i need to consider the health of my girl and i the last straw was when he started picking at a sore on his elbow and squeezed it and banana colored pus squirted out i wouldnt let him in my car to smoke i gave him a little piece because he was in so much pain and i drove my girl and i away having a full blown anxiety attack these are my friends and i care about them but i cant risk exposing the love of my life to this i cant figure it out though none of this sits right with me because it seems that other people who go through their plug and smoke the shit are just fine no sores or spots it makes me wonder if there is something under that bridge itself that is contagious or what the fuck is happening to my friends tldr either a flesh eating bacteria is spreading among the homeless in west dallas of the cut some of the best quality fetty in the city is having a necrotizing effect on some of its users,post-pandemic

im unlovable not in the i havent had success in finding love so i must be unlovable way just when i think about it statistically and obviously theres no way to actually calculate this but it seems to be the case who could potentially love someone like me im trans nonbinary all those people who hate trans people or even just arent comfortable having a close relationship with them off the table im asexual all those people who cant have a romantic relationship without sexual elements also off the table and from what i hear that seems to be the majority of people im severely mentally ill and have been my whole life with no indication that this is a changeable aspect of me all those who arent able or willing to put up with that off the table im disabled mute all those who need spoken conversations to feel close to someone off the table im also just a boring person i have low energy and often hit my limit very quickly with activities that drain my mental energy all those who need excitement and adventure in their relationships off the table all this put together how many people in the world could potentially love someone like this i cannot imagine that answer is greater than 0 edit broke the points into separate paragraphs for readability,post-pandemic
i did the srs 2 screening test a time ago and i was looking at the results and saw that under my own impression and my score under my self perception i had social perception on the normal range but when my boyfriend answered questions about me it showed that i had lower social perception in the moderate impairment range how can it be that i hadnt noticed before i find it hard to believe since im great at analysing myself and others when i want and he said that i dont really look or act strange at glance when out with others i dont think i understand whats social perception then and it makes me worried,post-pandemic
ive only been basically underweight once it was the only time i liked my body but of course i tried to home brew recovery but really i swapped one ed for another recently ive been fasting again trying to snack less ive been hungry literally stomach rumbles so surely im eating less but ofc the scale doesnt budge so i binge and it goes up and then i want it to go down and the whole thing just starts again i cant seem to get anything to budge the way i did when i was younger im at a healthy weight higher than id like so its not all bad but even this is exhausting id hate to be in a care home and still being like this,post-pandemic

i was recently diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder and now finally it all makes sense i always felt and had legit textbook symptoms that i had it because i was diagnosed with bi polar but it just didnt seem right but personally at the time i was more bi polar than schizophrenic so i was definitely misdiagnosed even when i was diagnose with bi polar they didnt even put me on an anti psychotic i was on celexa legit arent bi polar arent really supposed to be on anti depressants because they can cause bi polar people to be manic they put me on lamictal thought until it pooped out and i did the gene site and found out it was in my red i didnt get the rash thank god though i was on celexa for a while but then i stopped it and since i couldnt get into a psych doctor soon enough i reached out to my pcp and she put me on seroquel seroquel obviously wasnt the best for me because of the metabolic side effects but i was on it for a while it was okay it helped the hallucinations but i was fine but didnt feel good id give it a 510 it did was it was supposed to do but wasnt the right med for me im currently on caplyta im surprised because its just for depressive episodes but im not sure if its working it probably just needs some more time to work i really think i i definitely think i need an adhd or anxiety med because of my debilitating anxiety but i dont get phone call anxiety so thats a plus my friend and boyfriend have really bad phone anxiety guess it helps to be the one to call for them i was diagnosed with schizoaffective and started caplyta at my last appointment she thinks i may have schizophrenia but she wants more appointments with me to make sure but on the caplyta im still have auditory hallucinations and visual hallucinations,post-pandemic

hey folks i was assessed and diagnosed about six months ago 40 year old male it made my life make sense am picking up the pieces and living with a lot of grief after a divorce 10 years married and still love her a great deal but medication has been a help in making sure i actually take care of myself in practical ways and move my life forward my doctor started me on 30 mg vyvanse which was effective but the crash could be horrible the depression and feelings of pointlessness were scary id read about other people splitting their doses and decided to try that doing a water suspension and it helped a lot the crash was still there but it was mostly physical id feel like a dummy for an hour or so after the meds wore off but not depressed but it still wasnt ideal and didnt address a lot of my symptoms my doctor decided to try me on 125 mg of mydayis its been a big improvement no more crash and i feel like a more productive focused version of my full self but the duration is a lot shorter than the 16 hours they advertise the third phase comes on only 6 hours after taking the medication and by hour 9 i dont feel medicated at all the next highest dose is 25 mg i think i need a higher dose later in the day but not double the first part of the days effects are pronounced enough i dont want more i just want to be functional through the end of the day its a great medication but i really dont understand why they dont have a dose between 125 mg and 25 mg anyone experience anything like this with mydayis if so how have your doctors addressed it,post-pandemic

i used to take 6mg invega and my psychiatrist suggested that i might switch to ziprasidone he prescribed invega 3mg for tapering and zisperidone i know that antipsychotics helps people with schizophrenia but i also know it can cause impaired speech stuttering and conginitive impairment from my experience do you have trouble communicating with other people do you sleep well do you have a job do you have trouble taking care of yourself is their problem with your concentration,post-pandemic

what type of books are you reading what genre makes you want to keep reading are there any short story books comic books poetry or series that have been interesting enough to keep your attention ive always had a hard time focusing on reading even on meds ritalin so im making it a goal to just read even if its a few pages or minutes before bed instead of scrolling,post-pandemic
i recently got diagnosed a month back and was wondering how long the whole titration process and finding the right medication takes i started out on rubifen which worked in blocking out the external distractions but didnt really quieten my inner thoughts it also lead to an increased heart rate and jitteriness moved on to ritalin which doesnt have the side effects of rubifen but also didnt fully work in reducing my inattentiveness ive now been moved onto dexamfetamine and im hoping it works because i start uni by the end of this month the reason im asking this is because from what ive seen online after taking their meds people describe it as instantly working and everything quietening down for them and clicking is the experience ive described a normal part of the titration process,post-pandemic
i have anxiety mainly stemming from my career and a constant sense of doom to the point that i am unable to enjoy benefits that come out of my pay or be able to spend money for enjoyment because it might go away any time this anxiety makes me feel the days are shorter than they normally would be like i would start worrying about office on a saturday when i have two whole days ahead of me but these two days just arent enough for me i feel i have no time in the world for anything else and even finding time to think seems a task can anyone relate,post-pandemic
ive been on vyvanse for a few months now and while i like it i sometimes think i was better off on instant release dex with vyvanse i get a high feeling when it first kicks in after about an hour i then have a mini come down after about 2 hours which is kind of unpleasant im still motivated and generally focused after this but i dont like the come down feeling it feels like being on recreational drugs sometimes with dex it would kick in very quick yet i didnt get a huge feeling of euphoria that would lead to a come down ironic because i thought vyvanse was meant to be a smoother ride i also feel more laser focused on dex i would rate my focus on dex an 8 out of 10 where on vyvanse i feel more distractible id rate it a 65 out of 10 i prefer the flexibility of dex if i want to take it only once a day i can but if i want to be focused later i can take it then too vyvanse is once a day and if it wears off and i want to be focused at night theres not much choice im in australia nsw and my psychiatrist says she cant give me dex again because it was only to try out to see if i could go on vyvanse is this an actual law i swear ive heard of other people in my state that have been prescribed both vyvanse and dex so they can use the dex as a booster for when the vyvanse runs out i only have 15mg of dex left from my prescription last september if i cant get anymore its gonna suck what differences do you notice between dex and vyvanse and if youre in australia have you been able to get dex with vyvanse or go back to dex after being prescribed vyvanse thanks,post-pandemic

i need some advice i want to move from the rural assisted living into supportive apartment in the city i am currently living in an assisted living group home it is in a rural area with no public transportation staff manages my meds and are around 247 if i need support its like living in a cocoon it is both good and bad what i like about it is i am less worried about be followed or intruded upon i tend to get very worried about being followed by cars and people on foot the rural area has made me feel safe from this with that said i have become a shut in the only time i go out is to appointments i also feel like i am wasting my life living here i used to live abroad and i miss that i can only be gone for 30 days at a time living in the assisted living and maybe that should be good enough but if i lived in the assisted apartment i could live part time abroad and i could move anywhere in the us after a year of living in this city somewhere i feel safer but what if i have a breakdown what if people start following me what if i feel like a prisoner in my own apartment going back to the group home would not be an option as there is a long waiting list so what do you think yolo or play it safe,post-pandemic
28m bp ii tldr used to have pretty good life now dont because of bipolar i just am absolutely devastated at how far ive fallen off since getting diagnosed at 20 i was a wellliked good looking athlete with no shortage of friends throughout high school college and earlymid twenties and overall on the surface i was someone people thought had everything going for him i know this makes me sound like a tool but i dated the attractive girls i broke scoring records and was a captain in my sport i had a great social life going on ski trips and golf trips with friendsgirlfriends ive had respectable jobs in finance ive tried to ignore my diagnosis for much of the past 8 years but ive suffered multiple depressive and hypomanic episodes during that time and every one leaves my life a little more desolate than before my life now feels like a tragedy ive completely fallen apart the last eight months during this deep depressive episode im unemployed now after leaving a good job in finance last summer im hemhorraging money by paying for an apartment im not living in since i moved back in with my mom three months ago because ive been unable to function ive been bedrotting for the better part of the last eight months i am struggling to keep up with my friends who are starting to get married move up in their careers and buy houses etc i dont think ive matured at all since getting diagnosed and feel emotionally and mentally stunted basically unable to function as an adult now i still feel 20 i cant even imagine getting married and having kids ive worked so hard throughout my twenties to present myself as a stable normal dude and have tried so hard to hide my illness from people and now its all coming unraveled im ashamed to see friends because im embarrassed about where im at in life and what ive become im now living with my mom i have no job and my unemployment has no end in sight i dont see friends and spend almost all of my time alone i have no girlfriend i simply dont have a life anymore bipolar has slowly ruined my life and taken away so much from me and in all likelihood things are just going to get worse as i get older more health problems appointments medications and more time spent alone i know im depressed right now but how am i supposed to maintain a positive outlook when ive inevitably already experienced the best years of my life it feels like theres nothing left in this life for me can anyone relate to feeling like they had a great life and had it stripped away by bipolar,post-pandemic

i spent the past daynight with my friend i first noticed this weird sulfurgas smell upstairs in her room but thought it was a product she was using i drove up to her moms cottage then we smelled the smell again her mom smelt it first she was in the bathroom again i thought it was a product finally on the way back home we stopped at a gas station and when she emerged from the bathroom after a while she smelt like that again and i thought i saw her take a bbq lighter into the gasstation with her and i heard what sounded like someone using a lighter she was mad when i asked her what was up and claimed that it was an odor coming from her body or some kind of anti bacterial she used shes on suboxone so i dont think she can get high off opiates but it just seems hard for me to believe that its just an odor from her body it smells like chemicals she slurs her words and like falls asleep but she always seems out of sorts so its not unusual i know she has benzos and i know she bought what she said was xanax before we left im tired of feeling dumb and wanna know if anyone can tell me what the heck shes up to,post-pandemic

had anxiety disorder all my life and get panic attack episodes on and off currently 17 years old but dont have a psychiatrist only my primary care doctor told him i should be medicated for my panic attacks and i got perscribed propanoral and was told if it doesnt work i will try some type of benzodiazepine to take as needed the propanoral honestly doesnt really do much when im in a state of panic besides physical symptoms but im scared to try benzos as i dont want to like it too much but not sure any thoughts on what i should do here,post-pandemic
i made the mistake of making a multireddit with all the medical subreddits including those where you can ask a dr about your symptoms or medical condition and get some medical input i thought the knowledge would be useful for healthdisease prevention purposes and it stands to reason it would but for me it was a big mistake scrolling through that freaked me out and im still recovering worrying that i might have 90 out of the 30 diseases i read about so i removed many subreddits from that health multireddit i made im still on some healthrelated subreddits that dont trigger me as much its a benefit to panic ratio i guess point being be very mindful of what subreddits you follow prune your subscriptions if you need to i feel like at this point it is better to live a shorter happier life than a stress and anxiety ridden longer life,post-pandemic

i met a girl who is a doctor she is in her 30s like me it seems to me that she could be a hypochondriac or frequently exhibits signs of being preoccupied with her health and body sometimes she tells me in confidence that she has such a symptom or pain and that she thinks it might be x problem other times she says that since she has a symptom she is going to consult with her medical colleagues as we are getting to know each other is it good for me to ask if she has been told she is a hypochondriac i guess its best not to use any labels is it good for me to tell her that everything will be fine or should i just listen what phrases can i use to encourage her that her health is fine,post-pandemic

hi all i have found a strategy for managing my healthy anxiety that works pretty well i call it phone a friend it is exactly what it sounds like when you have an anxious thought call a friend more specifically ask them for two things 1 to say something reassuring i have learned there is great power in a comforting word from a friend so i ask for it directly 2 to let you know what you should do to investigate the symptom further this usually looks like nothing or continue monitoring tell your doctor at next visit no rush get an appt with your doctor go to the emergency room this works well because our anxious brains want to take action and we do this by googling or overthinkingspiraling this makes the action someone elses responsibility,post-pandemic

although she did a lot of things wrong mostly relating to her own self deprecation and her own bdd that helped in my development of body issues my mom also did a lot of things right idk why im posting this i guess just to demonstrate some of the things that make me still love her despite her shortcomings in honor of valentines maybe id love to hear what your parentsguardian growing up did right and wrong as well 1 never made rules around food you want to have a piece of pie or a brownie sundae for dinner or breakfast yeah maybe not every single day but go for it 2 along the same lines never set times for when certain foods were appropriate you wanna snack on a candy cane in summer at 12 am midnight wonderful a popsicle in the freezing dead of winter whatever makes you happy 3 never made comments about her childrens bodies my other family members will say shit behind other family members backs like soandso has gotten pretty thick lately etc my mom has been such an amazing role model to not do this not that i ever would also because i was the one who suddenly gained a fuck ton of weight in like two years 4 always said that its better to be happy in life than to worry about your body the whole id rather be fat and happy idea maybe a bit unhealthy especially when the bdd pendulum would swing back the other way to yoyo dieting and nothing tastes as good as skinny feels but they were good moments to me 5 never made comments about when my clothing sizes were going up the opposite cannot be said for now when my sizes are going down but i look back with nothing but love for the way she treated me when i was having weight gain from my medications and when i was severely depressed from this 6 never put an emphasis on numbers clothes sizes weight etc honestly my father has been exponentially more critical of peoples weights on the scale when i told him what my hw was he said wow ive never even weighed that much in general i think she did a great job of helping me create a positive relationship with food growing up the place where she fell short so to speak was how to love your body no matter the shape or size just through listening to her disparage her self image it actually impacted me a lot when i got fat lol as i get closer to being thirty years old ive begun reflecting more and more on ifwhen i have kids hopefully after recovering what things i can do to ensure my tendency toward disordered food behavior doesnt bleed into their lives or impact their sense of worth i think it is helpful for me to look at things that didnt go right for my upbringing but also to look at the stuff that did,post-pandemic

i havent made friends with someone since i was thirteen years old and im currently in college i find it exceptionally difficult to connect with new people and start casual conversations that do not involve class concepts or revolve around school because i have been alone since i was in middle school i have nobody to talk to besides myself and find it implausible to start a conversation with a stranger when ive been involuntarily isolating myself from others i tried to join clubs during club rush but i started convulsing and had to escape the environment as quickly as possible i wish i was normal and capable of forming connections with other people but its virtually impossible for me does anyone else genuinely not have any friends or anyone to converse with about their day,post-pandemic

well its complicated its hard for me to even talk about it with my psychologist my voice breaks and i just cant talk even when i want to i will try to summarize all my trauma i express myself best by writing and reading maybe i can read it for my psychologist sorry if there are grammatical errors english is not my language when i was 7 years old i had a pretty normal life or that was until my sister suffered a brain hemorrhage and went to the hospital with my parents while they sent me to different families of friends and acquaintances to take care of me that wasnt really a problem i was just a little scared because everyone was reminding me that my sister would probably die although i still always felt good i was made to feel welcome by the 3 families i was with and even though my parents didnt see me to take care of my sister it didnt affect me much but everything changed when they took me to my aunt my aunt had an argument with my mother before but i still had a good relationship with my father so they didnt hesitate to leave me in their care obviously they asked in advance it wasnt obligatory my aunt on the first day just put me out on the street with the equivalent of 2 dollars and told me to get by the first day was glory i thought that not having adults was the best but the second day i had no food or money i went back to my aunts house who beat me up and left me on the street again so yes that was my situation then i remind you that i was still a 7yearold girly i taught other homeless people how to collect cardboard to get money i collected cardboard and with that i was able to earn some money and money equaled food i met a boy a little older than me in the same situation so i followed him and we became friends i called him big brother i dont even remember his real name we played when we got the food that used to be cookies once we played knocking on the doors of houses and running away to see how people react and laugh only he knocked on the wrong door and a guy came out with a gun and started shooting we ran and went together until a pam sounded and he fell silent and i just ran like a coward and left him behind i never saw him again and to this day i wonder if it was the right thing to run after all i left him alone maybe dying and this was the beginning of my traumas i was alone again on the streets they were one of the most dangerous in the city where it was known that there were criminals being a child i had to keep my guard so i didnt sleep eventually i managed to get together with a group of homeless people i think drug addicts that i was fortunate enough to meet they didnt take advantage of me in fact they were very nice to me they started playing the games i played with me the problem was that we were still on the street and had to avoid other more violent groups i remember once we came to rest at a place and a group told us to leave their territory one of our own one of the bravest said no but one of the other group also came out opened his knife and slashed him in the neck he tried to keep up but there was a lot of bleeding and he fell to the ground i remember they covered my eyes and carried me running but i also remember when i made a pet bottle and it broke we had a funeral and they did a great job following the game eventually i got used to it and one day my aunt had the audacity to pick me up but not to take care of me obviously but because i had started school and it would be very suspicious if i didnt go so he would take me from the street at a certain time to his house set a timer and i had to be ready to walk to school and then he would go back to his house leave my things and drop me off on the street again the kids started making fun of me for my bad smell and appearance in general also how i fell asleep in class it broke my heart before i was loved by those who claimed to be my friends now they just laughed at me the jokes escalated and there was quickly physical abuse after school there were times when i would limp in i wasnt happy with my aunt or at school the street was the only refuge i decided once not to go with my aunt at the allotted time so i wouldnt go to school in the afternoon my parents found me took time to look for me and scolded me for running away from my aunts house i tried to explain that she wasnt good to me but they just shut me up they thought they were excuses because i didnt want to be in school they sent me to my aunts house and left i hadnt seen them in 4 months and they only came to scold me at my aunts house it didnt go any better she had an electrical cord with which she hit me it hit my back so much that it opened it up i switched to putting my chest on but it was worse and gave me a terrible cut on my chest for a mental picture i still have a visible scar after 10 years he kept beating me for a long time until he got tired and threw me out into the street i was able to crawl and eventually stand up but everything hurt and i couldnt keep it up for long luckily i made it to my group i didnt go to school the next day because the injuries prevented me from moving and my aunt didnt want to have a child abuse warning the only ones who took care of me were them but i really dont know what hurt me more the wounds for my aunt or that feeling of betrayal from my own parents and thats how my 6 months in the worst hell went eventually i went back to my house but it wasnt the same anymore my sister came out alive and without any sequelae other than a slight lost memory and the loss of her great math skills but my parents put all their concentration on her and i became invisible to their eyes my schoolmates were still bastards i remember when i mentioned that i wanted to be a veterinarian they took a cat and cut it open by the belly and then they threw it at me agonizing saying that it will repair it i had to learn how to fight but i only ended up like this alone i only had 3 friends i dont know if i could call them that because they were only with me to defend them from the bullies thats how it happened until i was 10 then they took me to another school and i suffered a mental breakdown i had learned that i had to fight against everyone because no one was going to help me and that everyone was mostly hostile and didnt care and when i walked into that classroom i was given a different reality where they were good for the sake of being good i didnt understand it i had to fight a lot to readapt to this new world where everyone didnt call me weird but told me that i was very nice to take care of them but even so all that never went away its been 10 years sometimes i have nightmares i have a lot of intrusive thoughts panic attacks and flashbacks that keep haunting me despite everything being okay i was recently diagnosed with complex ptsd and im relieved to finally know whats wrong with me thats why im grateful that theres this kind of community its pretty good that people get together to get through this thats why i thank those who read im probably going to read this too to express everything to my psychologist,post-pandemic
my boyfriend is an alcoholic and as hard it sometimes is i still want to be beside him were both around forty and seen some shit i handle mine by smoking way too much weed so we arent really even judging each others addictions but one thing that i have a continuous problem with is that he often says that hell go visit the grocery store and come back right after and when he exits the front door he goes straight to the bar this often happens at the same minute the bars open so i doubt he doesnt know where hes going im familiar and understanding with certain lies that come from shame and low self esteem and such things revolving around addiction but this one hurts me as it leaves me hanging with feelings of being disrespected as i dont try to control him or judge him about leaving i could also be doing and planning something else instead of waiting him also because i dont understand the mental gymnastics behind this lie at all as its something hell get caught right away its not like we havent talked about this before but i feel that i need to set firm boundary with this as i have started to harbour resentment about the issue and it will kill the relationship at some point i know to stay calm and not to pick a fight while doing so but i still felt like asking other people whats the best way to do this or how manageable this kind of boundary might even be for someone with active problems with alcohol,post-pandemic
it would take forever to explain everything so im going to try and keep it as short as possible ive been communicating with angels and now i think they lied to me or somehow i did something wrong and now the outcome isnt what was promised to me the way things happened it was how they told me it would and then everything shifted i keep going in and out of some sort of place its as if someone else is running my life most of the time recently and that spirit is making terrible choices everything is ruined i was in a relationship and now i wonder if i truly was the bad one they were telling me all these secrets about him and he wouldnt ever admit to any of it i hated him for this the hate kept growing and growing i turned my children against him its as if he became my trigger but now when i am looking back im not sure what i saw in him is real i think maybe i was seeing what i was told to see vs what was there anyways i took the four kids and ran i signed a lease a few towns over i dont even have a job i was a stay at home mom but i was promised abundance if i left i just needed to follow gods plan god told me to just sit and wait so i did and then one day the opportunity popped up and money landed in my lap in the most unexpected way ever i up and left one morning i get here and all of the things he was doing are still happening even when he isnt here the cameras are still popping up my things are still disappearing and reappearing and other things i cant seem to remember at this moment and then i talk to him and hes worried about me which is strange because i remember him not loving me he was mean to me he didnt want me he was cheating and hated me he was trying to kill me or make me kill myself he was a narcissist and he was gas lighting me i was his prisoner so i thought but looking back i was not nice i was lazy and mean and didnt allow him to speak i wouldnt talk to him or anything i have no real proof of these things i thought he was doing i tried to find the cameras but i never could i tore so many things apart and the cameras would be gone i took pictures of evidence of things and those would just disappear or be different now im sitting in this house and i cant seem to understand whats happening my tarot cards were talking to me and telling me everything the angels would send me signs and songs and feathers and like idk how to explain it i feel the angels and i had a great relationship but when i moved its as if they just went away and now the tarot readings are saying i am doomed i dont know how to explain whats happening in moments like this its like oh my god what have i done but then someone takes over and just keeps destroying everything i think ive terrified my children i told them he was going to kill me i was truly convinced he was trying to kill me he was poisoning me i start talking and i cant stop im screaming at myself in my head to just shut up but she just keeps going i havent really been able to sleep much yet i dont have a lot of memories its as if my memories are all blurry and time isnt really the same as it should be days are like only hours long i dont know how to explain what is happening i dont know what is real and what isnt the cops came and checked on me i think they wanted to take me away but i sent them away i cant go away i am the only one who can watch the children but honestly i dont think they should be around me right now i remember watching my mom do these things and i remember it being scary i keep begging for help i keep begging him for help but no one is showing up he said i can come home but i feel its a trap if i go back he will be worse than before what if this is his plan what if he is making me look crazy all around like hes making me think im crazy he came here and left a charger box by my bed bed that looked like a camera because he knew id panic i remember him yelling all the time but he calls me all day and he hasnt yelled at me once hes crying and begging me to come home he says hes worried i dont understand what is happening but i know none of this is right there is so much more but i cant remember im supposed to remember and i cant what have i done and how do i fix this how do i even know whats real and what isnt who do i trust i dont know who to go to right now i dont feel very safe at times everywhere i go someone is trying to hurt me but i recently remembered the cameras watched me before i met him others have poisoned me before all of the thjnfs hes doing to me its all happened before i met him except this time its been almost two years this has been happening after my grandfather died everything changed and he says he took me back home a year ago and it was a terrible experience all around and he says ever since then i completely shut down and i havent come back from it but my episodes dont last that long thats a long time i do know when i came back i was possessed by the devil that was a crazy experience but i got better but he says i never got better i got worse so is he using my fears and making me think im crazy or is this and has this been me the entire time i asked my older children and they told me he was mean and such but they couldnt really describe how other than i cried all the time i know i need to go to the doctor i do know this right now i know this but i may not know it in a little bit does that make sense im supposed to write things down but i dont think i have i thought he was a narcissist and he hated me and when i left now he is love bombing me and trying to trap me but at the same time he sounds so he doesnt even sound like the man i was living with before hes talking to me and staying on the phone with me all night he isnt out cheating hes on the phone with me all night all day he isnt telling me im crazy hes saying hes worried about me he isnt mad hes sad im freaking out i cant explain everything i just know this isnt right i feel i may have went into another dimension i was trying to get to new earth the angels were helping me get there but this feels like hell this is not what was promised what is happening how do i know if this is delusions ok i before i post i did read this and i see how it sounds im not sure how to change it to make it sound better but something is happening here and i need this to stop i need this to stop,post-pandemic

it blows my mind that its normal for people in my age bracket to party in big groups go to bars and clubs and hookup with strangers because i cant even fathom being confident enough to be in those environments the worst part is i want to do these things so badly but i just cant like how are people able to comfortably go to these crowded strobe light bars and mosh pit concerts and pursue sex with girls theyve never even met before its driving me insane that i have a hard time just shopping for groceries while these people are living their best life life is passing me by cause i was born with this bullshit life crippling disease,post-pandemic

its pretty much the thing i recommend most for meeting new people maybe its just because i live in seattle area but seems most groups there arent very active or are very niche and groups with the most popular events dont really seem to have much of community all the big events people just go to hang out with their friends and not much intermingling going on which kind of defeats the purpose a little bit,post-pandemic
hey everyone i hope youre doing well i wanted to post and see if others have similar experiences to me so im a guy and not really a people person i havent naturally connected with a social group and dont really have a lot of people around me i have few very close friends and a partner but when it comes to people in my work or living area i seem to be slacking my question is where do i find the quiet people and fellow introverts im definitely not a full introvert because i like social interaction with friends but im very observant and people i know always have plans and consistently have people around them for various reasons i seem to spend a lot of my time alone even if i dont want to it seems much harder for me to build this kind of network i live in a busy city away from my close friends and havent really found social groups i dont think the kind of people i would naturally connect with even socialise much and i dont think theyre accessible for interaction eg other introverts quiet and shy people etc is anyone else similar,post-pandemic
i dont know why im nervous most of the time in public or during social interactions but i am maybe its just fear of embarrassment or something more only thing i know for sure is that the perception of me that others may have is usually pretty obvious it does nothing but make everything worse i pretend i dont see it to avoid feeling ashamed of myself for not being normal about it you come across as standoffish i thought you were mean at first youre really quiet you laugh a lot or oh he has something to say its gonna be good while i do make an effort to at least try to improve it would help tremendously if my own actions wasnt pointed out to me all the time trust me im already ahead of you likely disappointed with myself,post-pandemic

right after registering our marriage my husband has become completely entitled toxic and doesnt put in effort anymore in fact the night we registered our marriage he just came home to game non stop and snapped at me when i wanted to spend time together thats a pretty good summation of his personality also i realise hes a parade of red flags which im not sure why i was blind to for the whole 5 years we were together before registering our marriage probably you say i should get out of this marriage but will life get better after that im very antisocial in real life life before this relationship was just as lonely as it is now anyone wants to be friends online anonymous pen pals we can talk about anything anything to fill this void x200b,post-pandemic
musical anhedonia i use to feel the music in my bones it shook me to my core nights dancing in childhood glee and always craving more til the day you stole those notes you snatched them from my soul you burned my body and took the light that sparkle turned to coal choruses and melodies no longer made me feel i grasped out for those sweet chords but they vanished were they ever real words and noise are all that remained music no longer ingrained in my veins what was this aliment i need to know its name but you no longer make me sick a key change in life has brought anew the rhythm has returned and kicked out what was once my musical flu,post-pandemic
i 19f dont have a ton of experience with autistic people especially sexually but i love my boyfriend 20m and he does a good job when we have sex weve been together for almost 3 months now the only thing is im into a lot of stuff and trying things but he isnt i also dont think he has much experience acting as a dom because hes a switch i need some advice on how to talk to him or what might be going on in his brain as to why he doesnt want to try new things he seems sometimes into certain things but then says he doesnt really like the idea when we get into talking about more details im not sure if maybe its just too soon and we need more time together and experience sexually that he might warm up to trying things with me idk if im just getting ahead of myself i want to better understand how is autistic brain works,post-pandemic

i understand that its typical for individuals with adhd to have diverse interests and find it challenging to stick to one pursuit however im curious if anyone here has discovered their niche amidst this journey during my childhood i was drawn to writing and still dabble in it today although at times it feels more like a chore i love the idea of immersing myself in reading and potentially creating my own stories but when faced with a book or my laptop focus is a problem for several years abstract painting was my passion i found immense joy in it yet my enthusiasm led me to be overly ambitious investing significant sums in supplies for largescale pieces without seeing any return on investment ive developed in interest in films as well recently but i know how hard it is to get into that industry plus i dont want to run into another painting situation where im spending a ton of money without seeing a return basically i dont really know where to go from here creatively right now i feel like a jack of all trades and a master at none id like to stick to one thing and just be the best i can be at it i wanna hear what works for you and how you work on your passion with this disorder,post-pandemic

i have social anxiety but i usually manage to keep it a secret im good at talking and able to get out my head sometimes to converse with others and people have usually described me as bubbly extroverted and confident it is a lie i have cold sweats tremors racing thoughts of everyone in the room hating me or thinking im weird i just use the fact that i have been blessed with the gift of the gab to put on an act i ended up testing 133 verbal iq while very nervous as i usually am as a child people would try and beg my mother to get me checked for not having appropiately developed language skills she would try to tell them that i was fine but alot of people never believed her i was reading at a college level by middle school so of course this wasnt true but when i would go to talk to people i would clam up as young as five i hid behind a chair when my grandma tried to arrange a playdate and i couldnt calm down enough to say hello without shaking and blushing profusely i really pushed myself in my teen years to be braver and thought that would help i spoke publically raised my hand 5 times a day in classes chatted people up even when i thought i would literally faint wore bright colors i also wanted to but felt like i never could makeup included while it sort of worked it has also backfired immensely it sounds gross but its like peeing you hold it and hold it until you cant when it falls through and inevitably i have what i call an episode i look as though ive suddenly begun to present with shyness due to whoever is in the room i have then had rumors spread about me being attracted to multiple guys that im not attracted to making it difficult for me to not be anxious around men an example is my tremors i was made fun of for a lot of things growing up by my abusive family i lack confidence in most things such as my gait but i have learned a fake it till you make it approach to almost everything i shake when i walk in front of people to the point where my legs will stop moving i suddenly feel as though all the attention is on me and attempt to shrink further into myself that would bring more attention to me so i developed a different strategy i would always tell myself to straighten out and calm down apparently it looks like im strutting and showing off and i have been labeled a whore i even had whore screamed at me from a window in university i was slut shamed by other girls guys spread rumours about me being attracted to them or their friends now i just dont go anywhere and i dropped out of school i was in a good mood and was able to talk confidently to a random guy i had just met i like to push my limits and a girl told me that i just had to go and flirt with the implication that im some super flirty flingy type i havent even kissed anyone honestly its hard to talk about some people make me so uncomfortable i just shut down my entire range of emotional expression as some sort of shield this paired with my social awkwardness hard to operate normally when youre trying to mask every single symptom has gotten me labeled as bipolar autistic psychopathic oppositional narcissiticlow iq cold and standoffish to name a few they see my sudden lack of emotion as a mood swing or an intimidation attempt or they think that the rest of the time im faking emotion to manipulate others and that i experience reduced emotional capacity or they think that i have difficulty expressing emotion and that the rest of the time im masking or that im just slowlow iq everyone thinks theyre a psychologist now i even had older family members who i have since cut off repeatedly try to convince me that i dont have emotions like normal people do and that i dont experience empathy i spent my summers as a teenager tutoring and reading books to children at libraries i would take my sisters to the park and planned outings for my even quieter friends to accompany me i have literally cried at sad movies and i dont even like hurting flies i have moments where i literally cant hurt a fly i cant bring myself to my crying was decided to be a trained manipulation tactic by some of these people because i usually dont show emotion no joke i know that i should talk to someone i should let the people around me know to prevent miscommunications i even clam up around my therapists but at least they understand but it seems like theyre out to get me so much opening up terrifies me what if they make fun of me which some have and when i do come forward people dont believe me how did my social anxiety turn into a reputation for being a whore stuckup attentionseeking dramatic flirty psychopathic mean fake a bitchetc yes these things were actually said and why does noone ever just ask me whats going on or how i actually feel i would tell them why play all these games with me instead i feel like trash and quite honestly like a freak that just cant fit in i really need advice and support from people that understand please,post-pandemic
its a weird thing that ive done since around 12ish years old but ive had symptoms since the age of 3 so lets start off with some background background info start what started the whole thing was every adult in my life telling me that i wasnt allowed to be mentally ill and my dad told me at 9 years old that if i actually heard voices and saw things the doctors would shove insulin in my brain and kill me i tried getting help again at 12 years old and my mom reluctantly agreed she sat with me to make sure i didnt say anything stupid on the phone call with the uc davis psychosis center the lady who picked up the phone was nice but she couldnt help me after id explained my symptoms and then the length of time in which id been experiencing them she said im sorry but we only help those whove been experiencing psychosis for at least a year we cant help you id recommend choosing a specialist and that was it she hung up my mom grew enraged at me for lying and wasting everyones time but my symptoms never went away then went into foster care when i was still 12 years old on may 30 2017 and got out of it december 2 2021 when i was freshly 18 during that time though they appointed me with courtordered therapy it was horrible and invalidating i was blatantly abused by my last therapist who also pushed for not having me diagnosed with anything except ptsd i was recognized for both did as well as schizophrenia by my psychiatrist of 5 years at that point as hed been appointed to me when i first went into the foster system and he said that since my foster mother didnt believe me to be that mentally ill i should just act happy because if i acted long enough it would happen that was the best option i had at 17 he said the voices would only get worse when im stressed but theyre horrible all the time end of background info throughout those years though i found myself masking my symptoms so well around other people that when i finally got to the point it was showing no matter what i tried i crumbled before i could take one of the voices brutally screeching at me and barely flinch only an eye twitch but now 20 years old i physically cringe and lean away from the direction its coming from feel free to ask questions or share your experiencesthoughts just looking for some validation i guess i always think im faking because i was able to mask it at all,post-pandemic
my sister moved back to a different country for her university after spending 2 months of her break back at home ive been a mess since then i dont know how to cope with people i love and care deeply about moving away from me whether its physically or because of a breakup i was in a tumultuous relationship situationship a few months ago and as much as we tried for it to not it ended badly i miss him i dont necessarily miss the romantic aspect of our relationship but rather the friendship i shared with him we both supported each other when we were going through something difficult whether it was emotional or academic stress i miss ranting to him about my bsfs mistreatment towards me my best friend of 6 years and i have started losing touch because i am finally done with the mistreatment and the lack of effort put into changing she just keeps getting worse and it sucks and usually i would talk to my ex about it and he would relate it to his own past experiences and try to explain thi gs to me or just be very understanding of it all and i hate not having that support anymore although i feel a bit ungrateful saying this as i have two amazing bsfs who i can talk to and seek support they make me feel loved and everything but even they are going to leave soon they will be starting their unis and i wont have them close to me either it sucks to lose people you love but its the natural course of life i miss my sister my ex best friend my besties who are still there most of all i miss the version of myself who was unfamiliar with grief breakups are horrible whether romantic or platonic with my ex i lost not only a bf but also a good friend a double breakup i feel lonely but im not making new friends or diving into relationships either because it takes too much and i feel hollow i am exhausted idk what ive said up until now but yeah,post-pandemic

so basically my general anxiety has me worried about driving in general i dont trust my own judgment or other peoples judgment when it comes to operating a large machine but whats odd is that my social anxiety has deterred me from getting my license as well just the idea of getting in a car with a stranger to take the driving test terrifies me i know some people say that sometimes their testing person doesnt even talk to them during the test but just the fact that i have to sit in a car with this person watching my every move is enough to make me feel extremely uncomfortable and on top of that i dont really get to practice because then that means someone has to be with me to teach me my parents have assisted me and taught me some things but even just getting in the car with themmy own parentsis nervewracking because i dont take criticism well even if its just them telling me something helpful or correcting a minor mistake they know i feel uncomfortable with them too and theyve offered to help me sign up for drivers lessons but then that means i would have to get in the car with a stranger im in my mid 20s and its really put a damper on my ability to try to make friends as well because i hate being the person that has to rely on others to drive me if i go out to do things with others its all just exhausting on different levels i mostly wanted to vent but i am open to suggestions as well thanks for listening,post-pandemic

making this throwaway account to tell you all what this sub has done for me six months ago my drinking hit its peak in summer i dislocated my elbow fractured my wrist sprained my ankle but the cherry on top was pissing myself whilst sleeping on multiple friends couches whilst blackout drunk i come from a long line of alcoholics my relationship history is unsurprisingly jampacked with heavy drinkers and ive felt increasingly doomed my father left the family when i was very young and has been on the run since a warrant was put out for a dui fatality that he caused my mother has been a heavy drinker since i could remember last year i learned that with a little preparation i could come back home after drinking in a social situation and plough into more booze without anybody telling me just how much of a mess i was last night then i was drinking alone consistently two bottles of wine and a four pack when i ran out of alcohol id get a taxi to the casino in the city and drink there until 5 in the morning praying nobody i knew would recognise me in my day to day life i look like i have my shit together but i havent told even my closest friends about the family i come from nor the real extent of my drinking at no point did anyone i know pull me aside and ask if i was okay though i was careful to give no indication that this secret life of mine existed though even if they had i would not have listened to them anyway then when i was blitzed in the spur of the moment i followed this sub over the next few months this community articulated my secret life back to me for someone with zero support network and friends and family that will encourage me to drink until the day that they die this has been a godsend i havent yet had the courage to go to aa when i went to a therapist i tried to make them guess unsuccessfully what was wrong with me bringing these things up with people close to me makes me literally feel faint but if theres others like me out there reading this please dont underestimate how useful communicating on a sub like this can be to you its also only been two months which is two months more than i ever thought possible but i feel like ive started to heal and reconnect with the scared inquisitive kid i used to be at 26m ive found the first woman in my life who i sincerely love that doesnt drink i never thought id be happy going out for tea and ice cream over drinks thank you to you all for being here through this im appreciative of you all and hope i can be of help to others from now on i have the rest of my life to look forward to as a testament to this godspeed,post-pandemic

sorry if this is a bit of a rant i am hoping to get some advice maybe reassurance about having relationships ending im in a transitional period of my life background im a 28 year old widow and for the last two years ive been in a very bad place and have just quite frankly been the toxic problem with my bpd completely unmanaged im feeling like im reigning myself back in and reevaluating where i am and trying to eliminate triggers by default i feel like that has caused me to evaluate relationships friendships in my life throughout the last two years ive had a lot of friendships and relationships that ive blown up that im really struggling to let go of while i was a major problem in these relationships i also feel like these individuals were also toxic but at the same time im almost gaslighting myself into disbelieving that and it makes it harder to let go of the relationship how do you guys handle it everytime i try to remind myself that the relationship wasnt good for me or is one i dont need going forward i get paranoid im just justifying being a shitty person or that its just my bpd splitting and ending these relationships for no reason i am struggling trying to balance needing to let go of these relationships but worrying im just self isolating and ending friendships that really i shouldnt be which maybe is my fear of being alone with no friends how do yall balance these,post-pandemic

im currently a junior in college and im writing this after missing the late deadline of an assignment due 2 days ago skipping most of my classes for one class for the last 2 weeks having a takehome test due in a day and being weeks behind on the readings for most of my classes despite this i still spent the entire weekend sleeping scrolling through reddit and watching videos on my hyperfixation while worrying so much about doing my work i fainted instead of actually doing my work im diagnosed audhd so need to stick to my routine in order to get anything done slight changes to my routine will mess me up for weeks even months so much that i cant recover even with proper medication what makes it worse is that the things that led to my routine being broken were things that would normally help mentally like spending time with friends and family but whats the use in that if it just sent me into this spiral of overwhelm and falling behind that i have no idea if im actually going to get out of this entire ordeal makes me really sad and wishing i was one of those college students who could actually take weekends off to socialize and not get in a cycle of falling behind on everything,post-pandemic

basically what the title says i stopped the diets the calorie counting the obsessive behaviors everything at the beginning of this year i was so sick of letting my ed dictate everything in my life all i could think about was food and would restrictbinge this came from trying to lose the weight i gained through covid in all that time with all the restrictions dieting and calorie counting i literally didnt lose a pound i stepped on the scale for the first time since id done this and ive lost x pounds i wont share number as i know were not supposed to but it is a good amount of weight im a bit overweight so definitely a healthy weightloss my relationship with food and my body is better ofc still a very long way to go and i dont binge i dont restrict i eat what i want in moderation i eat in ways that make me feel good i think the biggest step in this journey was deleting any calorie counting app that was huge even when i really want to know the calories of something i dont let myself look it up practicing opposite action im even starting to forget calories of some foods i never thought that was possible im really happy and proud,post-pandemic

as someone who has been diagnosed with ptsd and also happens to have other types of trauma that didnt cause me to develop anything serious this is how i differentiate between the two and i say this because i noticed lots of people throw the word ptsd around but feel free to correct me if im wrong nightmares ptsd vomit inducing dreams i refuse to even tell myself or others what happened in the dream i do my best to distract myself to avoid experiencing a panick attack as a result of the nightmare normal trauma scary nightmare sure i alao wake up shaking but i can easily think back to what happened in the dream and be okay with it like its really sad that i keep reliving such terrible memories but i dont regret being alive while doing so its so different from a ptsd nightmare that when i have one i feel soo envious that this is what people mean when they say nightmare like thats a dream for me at this point lol flashbacks ptsd terrible just bad vivid memories the outline of the image in my head stays in my vision im terrified during normal trauma i dont experience them i remember the trauma often but its not vivid and terrifying it makes me cry but thats it triggers ptsd immediately weak in the knees stuttering blurry vision hot feeling spreading over my chest panick attacks body shaking hard for at least an hour aftwards shaking and weakness all over the body can last days if not handled immediately normal trauma occasional weakness in the knees stuttering and blurry vision never accompanied with vivid memories flashing in my eyes takes me a few minutes to recover rarely happens simply thinking back to it ptsd i dont thats asking for a panick attack fuck that normal trauma sad sad thing can make me cry what do you think,post-pandemic
apologies for my punctuation im not very good with it ive always been obsessed with the inner workings of my mind and finding a way to get better but when i research a disorderillness and it seems to connect dots to me i want to bring it up the issue is my family tends to take the opportunity of me doing this and use it to their advantage by saying hypochondriac or im just looking for more symptoms to add when that is far from the truth for example before i starting writing this post i was watching a video on visual show syndrome a disorder where someone will see something like tv static in their vision this caught my eye all my life ive had vision troubles far sighted astigmatism etc but i never thought about how seeing floaters or the static in my vision could be something completely different than my failing vision i would like to bring it up to my doctor the next time i see her im just fearful my familys affect on her will sway her opinion even if this isnt what im going through i want to make sure that im not overlooking it or ignoring it ive had similar trouble with my mental health as well im mainly looking for advice on how to bring these discoveries up to my doctor or psychiatrist,post-pandemic

weve been doing emdr and i had a very traumatic childhood during emdr when i found things particularly stressful or anxious id find my mind went to a health worry she believes that the compulsions are a coping mechanismdistraction from dealing with bad things i questioned this because the ha is so awful how could it be a coping mechanism and she likened it to how some people use drugs and alcohol to cope and this is also bad can anyone relate to anything im saying here if shes correct then it feels hopeful as maybe i can focus on coping mechanisms to replace this one but im sceptical as none of it makes sense to me,post-pandemic

heed warnings please i mention thoughts of suicide and self harm in this post also i think i have some pretty toxic thoughts here not actions but im worried that ill slip up and actually do something stupid hi everyone im kinda sitting here shaking with rage over a situation thats stupid and unimportant and i wanted to ask if anyone has ways they try and simmer down that isnt just talk to someone as that isnt an option now and often never is i would just like some coping mechanisms or outlets i dont get angry very often genuinely i do get upsetoffended sure but not angry so when i do reach a point where i get angry its likeall consuming my chest hurts its hard to breathe my mouth gets all dry and i just shake its awful and exhausting and i fucking hate it i have no thoughts of physically harming others maybe fantasies of telling them off but never anything violent but i do get thoughts of physically harming myself or even sometimes i get suicidal thoughts over it i have a history of self harm currently about 10 months without relapse woo and have attempted to take my life before i mention this just because when you have a history of doing things it makes those thoughts all the more scary i dont know if its a call for attention or a weird sort of punishment like a you made me so mad i hurt myself feel bad kind of thing or a youcantbemadatahurtgirl type of thing though in this situation the person im angry at isnt even angry at me just someone im close to or something else when i reach this level of rage i just want to hurt myself and want them to know it i dont usually i have maybe once twice in the past when i was a teenager like 10ish years ago but i still dont like how allconsuming the thoughts are i will also note that i do not and have not vocalized these thoughts to anyone especially the people i get angry at i just have themconsider them typing this has helped a bit so maybe thats part of the answer but still i would like to know more of what some of you guys do to deal with intense anger i dont need a productive outlet but i would like one that isnt destructive either im diagnosed bipolar 2 im supposed to be on medsin therapy but ive been without either for about 4 12 months now as i dont have insurance or the money for it,post-pandemic

i dont know why but when i think about having sex or even cuddling and kissing i feel repulsed and disgusted by it more so when it comes to sex despite having or having had a high libido the mere thought of someone touching me is repulsive and frightening i keep thinking about it more because a lot of people talk about doing that regularly and it freaks me out how anyone could even put themselves in that situation i dont understand how people do that or what they get from it because to me that would be torture and painful and really frightening i want an emotional connection to someone thats extremely deep and trusting before i could even consider them worthy to touch me and even then the idea of getting to that point induces a lot of anxiety and repulsion in me i feel broken immensely because of it i wish i could be one of those people who just does it with whoever without care and feels good from it but i feel the complete opposite nothing but dread and taking away my autonomy and personhood,post-pandemic

twsexual using a throwaway because i dont want this being linked to me in any possible way im sorry if this isnt the right subreddit to post in i know this isnt ptsd but i dont know where else to put it when i19m was around 79ish i was in lousiana to visit my grandparents and cousins at some point some of my cousins and i were brought into a room by my granduncle who ill call steve steve was a crackhead and was known for not being all the way there after steve brings us into a room he begins to have a long conversation with us i dont fully remember i do know that at some point in the conversation steve starts to talk about women masturbationill come back to this later and sexor things sexual in nature im not sure which makes me very uncomfortable i try to leave and steve blocks the door telling me to sit back down and listen i should note that none of my cousins who are all older than me by 18ish years are not bothered by this conversation and are rather entertained he then asks us how we would react if an attractive woman was in a room with usindividually and took her clothes off they answered as expected by adolescent boys but i said i would pull up my pants and leave steve calls me gay and my cousins agree and laugh my cousins keep this up for a few years calling me gay whenever the chance arrives and laughing together about it which always upset me tremendously this continued until sometime in the 7th grade when i got my first girlfriend what really bothers me is when my uncle told us about masturbation because he taught usor me at least the rest probably already knew how to masturbate he recounted his first time using a bar of soap some years down the road i recalled this and for some reason decided to try it it was a very unpleasant experience and i blocked it along with everything else from my mind i now remember it all and i am so disgusted with myself for listening to steve and doing what he did as a child and what he told us to do i hate myself so much for itamong other things and i feel sick thinking about it no one else in the room has ever seemed bothered by it nor has anyone mentioned it since am i overreacting for feeling this way is this something i should bothered by at all ive only ever told one person this and i regret doing so not because of a bad reaction but because now it wont leave my mind sorry this post is so long so thank you if you read all the way through and advice is appreciated,post-pandemic

hi so basically my sister has a cocaine addiction and also takes gabepebtin i feel this is a half truth and suspect that she is likely on opioids as well she was recently checked into a private facility for a month but left after 4 days stating that her ex partner was attempting suicide really i feel its an excuse to leave to do drugs as she lies constantly she hasnt been with this ex partner for some 6 months however they do share a child their relationship is truly toxic physical and mental abuse from both sides and i feel hes an enabler im wondering what is the likelihood that she will be allowed to return i assume they would do tests before allowing her back in assuming she tests positive whats the likelihood of her regaining entry is it a zero tolerance policy or case by case with private facilities thanks,post-pandemic

long story short about a few weeks ago i was laying down on the floor crying for help from the depths of my soul i started desperately pleading to a god or higher power trying to find a reason for my existence i asked the universe why should i keep going please give me a sign or a reason as to why i shouldnt kill myself lol this might sound stupid but the next day i find out this new kid who sits right in front of me is a really big beyonc fan like i am and coincidentally we went to the exact same show i also just find it weird because i live in a really small town around people who are unlikely to like beyonc and ive fantasized wished in my head for a very long time that i would find a beyhive like me lol this also meant a lot to me because i have severe social anxiety with no friends at school so i was excited to finally be able to get the opportunity to make a new friend were kind of cool with each other our friendship is starting off slow mostly because it takes a while for me to get comfortable around new people which i hate about myself but hes oddly patient with me unlike most people anyways every time im about to kill myself this guy texts me at that exact moment and i stop which i find weird because we dont even talk or text that much its just randomly spontaneous is this some sort of divine timing thing i dont know how to interpret this its the 4th time it has happened and its weird i dont understand why the universe would want me to stay alive when its continuing to make my life even worse it feels like some sort of evil entity wants to keep me alive to make me suffer im starting to think im being psychologically tortured by the universe or something im extremely confused if any of you guys are spiritual or religious or whatever how would you interpret this is it just a coincidence lol is he some sort of spirit guide in disguise or something,post-pandemic

ive recently been trying to get on meds but my psychiatrist is hesitant to prescribe stims too me because theres a risk of arrhythmia and i had heart surgery as an infant this may sound a bit extreme but id personally be willing to risk heart problems if the meds would ease my mental suffering also i saw a russel barkley video where he made the point that without meds the unregulated behaviour could cause heart problems in other ways such as addiction to substances staying up late etc but the problem is regardless of how i feel my psychiatrist doesnt want to risk me having a heart attack because of something he did and then having a lawsuit so i thought what if i asked him for nonstims instead are there any side effects with those i should know about or would they have any effect on my heart either ps i live in the uk,post-pandemic

looks determines nearly everything about how you feel about a person even for all of us lonely fuckers you might be chatting to someone and the chat is going great but then you both decide to exchange photos and the first person sends a photo and the other person thinks uhhhh this is not what i want at all and then they ghost immediately or the first person sends a photo and the other person likes their photo so then they send one but then the first person doesnt like the second persons photo and ghosts either scenario leaves someone feeling bad and thats life unfortunately some people here with this bullshit of i dont care what a person looks like i just want someone to talk to you are probably just really unattractive yourself and chronically online im not saying this to be rude to anyone but lets not pretend looks dont matter and we all know nearly all the guys here are only looking for girls and most of the girls here are just looking for a free therapist to trauma dump or they are looking for validation basically no one here is looking for actual friendship this sub is like water of the poisoned well most people here are toxic so keep your expectations in check,post-pandemic
im sure we all get this especially the answer seekers among us who make frequent visits to the gp im in the uk you see constant stories in the tabloids of people who are now dying because their doctor kept missing their death sentence symptoms especially those that you currently have i know that these happenings make it to the junkpress because theyre so rare but fuck me if its not exhausting trying to deal with scary symptoms when your doctors cant find anything wrong with you after tests physical exams scans etc and after years of symptoms my brain keeps telling me that they missed something at the start and by the time they discovered it ill be too far gone to treat i apologise if ive screwed up triggered anyone or posted in the wrong place im new here and to be honest the anxiety is affecting my ability to think logically edit i apologise for not replying to individual comments im still unsure if what i can say here without being banned which is understandable because i know how triggering these discussions can be i fully understand the physical affects you guys gave described though i was diagnosed with panic disorder secondary to illness anxiety disorder and was subsequently put on beta blockers i wonder if that has helped any of you ive actually found yoga quite helpful which i didnt think would be of any use due to being a sort of scientificrationallyminded sort of person but i do find it really calming when i realise theres nothing i can do until i can see a doctor i think its the feeling of your body working in a way thats aimed at mental wellbeing rather than working out to be physically healthy that sort of grounds me a little whether or not meds or excerise works for you and neither work to really combat this constant limbo resolutely but i hope you all find something that does id like to say thank you for replying and its comforting to know im not alone respect to you all people underestimate how hard it is to function while dealing with this,post-pandemic
cw for medical trauma my first bout of health anxiety occurred after a traumatic event it wasnt medical necessarily but thats just where my brain ran with i guess after some time i grew out of it then when my daughter was younger she suffered an undiagnosed acute medical incident she made a full recovery i myself also began to have some chronic issues by this point albeit fairly common ones which ive all but completely gotten a handle on now after years of meds and lifestyle stuff i still struggle with health anxiety that i know is very illogical i have personally never met anyone with health anxiety who doesnt have at least some medical trauma i have also personally seen people who previously had zero health anxiety develop it following a medically traumatic event im wondering what yall think would it make more sense to refer to a lot of health anxiety as medical trauma theres such a stigma surrounding health anxietyie just hypochondriabut perhaps identifying trauma as the root cause of this neurosis will alleviate that what are your thoughts,post-pandemic
just found this subreddit and tought i had to share how my health anxiety is almost completely gone and its been gone for a couple of years now my way of overcoming it isnt by any means a way i would recommend to anyone since it was extremely time consuming and ate thousands of hours of my life hours wich i couldve done something better with even tough it almost cured my health anxiety so just like every hypochondriac i tought i had new diseases all the time i cant even count how many diseases ive tought i had and as most others i always googled the symptoms and some horrible disease came up but my anxiety became worse and worse through the years and after a while basicly all i did for a period of 2 years was to read about diseases i was completely obsessed reading in my freetime and at work every opportunitie i got i started to read on all the normal websites in my first language english is my second language at first read everything i could get my hands on then i started reading these websites that had alot of words that only doctors and such would understand so i started googling all these words and phrases so i could understand what was being said on these websites and after a while once i didnt think my first language websites had all the information i wanted on whatever disease i had that week i started to read everything in english too i got so extremely knowledgeable on a ton of diseases that i started to understand every small detail and intricacies of alot of diseases then i started to understand that the first website that comes up when you google some symptom is just a short summary of an disease and yes you might have the same symptoms but if you get get very familiar with a disease you start to see that the symptoms you have are not at all the same as most people with this specific disease are experiencing at for example an early stage of a disease im not sure if im explaining it really well but i hope you get the gist of it but i think what eventually cured me from health anxiety was the same thing as exposure therapy even tough i did it unknowingly becouse i did spend thousands upon thousands of hours reading and looking at pictures about diseases in 2 different languages i do suffer from other forms of anxiety still but i would say that my health anxiety is atleast 8590 gone i feared so much for so long and i exposed myself so much that it no longer scares me if i get some symptom now i basicly think its nothing or im brave enough to accept whatever disease that might come and just move on with my day but like i said earlier i would not recommend my way of overcoming this to anyone there are probably tons of better advice and less time consuming out there but i wanted to share my story becouse it might help someone in some way,post-pandemic

hi everyone i have a question regarding ed recovery as an autistic person i had an eating disorder in high school but it was never about losing weight i just wanted to eat the same things at the same times every day my disorder was mostly caused by my ocd and my autisms need for control and sameness i ended up underweight because i wasnt eating enough and my ocd made me worried about health i was obsessed with sameness my strict routine made me happy i tried intuitive eating as part of my recovery and ended up overeating because i have trouble telling if im hungry or full i gained a lot of weight then lost down to a normal weight by paying attention to calories unfortunately counting calories triggers my ocd so i try not to however i am having trouble doing intuitive eating because i cant really tell when im hungry or full i end up eating almost nothing and then overeating the net balance has me maintaining my weight but in a pretty miserable manner i have trouble telling if im hungry unless im ravenous or if im lightheaded cant focus etc i have trouble telling if im full unless im overlyfull but then im uncomfortable im hyposensitive in some of my other senses could this be the same thing has anyone else delt with this or does anyone have any advice,post-pandemic
this is my first post ive no idea on how to use tags and i feel like i currently dont have the energy to look up for the correct one but im looking for some support and advice even tho i might also be venting im sorry if i put the wrong tag or didnt perfectly follow the guidelines as per the title i did it again i went through 4 days of discussing with my now exgirlfriend on totally random topics on a full scale infinite loop i couldnt stop day 1 on day one we discussed about how i react to things i tried explaining to her why did this happen what i felt i was how i felt a monster how i screamed because of specific things she did when i was at it refusing her for fear of her leaving and i told her even if i actually have bpd that i didnt mean to use it as an excuse but i wanted to get to the bottom of it with professionals and i wanted to change for her not to be like that i told her that i was looking for a solution that i know that she didnt want to leave me or cheat on me or that i knew she didnt hate me but she decided to adopt a weird method of reacting to that day 2 after day one everytime i did something she went on saying she was sorry for something she hadnt done i dont know if i hurt her this much or if shes a pwbpd too im no professional and im not so good at understanding it knowing there are more quite forms of it and this hurt me more because its not her fault when i have these moments its my fault no matter what so her behaviour and her distancing and her reactions to how i behaved such as not talking not sharing stuff starting to say things that were not going good but stopping before saying anything staring at me like she wanted me dead for minutes at a time and not telling me her behaviour kept triggering me and i couldnt stop even tho i had told her i would have tried seeking help to avoid screaming at her face as i did on day one how she kept behaving towards me made me do the same mistake on the very next day i dont know what she wants but i for sure know that even if i really want to change to actually enjoy the love i have for her she needs to give it the time that is needed i cant stop getting triggered at stuff just because i said i want to even if i told her i dont feel the things i express during those moments i cant pretend i wont do it again after just a 24 hours span she kept acting like this not talking not saying shit to me looking at me dead in the eyes telling me i scared her and that now she feared me because she has traumas like if every other person on the planet had no traumas and she was the only one so i kind of activated an automatic mode i started dissociating in the worst way it ever happened to me i kind of felt disconnected and could only go on excusing anything i was doing even breathing if i felt i was doing it in such a way that hurt her and she kept going on with her rant on how i dont love her enough how i do this on purpose because i like hurting people how i react this way because i never loved her enough and i dont even know which of these things are real anymore so i sit on an high wall looking down and she felt like i wanted to end myself and she took me and put me on the ground but after that she made it look like it was solved even if i perfectly knew it wasnt days 34 we went to a free party togheter on days 3 to 4 and it was good for the first 7 hours then as soon as i stopped doing what apparently was to make me have the perfect happiest day meaning i followed and made everything she liked like dancing for hours to an end even if i didnt want to or bingeusing drugs as soon as she wanted to even if i just felt to sit for hours with random people around the fire and just sit there not talking apparently she was doing it all for me and at that time she had drunk so much that she just couldnt understand shit anymore so when i told her that it was ok if she wanted to dance even if i didnt want to it all started again so i kept distancing myself more and more for the rest of the day until we went from that to discussing again her biggest fear being seen as a person that doesnt have a perfect like in front of the others not losing me at this point and she was so drunk and she kept using drugs and i asked her to stop to go to sleep she could barely walk and i didnt want her to fall and hit her head this me touching her safe habits is what made the discussions start on the second month out of six of our relationship i tried to tell her that if she wanted me to be changed i was on it to complete the quest and if it was better for her i was ok with waiting a few weeks or months before seeing her again since i didnt want to hurt her anymore the rest of the discussion i cant really remember i know she tried to make me shut up trying to rpe me as a previous girlfriend did i know it was alcohol and drugs doing it but i didnt want to she just sat on me and tried to make me stop talking through sex but i didnt want to so i kept spiraling down and i now couldnt find anything positive to grasp on and try to stop my brain doing that shit i could only see the mistakes i made with her and in previous relationships so i kept spiraling down and dissociating at a certain point i just quit talking to her so on day 4 after being driven to my car by her friends that i need to be ok with but lets never try hanging out with my friends because she doesnt like them i actually seem to hang out with them to cheat on her and they are dumb whilst her drug addict friends are ok i try accompanying her to the bus station and tell her to go away and putting an end to our relationship but she didnt talk and didnt want to get out of my car she kept not allowing me to get out of it or turn it on and drive somewhere so i screamed and she didnt want to get out or talk she repeatedly told me she wanted to talk but she still was drunk af and she didnt understand herself or something so i told her that i would have told her three more times otherwise i was obliged to let her get out of the car by any means she was trapping me and i felt like i was not going to scream at her this time i felt i could get to use my hands so i got out of the car window giving on a 34 metres fall took her stuff out of the car and asked her to get out she did but she sat inside the back of the car impeding me to leave so i grabbed her and spinned her and she fell on the ground and now i feel like i pushed her and punching her wouldnt have been better and i screamed at her to leave and she told me no i want to talk i gave her the opportunity to actually talk three times before definitely leaving her i wanted to talk and try and solve the unsolvable but she was so drunk every time i tried to get there and talk she just kept looking at me dead in the eyes i could see that if she had a knife she would have not thought twice about killing me i know it is all my fault and i want to die and im kind of frozen here at home and today i work in the evening but i feel like i just need to stay home and never ever hang out again i would like to write her and try to repair what i did but she didnt write to me since then so she doesnt want to i fear i could self hurt but i deserve it this time i caused her to do self harm she cut herself because of me and she drunk that way because of how i treated her she told me she cut herself not because of me but her parents but i dont believe her anymore i know i hurt her and she found any possible mean to avoid telling me it was me hurting her but instead giving the fault to herself her parents etc help i want this to end i know i saved her by dumping her and that shell realize it soon but i dont want to leave her i love her and she is my life and i dumped her and shell never come back and i dont know what else to write to her but i did something wrong and she doesnt want to hear this and im trapped here i just want to end this i cant do this to everyone close enough i want to die im done,post-pandemic

i wanted to post a story of hope for those of you still out there battling addiction every day tomorrow is valentines day and will mark my 12 years sober date from heroin and opiates on valentines day 2012 i woke up in a hospital from an overdose of heroin i was at the absolute lowest point in my life with little care if i lived to see another day or not jail at one point didnt sound too bad compared to the life i was living after i was revived i woke up to my parents standing over me and the look of horror and disappointment is something i will never forget i was given two options either go to detox and then residential care or they were done trying to help and wanted nothing to do with me my dad didnt want to help at all and had already completely written me off i decided to go to detox at a psychiatric hospital that had a very well known residential facility next door withdrawals were horrible the first three days i wanted to die then i was put on suboxone which is a whole other story on how i got clean i stayed in residential treatment for 45 days and promised myself i would do everything that they told me to do i went to 90 meetings in 90 days probably more just to keep myself busy after residential i lived in a halfway house next to the facility weirdly enough 10 years later from that point the guy who ran that halfway house would be apart of my life again after i started rehab and for about two years later from that point too i felt alienated from my family but i keep trying telling myself actions speak louder than words and they will either come around or they wont its out of my control i admitted i needed help and listened to people with long term sobriety on what to do every month making the decision to stay sober got a little easier even when things would get rough just deciding to stay sober during those hard times made it easier later on to impulsively stay sober i dropped all my using friends deleted all of my social media and started making new healthy friendships skip ahead 9 years later i go back to college i get my degree in human services on the substance abuse track a year after that i apply for my sacit substance abuse counselor in training credentials a few months after that i get approved during that process i was brought onto a treatment center as a substance abuse counselor we do outpatient intensive outpatient residential and pretty much everything else a treatment center offers i found out a couple weeks after getting the job that the guy who runs the agency i am at is the same guy who ran the halfway house at the rehab i originally got sober at he only had 3 year sober when i met him i have remained sober ever since and am still employed at the residential facility as a sac running groups with a caseload of 8 clients i see individually for an hour each per week i have been given a second opportunity to help people who i deeply understand and couldnt be more grateful now my dad is the one who calls me when he needs advice on his own anxiety my mom calls all the time for advice as well ive never been closer to my family than i am today something i thought 12 years ago would never be possible again i have learned to forgive myself for what i have done in the past i would like to tell you theres an easy way through recovery but there is not and i fully understand how much harder fentanyl is to get off than heroin my point of this post is to give the addict still suffering hope if you want it bad enough you can achieve absolutely anything you put your mind to im currently enrolled in school for my bachelors i have one more year before i have my bachelors in clinical psychology and two and a half more years before i have my masters in social work valentines day february 2012 was the day i thought my life was over but little did i know it was the day my life started back up if anyone needs someone to talk and read my storyrant feel free to message me i can give you resources and point you in the right direction 12step meetings werent for me i see their benefit but i did things differently recovery isnt a one size fits all type deal but taking the first step is mandatory to taking back control of your life thank you for making it this far you got this keep pushing,post-pandemic

in general do you ask them to change topic do you explain you have bad experience with it i ask bc this friend explained his relationship with alcohol to me in detail eg how he cant drink 2 distinct drinks anymore because hes been too drunk on them i immediately thought about the drinks i had the night that caused my ptsd and had their taste in my mouth how do you mention this hes a goodkind friend itd be okay if i told him but a bit oversharing i dont really need every one of my friends to know but also i felt like i had to hide how hard i tried to fight back the trigger and relax as he was talking,post-pandemic
dont mind me im just yapping here slight tw just talking about my experiences skip if you dont wanna read about it and just want to read my main point ive had an ed for forever and i was my absolute lowest back in 2022 obviously did damage to my body as my heart still feels weird to this day then when i went into recovery extreme hunger was kicking my assss i thought i wasnt sick enough at the time but now that i look back at my lowest and even lower i wonder why i dont feel as sick as i did then its triggering and makes me want to get worse and worse i mean i even have my period now and i weigh less than i did when i was at my sickest at the same time however i have a boyfriend a lovely amazing boyfriend who ive been with for over a year now i was struggling with my ed at the beginning of our relationship and well into it as well but now i find it so hard to keep going i find it so hard to do absolutely anything somewhat harmful to myself it makes me feel so invalid bc other ppl with eds are also in relationships and yet still restrict so why is it so hard for me to do it my ed wants me to get sicker but my heart is telling me to take care of myself instead i feel this sort of guilt if i even consider restricting myself idk i know there must be some psychological explanation to this but im just so frustrated with myself that its so hard for me to keep going with my ed and my heart asking for me to recover and take care of myself is winning over my ed how come this isnt the same for others i wonder if im faking it all,post-pandemic

hey all heres my issue recently ive been struggling with my bpd symptoms but i dont know how to reach out to my friends for help without being too much they all know im bpd but i stopped talking about my problems with them for the most part about two years ago the friend group im referring to has been with me since i was 11 i started developing severe mental health difficulties when i was 12 leading to developing sh issues and suicidal tendencies the thing is when i was in y8 and was reported for my sh i confessed to it all immediately like the same day i was a cringe 12yearold with no idea of boundaries or what was crossing the line and it went as far as me just rolling up my sleeves and showing them etc i realised soon ater that this was both gross and horrible to have done but over the years there were similar incidents such as them having to help me with first aid on multiple occassions calling ambulances and that sort of thing i wasnt the best friend and overexposed them all to wayyy too much then about 3 years ago our friend group welcomed some new members and dropped some one of these ppl also had bpd thats what i think anyway im like 99 certain anyway i became this persons fp literally overnight we spent all our time talking and hanging out and were super close we evnted to each other a lot talked about opur equally probkematic mothers and our problems i didnt really notice at the time that they were becoming quite controling and didnt let me talk about my problems to them because that was their boundary but i had to listen to theirs etc then there was an incident one of the things i regret the most in my life to this day i got drunk like really really drunk and i dont even remember it happening but according to witnesses i smashed a bottle by accident and got really upset at myself and grabbed some glass and yk there was incredibly minor damage i only found out it had happened when i saw the small marks and asked someone what had happened apparently someone had taken it off me before any real damage had been done and things were fine after however this person who i was close with went ballistic after i was accused of being abusive of being a gaslighting manipulator and they told everyone i knew that i was a horrible hateful person who was determined to drag all of my friends dwn with me until we eventually all committed they blocked me and that was that we had altercations a few times afterwards for example the time i found them drunk and passed out in a park and carried them home where they proceeded to stop me in their driveway and tell me i was the worst person theyd ever met and that they hoped my friends realised that eventually anyway cut to now and basically since then i stopped talking about my mental health in its entirety with this group bar when i got a bit too drunk and told them the basics it wasnt intentional at first but in y11 i was sent to a pru unit school for special kids and wasnt able to see them so it was kind of forced silence but when we were able to hang out i began to feel really cringe and bad when i started talking abt it so i just stopped then i found out that the person i was talking about earlier had started being friends with some of them again and i felt so hurt but i didnt feel like i could say anything cause in my head they were totally right and i was a horrible friend who was manipulative and controlling yk at the moment the only person who knows the extent of my health is my best friend but i feel terrible for being so open with her bcs shes a very private person and it feels much too one sided for me to be sharing what i am with her yk anyway recently its been getting real real bad i finished dbt last august with flying colours but when i was sent back to camhs they messed with my meds and ive been rocky since i turned 18 in january which was a huge trigger and its been truly terrible since i really need help and now that im 18 ive been discharged so until i can find a private therapist wholl take my health insurance im on my own i know i should start by just telling them whats going on but all i can think about is that person and how im the worst friend and how none of these people should be friends with me at all for what ive put them through how the fuck do i tell them im not ok when they probs cant do anything anyway and i feel like a complete and utter burden i dont want them to realise i suck because i had to drop out of school last year im also on my own at a college i do have one friend from this group there but we are on alternating timetables so i dont get to see her often and shes having a bad patch herself at the moment so i cant really talk to her how do i do this how do i aks for their help when i dont even know how they could really help and when i feel like absolute shite for doing it,post-pandemic
i got diagnosed in october with anxietyadhd and was able to start meds soon after i asked to treat adhd first because ive overcome a very large amount of my anxiety on my own the past 6 years i had concerta first and then switched to vyvanse which was literally amazing i was so excited i found something that worked so quickly after my diagnosis but then after like 2 weeks it had no effect on me at all i dont know what to say to my doctor because i feel weird about asking for new stimulants or a higher dose of vyvanse she put me on antidepressant for my anxiety in place of adhd meds and i had to stop them right away cuz they made my heart too fast i dont want to seem like im asking for meds just cuz i want to try them does that even make sense i dont even know what im supposed to feel like on them so how can i even ask it just feels super weird but thats probably the residual anxiety i havent quite conquered yet lol anyways has anyone ever had that happen to them with a new medication that they were doing good on so disappointing,post-pandemic

ive been suicidal since i was 14 and at this point ive taken control of my life in a lot of ways im not in education not in work i deliberately sabotaged all of the relationships i had with family and friends to the point they barely exist to me slowly learned how to deal with my anxiety and my alcoholic mother has sobered herself up over the last year my trauma no longer binds me everything ive done over the last year suicidal tendencies selfdestruction desperation for control its made me a clean slate i finally feel free i also feel bored my life no longer has an enemy or a major conflict to live in spite of my mental condition isnt new to me anymore and im no longer too young to understand myself the very nature of freedom has made me suicidal for completely different reasons so where do i go from here im not interested in slaving myself away for a corporation that doesnt care in a career that doesnt fulfill me the options i have are boring to me theres nothing interesting to me in existing within the confines of a system built against me there was something to say about being a neglected child emotionally abused sexual trauma if i had died the last date i set it wouldve at least meant something or the date before then or the date before then but choosing to live really just feels like passing the time and it doesnt fulfill me id honestly prefer some greater pain the only thing ill miss out on is love i guess in high school i was too busy juggling my home life and my mental health to do anything with anyone but its just not enough of a regret to make me search for relatability where there isnt like i used to do with friends my 18th birthday is in march and the last thing i want in the world is to let that happen train just an hour away and no one to keep me from leaving the house ez very likely ill delete this after some time this subreddit has been a part of my life for years though so it feels worthwhile to put myself out there one last time if anything its sentimental,post-pandemic

i stumbled across this movie on netflix and bro ive never seen a movie that accurately captured my anxiety without over exaggerating everything its an animated movie btw there was a scene where he was trying to avoid getting called on to answer a question in class he knows the teacher calls on people who dont raise their hand but then raising his hand would be too risky so he tries to make himself invisible but not too invisible so its not suspicious like i swear ive had those same exact thoughts multiple times when i was in school it perfectly captured how we overthink everything and think the outcome is always going to be negative if anyone knows any other movies like this please let me know i like watching them so i have something to relate to,post-pandemic
ive been having a rough string of luck finding a therapist that deals with hypochondria out of the practitioners ive met 1 first one asked me about my health and said the life expectancy in canada is around 80 so i have no reason to worry about dying asked me to subscribe to meditation podcasts 2 second one went straight to asking me to download their app for meditation podcasts and listening to them during the session the app collects every type of data from my phone 3 i paid 260h for one cbt specialist but i was their first patient coming to them specifically for hypochondria the exercises revolved around recognizing triggers for hypochondria and avoiding checking behavior but after 10 sessions i couldnt feel i was making good progress could have been my fault im not blaming them but they did tell me they have no other patients with my strain of anxiety tldr does anyone know any practitioners at any cost that have experience dealing with patients with hypochondria,post-pandemic
first off id like to say thanks to this community ive only posted a couple times but i read the forum a lot on february 9th after 12 years of drinking with no pauses i woke up and decided to stop im in my sober infancy but i have some surprising things i wasnt sure would happen in just the first 9 days i have seen lots of improvements my eyes feel much better i didnt even know they were bad until they were better i have more energy i have a few other expected things like better sleep focus outlook etc heres a strange and very welcome surprise over the last 3 years ive noticed that speaking clearly even when sober during daytime was somewhat difficult i even went to the doctor last year to ask what was happening its like my speech skills were diminishing ive had about a 50 rebound in just the last week people are even saying why do you sound clearer that was a weird one i never even connected that issue to drinking anyways thanks for the support and lets keep this going,post-pandemic

ive been mentally exhausted for years which is creating physical exhaustion im scared im showing signs of having a breakdown i dont know what to do or who to talk to about this background diagnosed with ptsd in 2019 at age 30 after a childhood with emotional abuse undiagnosed adhd sexual trauma and back to back emotionally and physically abusive romantic relationships in my 20s my ptsd diagnosis was the first time i started to feel i was on the road to a calmer life with emdr consistent therapy and mindfulness practices then a few months later in 2020 i found myself dealing with the same calamity everyone else did and in that isolating and confusing space ended up in yet another abusive relationship this one somehow worse than the others in 2022 i was finally able to leave move and had to readjust to a new city career the grief over both the relationship and other losses was intense i also went through medical procedures throughout last year that took a lot of my time and energy and have left me feeling further depleted throughout all of this on the surface i have generally managed to maintain financial stability and some level of career success i have good friends a therapist and loving family i am in decent physical shape on the inside however i am constantly overwhelmed basic tasks take a ton out of me i am incredibly disorganized and lose track of parking tickets auto registration and other basic adult responsibilities the more i succeed at work the more my personal care completely slides out the window i havent worked out consistently in years dating has been difficult its as if i only have the energy to pay attention to one facet of my life as an adult i am physically exhausted and have repeatedly had colds and viruses i swear my face has aged dramatically the last two years all of this feels unsustainable i fantasize about taking some sort of work leave and going into an in patient treatment facility or quitting my job moving again and working part time at some sort of low responsibility gig until i feel more rested my financial situation would prob not allow for the latter i guess i am venting but also looking for advice on whether this sounds like i am setting myself up for a breakdown whether i should genuinely explore an inpatient option or if theres other treatments to explore neurofeedback therapy cereset stellate ganglion block are all on my radar,post-pandemic
yeah ive been through the whole shpiel ive found im just too lazy to live in this world as a 23 year old there is literally no hope of owning my own home im a kissless virgin whos never had a girlfriend i wish i could just build up the courage to walk into traffic or wait on a set of train tracks but something seems to prevent me from leaving the house whenever im alone and have an opportunity im disgusted with my own brains lack of effort and i refuse to accept handouts from anyone i owe my parents nearly 4000 cad and am jobless and dropped out of university i wish i could just leave this world behind but it would seem im too much of a pussy to even go through with that,post-pandemic

im so sick of how fast the cans pile up cant put them in the trash because my roommates will see them all so i walk them to the dumpster a quarter mile away and i only want to do that once or twice a weekthere are always unfinished cans from when i fell asleep that i need to first pour out and it is a pain after only a night of drinking my bedstand is full of ugly empty cans then when it hits two or three nightswow its like having a constant insect infestation the empty cans are like cockroaches it is a constant eyesore and nuisance i hate hearing the cans jingle when i open the bedroom door and i obviously particularly hate it when one that still has a small amount of liquid falls or gets tipped over somehow i love it when i take them out and it is suddenly clean but then feel so discouraged when later that night i have 15 empty cans of beer by my bed after a single day of drinking cant drink liquor because i have had multiple attacks of acute pancreatitis and liquor was generally the culprit liquor always causes me issues and i avoid it,post-pandemic

i feel like these situations are where my bpd really shines lol im crazy obsessive ill get a look from a guy and im already planning our hypothetical future together ill talk to someone for 3 consistent days and my mood starts to revolve solely around our interactions if its longer than a week ive already gone through every social media platform available a million times and tried to learn every bit of information i can to cater my personality to what they seem to like i feel terrible about it but ill convince myself its a necessary thing to do each time ive made myself sick with anxiety to the point i cant eat when i go too long without hearing back from them i like to think im pretty good with masking these traits and not imposing my anxieties on the guys i talk to but one way or another things always fail and im left feeling completely worthless and unloveable until i snap out of it and then i hate them and then i move onto the next lmao ive never had a proper relationship and im going on 22 its especially complicated for me because im gay and i often dont feel confident in safely interacting with other men outside of the internet nothing develops naturally for me and even if it did id likely burn it to flames pretty quick im terrified ill always be like this i dont know how to love in a healthy way i feel things so deeply specifically when it comes to romantic attraction and that applies to a deep feeling with every emotion positive and very negative i can be very intense and i feel terrible about it this is becoming a vent post but really im looking for some success stories or advice from those who experience this level of struggle with relationships,post-pandemic

hey everyone checking in again five years after i made this post detailing my experience with health anxiety as i think i mentioned there i dont really use reddit so i apologize for not responding to any of the amazingly supportive comments im doing excellent never relapsed totally moved on etc but thats not what this post is about note i will not be sharing a link to the app im about to talk about i have firmly explained why people with health anxiety should only discuss medical issues with a doctor not google not ai not even family members i completely stand by this and you need to recognize i am writing this as a person who does not have health anxiety anymore please do not ask for a link im a programmer by trade and naturally ive been working heavily with ai i recently made an application with ai that allows you to input your age biological sex location medical history and a list of symptoms you are experiencing and it will spit out the top 5 most likely explanations based on the totality of the information present and the relative likelihood based on the epidemiology in other words based on your agelocationmedical circumstances what is most likely most people including myself when i developed health anxiety think of medicine as a matching game where the disease that best matches their symptoms is the most likely explanation that is completely wrong and not how the world works which is something those of us with health anxiety have to learn the hard way we desperately want an explanation that fits everything into a nice clean box so when we google our symptoms and find a rare disease that exactly matches our symptoms we assume that must be the most likely scenario news flash in reality its much more likely that we are simply suffering from a combination of much more common benign conditions thats where things get interesting i had the idea yesterday to take the exact symptoms and demographic data from when i first developed health anxiety using my original post on here as a reference since i hardly remember the exact details and i plugged it in to the app imagine the shock on my face when the results showed overwhelmingly that my initial symptoms were best explained by anxietypanic disorder extremely likely none of the conditions i thought i had which caused my health anxiety in the first place even made the list at all which implies they were well below a 1 chance not only that but as i started adding more and more of the symptoms that developed as my health anxiety progressed such as my fainting incident in the shower eye issues etc the diagnosis essentially stayed the same and the ai correctly identified all of the completely benign conditions that explained exactly what happened now heres the craziest part i went through hell for the better part of a year multiple er visits overnight hospital stay and more tests than i can count never once did a medical professional mention the word anxiety or panic to me never once i figured out i had anxiety completely on my own and even after explaining to my neurologist that i thought i had figured it out after all this time he completely dismissed me now i am not implying that these medical professionals are not doing their jobs in fact they are doing their jobs perfectly they are running tests and ruling everything out but on the other hand i could have saved myself a lot of suffering if i had even known anxietypanic disorder could potentially explain my situation even to this day googling my initial set of symptoms brings up a host of potentially dangerous and extremely scary diseases that are bound to trigger anxiety whereas an ai that has been told specifically to utilize the relevant demographic data and weigh relative probabilities was quickly able to identify that anxiety was a much more likely explanation in my mind that is pretty damn cool once again dont bother asking for a link as i wont be providing it the moral of this story isnt that you should be using an app to double check if you have health anxiety it is that you need to get it through your head that your thoughts as a nonmedical professional are completely worthless you truly know nothing if you are experiencing what you perceive to be a health crisis get checked out first and then once you get checked out remind yourself that your perceptions are not reality and in this case ai just so happened to be the medium that proved that yet again,post-pandemic
its incredibly soul crushing and devastating when the addict you left and his parents blame you for the addiction and all the trouble that arose because of it even after ive removed myself they are texting me saying they are scared of me and how its basically my fault their son is addicted when he was addicted 5 years before i met himi myself am sober and never had problems just needed to vent somewhere all i did was try to love and help and this just feels like continued abuse and denial,post-pandemic

it has been a few years since i went to treatment and been in recovery etc ive been pretty stable since but of course have had a few small lapses the last few months have been a bit of a struggle though anyways a big thing in treatment and that i see on recovery accounts is challenging fear foods i never have had specific fear foods i will eat only junk food as long as i stay below a certain calorie limit i actually know my ed is creeping around again when i stop eating a good variety of healthy foods and switch to a mostly junk food diet to me it feels like well if i am going to eat something and since i know it will be limited i want to actually have it be something worthwhile wondering if anyone else has this experience because throughout the years this is what has made me feel like my ed is invalid or that i dont actually even have one,post-pandemic

yesterday i was talking to a newer manager about how my old head manager would treat me anytime i would need her assistance it would be met with an annoyed sigh eye roll and a sharp and rude reply when i would ask for instructions or clearer instructions on things i would be met with what i listed before and instead if showing me what to do she would angrily do it herself and leave me in the dark i constantly was made to feel like an idiot by her but then she would turn around and say how much she loved me and how we are like family i was so confused because her attitude towards me constantly changed and i felt like i went from being loved to hated the manager i told this to was absolutely appalled and told me that i didnt deserve to be treated like that and that i should have told him because for the short time those two worked together he would have pulled her aside and reprimanded her he told me that hr should have gotten involved with some of the stuff she did to me and to tell him if anyone treats me like that again the only thing is i dont know how to contact hr and would most likely would have had to ask the old head manager to help i felt trapped because when i did try to bring up problems i had at work it was always directed to her plus part of me thought it was ok for her to do this cause she was also very nice to me at times i thought i had became better at realizing when people were abusive to me ive been treated like this from people ive considered close friends or partners ever since i was little because i struggled and still do with realizing when people abuse me i thought i would finally be able to tell but it happened again i thought i was aware enough but it keeps happening i cant take this forgot to say this but both my old head manager and the manager i talked to are aware im autistic,post-pandemic

over the last few months iv done a lot of work to get better and iv been in therapyon medication for a while but the insecurity and fear my partner is gonna leave has been so immense its been almost physically painful the last few days 3 nights ago i was up late and wanted to reread conversations with my partner we met online and were long distance before i moved closer to him so a huge chunk of our friendship and part of our relationship was online while looking through these messages i found one where he mentioned this old girlfriend of his that he couldnt get overits important i add this was over a year before we got together now hes not the type of person of lie or beat around the bush so he reassured me that was in the past and im the person he wants to be with now i feel like a hypocrite because i have more relationship experience than him and i cant expect him to not have dated prior to us meeting but im still so hurt im even skeptical of him iv had this overwhelming fear hes gonna leave me anyways just wondered what some of you guys do to help during these kinda times thank you for reading all this,post-pandemic
i am an alcoholic i am 24 years old male and am drunk 6 days of the week i am recently unemployed but i have been trying to get a corporate job for months i was not fired from my most recent job due to being intoxicated it was a job that only lasts for one summer i spend my days interviewing with companies sober but i cannot land a job i am not creating this post because of my failure to get hired im creating this post because i wanted to see if there is anyone out there that can give me some advice on how to quit drinking because it has made me depressed but is the only thing that makes me happy when im depressed i drink anytime that i do not have to interact with someone who doesnt know im an alcoholic which is pretty much everyday since i just stay in my apartment alone and wait for my roommate to get home from work around 5 oclock i have a girlfriend who knows that i drink and i have asked her for help about my addiction but she doesnt really say anything except the typical girlfriend stuff like okay im here for you if you need help i am close with both parents and my two sisters but cannot reach out to them because i am too embarrassed i have dozens of friends that will help me but i am too embarrassed they dont know but if they did learn my other friends would somehow find out and having people talk about me behind my back might be worse than being an alcoholic ive thought about going to rehab but everyone i know would ask about my absence and the word would quickly spread about me going to rehab i dont want that x200b x200b if it gets bad enough that i need to go to rehab i will but if someone has any advice that can tell me how to quietly stop my addiction without any of my fiends and family knowing that i have problem i would greatly appreciate it,post-pandemic

sorry if its a dumb or insensitive question so if you know you have health anxiety doesnt that fact mean you know youre probably actually physically fine and on the flip side if youre having real chronic symptoms why would you presume you have ha physical symptoms cause legitimate anxiety and i think people sometimes flip that around ive never seen a good enough evidence that anxiety can cause chronic symptoms while it is obvious to me it can cause acute symptoms for me ive developed several neurological symptoms this last year and tried to cling to the anxiety explanation however i dont find it really holds water and as time goes by its getting more obvious to me that im developing some kind of neuropathy probably sfn fibromyalgia so what do you think how do you know if youre an anxious person thinking hes sick or a sick person getting legitimately anxious,post-pandemic

to start this i would like to explain why i may be drawn to uppers in the first place my mother father brother and uncle are all addicted to meth its the midwest the shit grows on trees here ive never tried meth and i never plan to but when i took adderall for the first few times i felt pure euphoria and it only got better after getting a 50 mg vyvanse prescription because then i had a steady supply to abuse i began losing weight feeling confident and being extremely social i loved it because im usually a shy reserved person and this drug made me feel like king mf kong so naturally i took 2 one day then 2 everyday then 3 ff to tonight and ive taken 90 mg of adderall plus my 50 mg vyvanse the benefits of the drug are long gone and theres nothing but misery and yapping in it for me anymore tbh i need to quit i want to quit but whats the point if i just end up in the same shitty life that makes me abuse pills in the first place how do i get over this if anyones been through this please respond i could use the support it makes for great reading material when im super high nah jk ps ive been abusing alcohol marijuana and anything except opiates and meth for around 3 years the vyvanse and adderall started around a year ago and ive sank further than i ever imagined i would with drugs i hate this but its the only thing making me feel alive right now i dont know if i have the strength to quit but at least i can post my feelings to reddit,post-pandemic

i was given the taste of beer at the age of 15 i turned towards alcohol when i was 18 since then till now i have been a drinker i have also been a chain smoker for nearly 7 years i quit smoking last year in august and ive been cigarette free for 6 months now ive posted in this sub before too i have lost control with alcohol i seem to never be able to stop once i start it has been a relation of going back and forth with alcohol consumption for me since last 2 years i am currently 26 years old and i am going through feelings of guilt and shame i hosted a party 2 days ago at my home for my family relatives we finished one bottle and hopped onto the next one drank until i was sloshed out and then got into an argument and spoke a few disrespectful words to my relatives my wife and other family members said they werent even able to look at me thats how drunk i was i love drinking i do admit that but i have this problem where some days i just cant seem to stop once started some days i drink responsibly but some days i just dont stop now i have an ocean of guilt and shame inside me after the night of the party i apologized to my family the next day and i did decide to put a break on my alcohol consumption for sometime now i have still those feelings of guilt and shame i am a very responsible person in my personal and professional life apart from the drinking part and hence it pricks me more that someone like me allowed alcohol to ruin relationships my self esteem and confidence i have been wanting to get it out of my chest and i did not want to speak with any of my friends about this so i decided to pen down my thoughts in here i am fucking sorry for the way i fell prey to vices i had a very tough life i had to work at an early age to support my family i worked and finished my education at the same time did overnight work extra work went through the worst stages of life to pull my family out of poor financial conditions and give everyone a better life but in no way i should have used alcohol as an excuse to cope with hardships of life im at a difficult stage right now where i have stopped alcohol consumption right now because of how i feel about all this but i deep down know that i love to drink i am just wondering what loop this is thank you for reading this i will come back stronger,post-pandemic

i have so many long long nights where i just cant sleep when i close my eyes i just imagine all the plenty of different ways i might kill myself just grab a knife and shove it through the side of my throat as i drown and choke in my own blood or walk to the bridge over the highway and finally have the courage to climb and jump or to open every single medicine bottle at home and just take every single one i just wish for some peace and quiet and the thing is i dont think all that many people will care that much if i died or so maybe i just tell myself so i can finally go through with it i hate the agony and fear of going back and forth and back and forth of how and when and why i could kill myself over and over and over again staying alive hurt and sucks and theres never any guarantee its going to get better and its always think about the people you will leave behind or the future you can have the people i will leave behind will be sad and will miss me when im dead but i need them to miss me when im alive if i had a future i wanted to live for i wouldnt be in this mental space anyway it just feels like i have to suffer to keep others happy when i dont want to suffer anymore when i die how will people remember me probably as a failure someone too weak to continue someone manipulative someone evil someone just not good enough its just too much for me i just want a quiet nights sleep for once my in life is that too much to ask for,post-pandemic

i excelled in school for most of my childhood until late 4th and 5th grade my parents split the summer going into 5th grade and the breakup was ugly my dad was already a drug addict and abusive before this but it became significantly worse after they split in my 5thgrade year i spent time in survival mode for whatever reason and i began struggling in school especially in math i tried everything and every night i had math homework it was hours spent with my mom that would ultimately end up in arguing and crying which did cause damage to my mom and is relationship going between my mom and is rocky relationship and then living with my dad the other half of the time where i was being emotionally abused and neglected i stopped prioritizing school i failed the 5th grade but was waived on to middle school since then i have struggled in school especially in math i cheated in math through school to get a passing grade i graduated with my associates degree last year but now im working on my bachelors degree when i found out i would be required to take two more math credits it now has me seriously contemplating dropping out of college the thought of taking more math courses makes me anxious and cry every time i try to consider it i feel so silly trying to explain this to others and they always reply with ill help you or you can get a tutor when thats not the issue i feel like i have a mental block and the information wont be retained because i get reminded of what life was like for me at that time its frustrating for me i want to become a therapist so badly but feel so stunted by other people because i cant get ahead of this one thing holding me back i wish there was a way for me to get waived from the courses but obviously thats not possible its so overwhelming and i feel extremely embarrassed and just ultimately defeated hopefully this makes sense im going to talk with my therapist about this next week im hoping someone else on here will relate and that im not alone in this ive already been diagnosed with ptsd and i try to be sensitive to myself but i get so frustrated thinking about this,post-pandemic

hello im 18f and i was wondering if my anxiety medication could be the cause for my everyday chest paindiscomfort and tightness im taking 5mg of buspirone for the last two months and ever since ive started taking it everyday for almost the past two months ive experienced all kinds of weird chest related painstightnessrandom pressures that move around my entire chestbuzzingtrouble breathingsharp pain in right side of chest with i take deep breathsetc it was really bad when it first started and i believe i did have painful heartburn for a couple of days but after that it went away and then this ive already tried explaining what im feeling on other forums here on reddit out of desperation hoping to find some sort of answer ive been told that i might have costochondritis after i posted on here that i went to the doctors and was told it was intercostal muscle strain and was prescribed ibuprofen 400mg and arthritis cream and was told that it should go away in a couple days spoiler it didnt and the ibuprofen did absolutely nothing and neither did the cream and so i thought that might be it but surely not i mean it all went downhill for me after i started taking the buspirone ive already scheduled a cardiologist splint for this month just to make sure its nothing serious but i doubt it after two months so i wanted to come on here again to see if anyone else had this problem with this medication and its not just me going crazy ive tried to stop taking it but my mom said that its all in my head and that its cause i keep thinking about it and thats why it wont go away which doesnt even make any sense but sure if you say so and im also scared cause of possible effects that could happen if i suddenly stop taking it ps im also taking concerta 18mg for adhd also im sure its not costochondritis cause my pain is not located in the same areas as where costo appears,post-pandemic
hi for a little background context i am an 18 year old girl who is newly diagnosed with bpd but i had been aware that i most likely had this disorder before i was diagnosed and my psychiatrist had hinted at it as well i am also studying abroad for a semester in a foreign country and i do not really know anyone here i have been in an on and off relationship for about a year now with my boyfriend 19 from the moment we met each other we were inseparable and i feel like that made me so much more clingy and dependent on him than i have been in previous relationships when we are apart it feels like i am dying and i cannot focus on anything or be productive in any way i feel so sad and neglected when he goes to hang out with friends and family and i know that is not right of me he is currently going on vacation for a week and i am losing my mind we are currently long distance since i am abroad but we call and text for hours everyday my whole entire life revolves around him and i do not know how to cope with him leaving i have isolated myself from almost all my friends and completely ruined my sleep i stay up all night and sleep during the day because we currently have an 8hr time difference it is also hard for me to just make new friends since i am extremely shy and have pretty bad social anxiety my midterms are coming up at the end of the month and i just want to be able to study and do well but i cannot because i am just constantly feeling awful since i am away from my boyfriend i dont know how i am going to cope with him leaving and i am scared to be left to my own devices i cannot keep living like this i love him so much with all my heart but i also feel so sad and alone and i know it unhealthy to be this reliant on someone please i need advice what do you do when you are separated from your fp and how to you continue to function when it feels like a part of you is missing i would love some tips on what you guys do to keep yourself distracted and happy ps sorry if this is confusing or badly worded i am frantically typing this as he is boarding the plane,post-pandemic

sorry if this question might be offensive in any way i hope its not but i started drinking a few months ago because of catastrophical life situation and i thought most drunks went that way because of similar reasons yet i see some people here having stories of their lives being perfect before starting with spouses houses kids white fences the whole nine yards but then they started chugging bottles of whiskey all day every day and it all went down the drain is it some biologicalchemical craving how does it feel i ask for in my case its strictly psychological i dont get cravings for ethanol as a substance just the cravings for being intoxicated i dont even like the taste and had no ethanol cravings when i had other equivalents,post-pandemic
today was my birthday two of my closest friends have really upset me one of them straight up didnt wish me happy birthday this is after us basically have no contact with each other for months so idk if they are even my friend anymore the other one did wish me happy birthday but only because i posted to my snap story saying that it was my birthday lol if i hadnt posted it they probably wouldnt have even known it was my birthday but i see they posted a huge insta story basically with pictures and everything wishing their other friend a happy birthday im just wondering why tf i get a simple happy birthday message and someone else gets a whole spectacle with public acknowledge and everything they are also back in town this weekend to celebrate another friends birthday and i bet celebrating with me didnt even cross their fucking mind if i even asked theyd have some bullshit why they wouldnt be able to these are people who ive often went out of my way to talk to and say hello to over snap cause one lives across the state and the other one goes to college a couple states away but even when they are home they find excuses to not hang out with me what have i done wrong why does no one seem to actually care about me why do people want nothing to do with me i deserve way better then this and im starting to resent them a bit how hard is it for people to act like they give a shit about me if this is how life is gonna treat me i dont wanna be here anymore idk how long i can go feeling like i dont matter to these people i just want to matter to someone,post-pandemic
i have been abusing so many things in my life that i cant even keep track my saving grace is the fact that i cant possibly keep all of my addictions at the same time so some have been rotating in and out of my life the ones i liked the least i was able to get over entirely i am not even sure if other people can relate but i get insanely enthusiastic about anything i like which generally means i abuse something until i get so sick of it that i need to abuse something else am i doomed to live in this circle one of the biggest addictions in my life has been alcohol i have been drinking regularly 2x per week at least for 16 years now luckily it doesnt work for me as it used to the negatives outweigh the positives now and i noticed that i am drinking less now i feel ready to have a 3 month break after my next big social event but honestly my mind is already searching for something else to abuse i was able to steer that craving towards sports a few times in my life but i overdid it so much that i got injured a few times already currently recovering from a ligament injury on the other hand i am trying to get into healthy eating but then i can feel my lizard brain just craving unhealthy comfort food the drug i am most terrified of is ketamine i love it so much that i would love to have it every single day i told myself that i will never do it again because i know that i dont even stand a chance to use it in moderation but sometimes i think yo maybe i should just indulge in it once a week if it helps me stay distracted from my other addictions how are yall just balanced human beings that enjoy things in moderation,post-pandemic
i have an incredibly patient husband hes put up with my bpd when it was undiagnosed for the past 9 years i have no doubt that he would be incredibly patient and kind with our child too he really wants to try for a child in the very near future i would absolutely love to have a baby and i think i intend to but im so scared i feel like i can barely care for myself sometimes and how will that translate as a mom will i lose my mind and fly off the handle and spiral and cause everything to implode will i become so overwhelmed that i become suicidal at the drop of a hat has anyone here been successful as a bpd parent i see so often how parents with bpd can have an adverse impact on their child and i just dont want to cause them any trauma even unintentionally the same way my bpd mom did any advice would be appreciated eta i have been in continuous treatment for anxietydepressionadhd since childhood but was finally diagnosed with bpd recently im a therapist myself and i greatly prioritize treatment,post-pandemic
i would like to hear your advice i am 19 years old i always used to have addictive tendencies i tried many substances however i never got strongly addicted to one now i dont do anything not even weed or alcohol everything i do has a kind of compulsive drive as if i cling on something even healthy things such as reading sports writing drawing i have chronic pain 247 tension headaches and mental health problems currently i am on deprivation from porn sex and heavy unnecessary social media use i really dont know what to do with my time now like i cant always read listen to audiobooks go for walks do sports or bodyawareness exercises these are good for me and i enjoy it but its just too much doing more would feel compulsive i dont know what to put my energy in i feel like im bursting without anything to do might be the dopamine deprivation but anyways i got to do something just what anything like writing drawing reading ect feels like im only doing it because ive got nothing else to do it feels compulsive like im filling a void also i really dont feel like meeting new people or a lot of people i dont have a social problem its just a life period of introspection calm and reorientation on my needs and interests additionally i made the decision to no longer search for someone or something specific in terms of relationships that just adds stress and decreases intimacy in this topic of my life i just let happen whatever happens also i cant spend more time just being with the moment feeling everything the moment offers this is very difficult with my conditions and as i mentioned already plus im doing that enough probably too much already i feel like all this time i have for sensing my body and myself is making me odd its just too much for my age i need to do something but i dont know what any advice,post-pandemic

okay so let me start by saying i am 24m and have been using crack primarily as well as various other drugs i started using in excess in the summer of the year i had turned 18 for some reason i figured i was immune to the ill effects from drugs at this point i mean what could possibly go wrong with inhaling gram lines of blow dozens of times for days at a time aka binging i remember being almost fascinated the first time i experienced the tactile hallucinations feeling spiders crawling on my arm after also not sleeping for around a week then looking and actually seeing them instead of the previous hallucinations in the peripheral vision clearly wasnt sure exactly how off the wall that was at the time but to continue after id say about 1 12 2 years of snorting i graduated to the pipe which unsurprisingly brought me to a different type of nightmare i will never forget glossing over details of it i spent nearly 8 months in drug induced psychosis without even knowing what psychosis was ngl i find that a bit funny now cause like what the fuck lmao 8 months ended in me trying to kill myself routinely all leading to one very sincere attempt that evidently didnt work at this time im 21 and remember being in the psych ward and leveling with myself cause when you really ask yourself whats more likely whole worlds out to get ya or maybe just maybe ur smoking too much fuckin crack anyways from 2124 ive spent just over a year off the rocks not consecutively and why i write this is because i have gradually cut down immensely on my usage although theres many compounding aspects to this which hopefully doesnt make it too convoluted ive admittedly been wasting potential and time shocker which leads me to believe many of my friends from over the years understandably wish not to associate with a crackhead regardless of a fond history before they were a crackhead now this is where drawing the line becomes an issue for me because i know that i do have friends family that want me back the real me not some fuckin crack goblin loser leading me to believe that some have come together to trip me the fuck out every time they can get a chance while im under the influence theres a ridiculous variety of ways to approach it drones malware voice changers ai scripts which raises the question who actually would invest that much into it like i said im aware what im saying is out there although theres some people out there who are lonely and get quite bored only extent of themselves essentially being on the internet i can still notice these type of things once the effects of the drug wear off though which is why im becoming skeptical basically chillin everythings normal everyones normal take the hit got multiple people trying to talk to me simultaneously as well as talking incomprehensibly asking me to do multiple tasks at a time i get mad overwhelmed bug out no bueno crack wears off but people are still acting weird ive been buying into the whole tweaker character in excess in order to see the results which is another reason im genuinely unsure of the objective truth here x200b if you have any insight or comments or questions run it up thanks big city spider,post-pandemic

i noticed that my health anxiety gets worse every single day so in conclusion that would mean the ha influences itself i dont know how it is for everyone else but for me there seems no other particular reason that makes my ha worse when im actually sick it gets worse for a while but the constant rising of the anxiety around it doesnt really have an explanation other than the brain just thinking more and more about tge health and being aware of every little change in the body does anyone has thoughts or knowledge about it or does anyone experience it differently,post-pandemic
i was approached on friday by a nabour of mine in a full on episode break down im not sure if shes been diagnosed in the passed but i was with her as she come to me as someone she knows as a safe person for her completely unknown to me shes been watching me for the last 7 years from the window outside she lives in a block of flats next to me i have seen her in the street over the years i was trying to work out the situation i was in all in the moment as she was completey breathless couldnt speak seeing things voices ect i managed to get the situation under control pretty fast and we sat down and had a good chat for 3 or 4 hours while we were waiting for help to arrive from the ambulance she was telling me about the voices and other things she can see and hear ect and shes been awake for weeks not eating and scared i quickly changed the conversation to something positive once i listened to her she thinks shes been followed her phones being hacked and shes got 10000s of videos and photos on her phone of what she can seeand hear ect i had a quick look to show i was understanding her but its obviously all delusion again i changed the conversation to something positive now i need to ask some of you this ended at 6pm friday when i left for a weekend away i told her to come back and see me on monday afternoontomarrow and left her with doctors and ambulance crew she told me that she feels i am someone she sees in her mind as a safe person so i dont want to get seen with anyone who shes seeing as a bad person to her i must give her some sort of relief being someone who sees as good i quickly got the situation of her crisis under control as once the ambulance arrived it was almost like nothing had happened the story is abit longer than this but it was a full episode to her can anyone give me any advice how i can move forward obviously shes going to need some sort of medication or something out of my control should i even bother to approach her in the future or would i be better off waiting to see if she ever comes back over to me i dont want her to be someone i see when shes at full on crisis point only if i can help it but im happy to take advice from others living with this mental health condition thank you,post-pandemic

hi everyone im sure you might have heard my case countless times before and ill try as much as i can to make it brief but im in a very tough spot of having a lot of questions about autism neurodivergence in general and where do i fit in this whole thing im at the point of highly suspecting that i might be on the autism spectrum and from what ive found from researching the next step was to talk to a community also an important note before anything when it comes to seeing a professional its kind of near impossible at the moment financial and geographic reasons and to be clear im not looking for a diagnosis here i just want to talk to the people who know more about this than im hopefully to gain more knowledge about it im a 19yearold male and up until recently i didnt know much about autism beyond the stereotypes and misconceptions i have always been dealing with some social issues sensitivity issues loneliness stuff hyperfixations but i never thought of linking them all to autism because my understanding of autism was this extreme thing talking to people about those things would almost always lead to them replying with something along the lines of yeah weve all been there its a matter of experience you just need to expose yourself to more social situations and youll get used to it which yeah maybe but not really do you consider the set if responses that i memorised to say in curtain situations which i sometimes mix up improvement then i came across a video on youtube from one of the creators i follow talking about their experience with autism and it resonated so much with my own experience and from this video i went on a journey of bing watching every youtube video about autism but theres a part of me thats still denying this that all of this might just be a bunch of weird quirks that coincidentally happened to exist together in one person and i know the only way to know for sure is to talk to a professional but as i said its tough at the moment but ill definitely keep working towards it anyway and i want to end this post with this recently i started to fill a note book with what is essentially a thousand and one reasons i might be autistic and here are some of them 1 i find it really hard to articulate my thoughts even if i have full understanding of what im talking about it makes things like presentations and discussions really hard and thats why i never win a debate on anything and i always stutter in any casual conversation 2 im a part of multiple friend groups and im a completely different person with each even the words i use and the sound of my laugh changes to mimic the people in the group 3 loud places are so loud and since i was very young i felt mild discomfort in any crowded space and walking through them alone was always terrifying to me and it makes me feel my entire body shiver 4 im so godamn sensitive i dont enjoy the things that most people enjoy because of that which either makes me left out of my group theyre all boys they love to do stupid crap or theyd constantly remind me of how boring im i just want to sit down somewhere and talk about space for five hours guys 5 i love my room i love my personal space and i get so damn hostile when someone exists in my room for more than three seconds or touch my things i love being home in my comfy clothes not having to leave i love everything to be in its place and if anything moves for any reason i panic and i hate sudden changes and unexpected events 6 im very introspective and my brain is fired up and running at illegal speeds 247 and i have thousands of notes on my phone with imaginary scenarios and conversations random cool sentences and some wierd thoughts speaking of imaginary conversations i have those all the time 7 i have the coolest dreams not sure if it has something to do with anything i just wanted to mention that i think thats enough theres definitely more but you can only write so much in a reddit post im sharing this because i know some people went through similar experiences and im curious to hear from you thank you for reading,post-pandemic

there appears to be some sort of confusion about what my actual issue is when i did my intake a few months ago i told him about restricting and what my calorie limits were no numbers but certainly less than a healthy amount but also that i havent been counting lately to try and recover i also told him that i have a history of purging or using laxatives when i go over those calorie limits but again its something i havent been doing in an effort to recover and since moving in with new people last time i was in treatment i was at a higher bmi than i am now and diagnosed with anbp because i was restricting and purging when i had anything i considered to be too much this time i was diagnosed with bulimia he said because my bmi is normal and i have a history of purging since starting weve been doing cbte worksheets its basically a food log where i indicate if i felt like the meal was too much if i purged and then write about the contextfeelings i am not allowed to write the calories though as someone who has a long history of keeping food diaries this is pretty easy for me to do but has led to more restriction and writing down the food also makes me judge the quantities higher so ive been indicating that food is too much pretty frequently still not purging though since starting the logs ive lost a not insignificant amount of weight im not sure if hes only reading the feelings portion and not what i eat or what but the majority of our time seems to be focused on reducingcontrolling my binges except that i rarely if ever binge to me finishing a normally portioned meal feels like too much so ill indicate it on the log and we focus so much on those indications and specifically on how i can say no when people offer me meals i dont want to eat and stop the finish the plate mentality that i have which yeah sure feeling obligated to finish meals is definitely an issue but it feels basically like im being given restriction tips shouldnt he be encouraging me to not feel bad about eating meals and in fact to eat more honestly im not sure how to address this i brought up once before that i dont think i should be treated for bulimia because thats not really my problem i forget what he said though the stupid ed brain solution is to just keep restricting until im underweight and meet the diagnostic criteria for anorexia which i told him that plan but again i forget how the conversation went but the end result of that plan is still recovery because i do want to get better wanting to doesnt seem to be enough though and i need help feeling comfortable with normal portions and meal times it feels like im getting the opposite of that right now other than that though im really glad to be in therapy because its hard to get treatment in my city and im really lucky that he took me on as a patient right after intake wait time after intake is usually 6 months hes leaving the practice in july so i imagine ill go on another waitlist when that happens so in the meantime i dont want to quit,post-pandemic
so i have had a pair of anxiety crisis on last monday and wednesday and since then this tensional headache appeared and havent gone away its a pressure and both sides of my head plus in the back of my head a bit of dizziness at times and also a subtle warmness in my head it appears only during the night too both yesterday and today i woke up feeling normal and thought the pain would not return i have a pair of job related stuff to deliver one this monday and another on thuesday so perhaps it is this that is causing this tension since stuff like that tend to make me nervous its my first job so maybe these job stuff are weightening since i was already coming from a fragilized state since mondaywednesday but yet it is making me slightly fearful because my tensional headaches always lasted 1 to 3 days im going to a doctor tomorrow just to make sure but would be good to hear the feedback of you too my fears is that due to the intense stress of last monday and wednesday ive caused some injury to my brain etc or then that a teeth ive treated recently is causing an infection but the teeth hurts very very little only now and then and its a very subtle pain almost unnoticeable it seems to be fine i guess my time to start taking some medicines to anxiety definitely came sorries for the nonperfect english not my mother tongue,post-pandemic

hi this is half a question half a vent this is a second account english is not my main language feel free to skip it if you immediately want to answer the question so i 17f have been suspicious i was autistic for a few years i have tried to speak about the subject with my parents but they always dismiss it immediately they words no youre too normal you have friends same thing happened with one of my friend who said i was too normal for that i understand their concern im a young girl in her teenage years and they probably believe i am searching for a feeling of belonging the problem is they think im too normal but i get reminders everyday of how different and out of place i am like im not autistic but i get laughed at everything i dont get a figurative joke or im not autistic but my parents complain i pace in my room for hours every single day and never invite friends over or how they know i literally stop talking when overwhelmed with strong emotions i have been showing clear signs of being more than different since childhood lack of socialisation crying and hitting everyone when i didnt understand getting hurt over nothing early depressive episodes interests in peculiar subjects deep attachment to routine schedules sense hell in primary and secondary school i was on a list teachers passed between eachother for troubled kids and noted as heavily sensible dont ask her to talk she wont its like they choose to be blind and look away i feel people just go nah you can to talk to people without running away so you cant be autistic like autism is some sort of evil sickness you shouldnt be asking about it really hurts because everyday every time i talk every time im outside i get reminded of how fucking weird i am how i will never fit because i just cant look at people in the eye i cant talk without preparing the whole conversation beforehand improvising anything drains me and i always get these comments on how when i look at people it looks like a dead stare so anyways do you get the impression that people are in denial of bizarre traits,post-pandemic

ive always find it weird that only women tend to be diagnosed with bpd since its a mental disorder and can affect anyone ive been thinking that its maybe because men are expected to be more macho and stoic by society and also testosterone filled which makes their symptoms manifest as aggresion violence anger issues and substance issues which would look really similar to aspd and maybe they get misdiagnosed a lot are there any men here with bpd if yes what are your symptoms edit sorry shouldve worded it better female predominant not femalespecific,post-pandemic
i used to be very talkative and now i cant even think of anything to say is this due to braindamage that comes with psychosis i believe that my brain is dead and i will never be the person i was before cognitive decline sucks and where the hell did my thoughts go whenever im in a position where i have to talk i go mute when i was psychotic for the first time i remember that i could recall what was happening to me in psychward ever since they did this chemical labatomy on me ive went mute i think its either brain damage or antipsychotics that messed me up we are taking poison for our bodies just so society can feel safe but we are the ones suffering for them all i rather be psychotic and believe that im a wizard then die in a slow and agonizing pain,post-pandemic

i made so much progress i went to community college instead of university to keep myself sober in therapy and accountable by the end of the first semester i was a bit over it but nothing too bad then i fell into depression and relapsed with drugs doing a lot of oxy but 30s are never really 30s it stopped helping i started school again and the first two weeks i had one class and i could manage it was nice to have something to do because of my depression i signed up really really late so all my classes were virtual without any real lectures you teach yourself from the textbook learning statistics is hard like that and i couldnt even try my first class was about drugs and substance abuse and i think just ended up being a trigger my last class is a poetry class and its the only one im somewhat following i want to drop them give up in a way and let life be my therapist says its a bad idea because everything will go down funny how i only open up in the last 10 minutes of therapy and then feel so fucked up and vulnerable when i leave the oxy isnt doing anything anymore coke feels mediocre im not doing an insane amount like i used to i have been craving meth which is like the worst drug and i hate that i know it will fuck up everything i feel like it would just speed up the inevitable i also stopped taking my meds 2 weeks ago i know youre probably thinking im an idiot and i am its crazy how fast shit changes i was paranoid and manicy like 5 days ago i feel like life is never getting better i want it to i just want to be cared about but that kind of care that i want isnt healthy or sustainable especially from the people in my life lol if u read all that thanks i just desperately need support and advice brutal advice tbh,post-pandemic

hi there i 23f dont have ptsd but im 97 sure my friendpartner type person 26m does i have questions and i thought the best people to ask would be people who deal with it themselves let me start by saying he has not been diagnosed but he is in the military so they dont exactly prioritize mental health and he would know as he works in behavioral health based on the life experiences he has told me about i dont see how he couldnt be traumatized by it but heres the situation and you can tell me if im way off or not i wont go into gory details its not my story to tell tldr every year this week my friend ghosts and idk if its bc of trauma or not and idk what to do we did date in 2022 he was always open and honest about his experiences and trauma and talked about his feelings he was previously married and i think that she did a lot of damage ill spare specifics we talked about it if he wanted to but i never pressed him for more details than he wanted to give he dealt with a lot of depression that got significantly worse during the winter we broke up last february he said he just couldnt focus on any more than himself we went no contact for 8 months and started talking again in september this time we didnt go right back to dating and stayed in this weird morethanfriends limbo thing he said he was doing better mentally and i did see an improvement until winter came i finally noticed that he has cycles twoish weeks of hypomania and then two weeks of even worse depression it gets more noticeable in the winter i thought maybe bipolar but someone pointed out that people with severe trauma can also exhibit this cyclical behaviour so i stopped taking it personally if he didnt talk to me as much and kept track of which week it was i never bring it up but im aware for my own sanity im a very anxious person however this week is one of his down weeks ive heard absolutely nothing from him that is unusual usually i get at least one text in the morning he said hes busy which i believe to an extent the thing is we broke up this week last year and he was acting the exact same and used the exact same excuse he was in fact not doing anything so im wondering if maybe something happened during this week at some point in his life and it will always be a worse mood week for him is that a thing every year at the same time of year as a traumatic event i know especially last year at this time he wanted to unalive so idk if its that or if its something that happened before im giving him his space hes very avoidant and im not going to push him but i do occasionally just ask for proof of life i have a theory that it will get a little better once the seasonal sad gets less severe im the same way in the regard but until then i want to support him without smothering or hovering is there a better way for me to support him am i doing anything that could be potentially harmful in december he had told me that im doing a great job at respecting his boundaries and being supportive so i cant imagine this is my fault but i just want to make sure,post-pandemic

i am addicted to meth and alcohol i have been clean from meth for three days but alcohol is a whole other story due to its dangerous physical withdrawal symptoms the problem i have is that no one will take me in for a short 3 day detox period just to get the worst of the physical issues out of the withdrawals doctors keep telling me that i need to get into a 30day program and refuse to prescribe detox meds which it ridiculous not everyone can go to inpatient rehab the outpatient program told me that as long as i can be detoxified from alcohol they will accept me how the hell can i detox on my own when no doctors will prescribe the damn benzodiazepines to get me through the withdrawal period i know benzos are addictive i get that but for fucks sake i keep trying to tell these damn doctors that benzos are the only drug that i do not even like i actually hate taking benzos because they make me feel like a zombie but i detoxed years ago and they were lifesavers for me it is incredibly frustrating to be delegitimized just because i am an addict and please do not tell me that i am in denial i am not in denial i work for a large corporation that has tons of politics involved and going on leave from work would result in me losing my job and please dont tell me there is job protection for these kinds of things yes on paper there is job protection in place but an employer can find ways to push you out the door if they want to i would go to inpatient rehab if it were a choice i do not have a family or support system that will help me through this in the event that i lost my job losing my job would mean being homeless so please dont tell me that it is better to lose my job than my life i was homeless years ago and the trauma i experienced completely fucked me up in the head i barely made it out of homelessness alive and highly doubt i can do it again i would rather be dead than homeless,post-pandemic

i struggle with social anxiety not knowing what to say sometimes missing hintsmost of all flirting ive become good friends with a female coworker since early december we talk often mostly personal subjects theres always joking smiling and laughing i now know i like her id assume this was all friendly if it werent for differences in how she is around me vs others i upped my playfulness whenever we chat and she plays along other times shes sort of anxious she has anxiety too though ive noticed more little signs like blushing glances looking downlaughing when we talk she often comes over to me to talk we had a funny encounter a few nights ago after work first time meeting outside it i was waiting near a corner of a nearby restaurant unexpectedly she bumped into me while going towards a shop and got jump scaredi was panicking due to liking her when she saw it was me she immediately broke into laughter with me not at me she jokingly asked if i was i waiting to ambush her then exclaimed im telling evvvveryone with a huge grin my face was probably so red i quickly played back please dont ill actually quit etc which made her laugh more but it was in good fun then we talked more and said goodnight would it be acceptable to ask her if shed want to talk in private at the end of the day to ask her out i dont want to ask her anything like that around other people out of respect for her our friendship i believe is sturdy enough that it wouldnt be impacted by it not working out it would definitely end up being something we laugh about,post-pandemic

tw alcoholic parents spoiler it does turn out to be a rant hi i hope this isnt going to turn out being a rant i just need to write some stuff down i know that alcoholism has some stereotypes and that it typically looks a certain way and we typically categorize the nonstereotypical other way as functioning alcoholism in that context both of my parents were functioning alcoholics both made me live hell on earth growing up and neither would admit that they were terribly addicted to the sweet feeling of relief whenever they sat down for the night for their drinks for my dad the last drink was whenever he couldnt hold himself together when he eventually got tired of cursing my mom out and went to bed to curse me out as it was my turn in his head for my mom it was getting blackout drunk every night i genuinely have no clue how she kept this up for so many years and how her body didnt collapse after a certain point im thankful theyre both fine but the memories theyve left behind are still scars that i carry eventually they got separated and my mom had a sleeve gastrectonomy operation a few years later leaving her unable to drink alcohol for a year i cant find words to explain how relieved i was to learn this and how anxious and scared i was because i didnt believe she could do it to my surprise she managed to stay completely sober for over 8 months it was the best 8 months of my life then her doctor told her that the one year rule was just a random amount of time he made up to make his patients quit bad addictions i love how he thought that would work i love how i thought things had changed we had an incident we went to a bring what youre going to drink event where my mom insisted on bringing a bottle of wine to accompany the few bottles of beer i was bringing for myself i filled her glasses carefully as a server in a luxury restaurant would she had been sober for a while and i didnt want her to experience what being drunk was like at this stage of her life we left early and she wanted to buy a bottle of whiskey from the store on our way back i was completely terrified i begged her not to i really did try to stop myself from begging but i couldnt relive the things i did i couldnt see her lose herself again we still live together for context and so after hiding the bottle she had bought for a short while i gave her the entirety i had considered pouring it down the drain and told her that i trusted her a few months later it was my birthday and my friend gifted me a small bottle of gin i kept it in the fridge until today 2 months later im not doing so well and wanted to make myself a small cocktail to make myself feel better to spoil myself the bottle was empty the 2 beers i had drunk prior to this moment evaporated from my body i was completely sobered up and in shock i genuinely could not believe she would do this to me again i know what that empty bottle means i know why she left it there for me to see i know what shes trying to do i know shes trying to hurt me because in some ways she feels like i hurt her as i said were living together and im 25 im unable to move out due to the housing crisis and am trying to save some money in the process shes aware that im extremely prone to panic attacks and have ocd behaviors especially related to my living space my therapist claims so she has never been respectful of my boundaries related to these two issues which are probably results of her functioning alcoholism to begin with i have tried to communicate my boundaries to her in a variety of ways guided by my therapist i know she left the bottle there to make me feel ashamed that i set boundaries with her i know her i know how her head works i just thought it was over i was so happy i do blame myself for her relapse and i blame myself for not being a better daughter to her i genuinely wish i didnt have to set any boundaries and would be okay with anything its so crazy how we think nighttime drinking is ok and therefore not categorized as alcoholism just because someone can stay sober for the day waiting for the sun to go down does not mean theyre not an alcoholic x200b,post-pandemic
i think i just annoyed myself out of a job i did have some occasional outbursts of anger but it was always due to stress from the job itself and stress i put onto myself to hit metrics and follow procedures and enforce policies but lately ive been just too clingy asking too many questions to my boss desperately wanting to get feedback from my colleagues and my boss and specifically getting too closetoo awkward to my fp who i also work with now im scared that all of this is gonna lead to them letting me go they let go of one manager recently and have already promoted another one presumably to take her place and they also recently rehired another manager who had been here before so either the rehire or the new manager are my replacement and its because i cant get my shit together because of this stupid fucking brain of mine constantly overthinking and being paranoid and then lashing out or isolating even when i get what i want recognition and praise and respect from others around me none of it is ever enough and im just too toxic to be around for a long period of time,post-pandemic

im writing a story and a big part of it focuses on mental health in varying forms i want to include a character with schizophrenia but i dont have schizophrenia and i dont know anyone with it so i thought here would be the best place to ask about how i should go about portraying it and for recommendations on the best sources for good information for added context the character i am making is not a villain nor a bad person im also not trying to make his entire character about schizophrenia i just want to know how i should incorporate it into his character naturally without it feeling forced misrepresented or like a spectacle whilst also being able to discuss problems that may arise because of it telling me about anything i should or shouldnt include would be great id really appreciate recommendations for good videos articles books ect on schizophrenia that i could use as references id love to be better informed on this and i know i could look things up but i really dont want to get false information on this subject so i thought asking here for more details would be safer then trusting whatever i find on google,post-pandemic

hello so i have always since i can remember had a very intense reaction if i sawexperienced someone really drunk as a kid i would start shaking all over and was scared shitless my single mother didnt drink much a glass of wine every few months but even in those instances i would cry if i saw her with that glass my father whom i visited every couple of weeks drank a lot sometimes he had a rowdy bar and although i dont remember if something bad happened to me there i know he sometimes took me there when i was very very little and would work while i was sitting somewhere my grandfather was an alcoholic i remember him being difficult and a general air of fear of everyone in the evening where he would drink when i would visit my grandparents now when i see someone really drunk i get a physical response that is not at all proportional to whats happening ill see a girl whos completely blacked out drunk and my heart rate goes absolutely crazy i start shaking i begin crying hysterically and i have these overwhelming emotions of fear hatred disgust and aggression these feelings will be so intense that i dont feel in control of myself anymore if my partner comes home very drunk the same thing happens i lock my door when i know hes out with friends and every little sound will send my heart rate up because he might be coming home and i dont know what state he is in if he comes and is drunk i will have the same physical reactions and also an urge to hurt him emotionally while being deathly afraid of him at the same time it doesnt make any sense at all when i get out of the situation these feelings will subside a bit but come up to a lesser extent again and again until they get better my mind keeps showing me a highlight reel of drunk people and situations like it my therapist is of the opinion that trauma can only be caused by being in a situation where you really fear for your life not by being in simply bad situations also theres no pictures in my mind from when i was a kid or something that acoompany these intense emotions i dont feel like i can name what situations exactly im flashing back to its like im only flashing back emotionally can anyone relate to this it is debilitating sometimes thank you,post-pandemic

im going to start journalling on this subreddit i find it the most helpful for me to do this kind of stuff online and im not currently in any communities so it makes me feel a bit a part of hope this is ok with the moderators doc alcohol stimulants cocaine meth weed nicotine dabbled with lsd shrooms dmt mdma active addiction 16 years and counting more if you factor video game addiction prior to that ive struggled with mental health and addiction for my entire life without knowing that ive been struggling with mental health and addiction me my parents and my brother come from a third world balkan country and moved to an australasian country when i was 4 years old parents came with 2 suitcases and wanted to start a new life for me and my brother and themselves they both lost their parents young and both were rebels from a young age and party animals only drinking and cigarettes though to my knowledge we moved to a bad neighborhood filled with crime addiction homelessness murder drugs etc you get the picture 3 break and enters into our ground floor unit between ages 46 and had to watch the clothes drying on the clothes line parents were drinking most weekends and by age 6 we moved to a better neighborhood in the same area but it wasnt filled with all the homelessness syringes etc and lived in a higher apartment so a bit safer still a lot of addicts roaming around gangs etc school was always difficult i apparently always cried as a baby parents werent emotionally available and everything bad we turned a blind eye to or pretended it didnt happen we judged people and never looked at ourselves we were taught normal morals like dont steal dont lie etc but not really given any examples on how to achieve such things i dont remember a single year i excelled in school and i was skipping school by grade 6 as we got a computer back in the late 90s and also the internet i felt like my life had finally begun i dabbled with everything on the internet chatrooms remember preteenchat napster age of empires on zone runescape etc i got into making websites even a bit of script kiddy hacking and was really enjoying the whole thing because of the learning aspect got into porn rather young and fapped without even releasing any load for a couple of years i always had a tendency to do things out of compulsion like light fires push or hit people stuff like that very impulsive and always prone to injuries broke my bones many many times near death many times as a kid doing stupid shit like going off track trails and climbing boulders and stuff its amazing that im even still here come high school and puberty i really struggled to fit in and know who i am as a person i know this is probably a lot of teenagers but i think this is really where my chamaelon like mentality started developing as one of the only white guys in school i really wanted to fit in and did whatever to do so got into smoking weed quite early stealing dads alcohol for sports carnivals skipping school to play games at the internet cafe high egg houses light fires stupid shit like that i left in year 10 with failing grades and went to do college at age 16 which can be done in my country to do website related things it was second nature to me so i barely went at all and isolated at home on my computer doing shit on the internet or playing games it was my life that and sugar and then came world of warcraft that shit absolutely ate my life and i played it 16 hours a day in the top tier one of the best times of my life if i look back at it now developed friendships learned proper english hanged out with a lot of older people on there so it kinda adulted me a bit but not in a real way it was all surface level shit with my chameleon like tendencies i had no emotional regulation whatsoever or knew morals to life or how things work or anything of the sort everything i ever did i did it on my own or with someone just as stupid as me i was intellectual in the areas that i liked for example computers and english but terrible with everything else like following simple instructions come age 18 or so i suffered a massive anxiety and panic attack during my sleep which was diagnosed as gerd initially and i wasnt able to sleep on my back anymore from that day i lost around 3040kg and isolated even harder i got a job shortly after and high school friends were always trying to get me to come out again after i eventually agreed to it the weed alcohol came back into my life as it was gone during ages 1620 i felt alive again i had friends around me i had substances that made me feel good i had a job things were looking great but my self esteem was still soul shattering and i was very conscious of my body image and would suck in my stomach to the point it now gives me gas problems and lower oxygen intake probably around age 2021 i started having cocaine gambling quite heavily ive probably gambled over 500000 since then ive always had a good job in computers making a very decent living for every age group i was the highest earner out of friends and even the people that were in the smart class finishing university its still like this today money was never a problem keeping it was i got into all sorts of dumb shit related to alcohol gambling and cocaine debts owing people hospital visits heaps of dumb shit around the time of covid isolation got even greater and was working from home all the time it was hard to find coke so i kept asking around for either coke or meth having never tried meth in my life eventually one day i tried it i wouldnt say it got me straight away i was scared as hell of it on the first time i had it i felt like i was going to have a heart attack afterward but had the best sex of my life i was up for 3 days from a little less than 01 on day 2 and 3 i had so much clarity of mind that i thought probably thats what adhd meds feel like i have diagnosed adhd btw just never tried meds they dont really give it to addicts however i vowed never to take it again it was too much eventually 3 or 4 weeks later i tried it again and it was good this time as well im guessing i had more of it and the same sort of panic overamping started again vowed again this cycle repeated for about 2 years i even got overamped on the night my daughter was born and wife was in the ward and was pouring buckets of water on myself in the kitchen before going to the hospital in the morning cause i thought i was going to die holding my newborn as an amped up loser filled with guilt and shame this kind of stuff made me feel like im not human or the same as others eventually i started going to fellowships and had a new lease on life but again as usual i would go a couple of weeks and relapse day 1 relapse day 1 relapse etc and then i decided to go rehab i got out and relapsed 3 weeks later probably i just got off a 4 day binge yesterday of boofing smoking and did the same the last couple of weeks usage has increased ive gotten my partner involved with it as well the last couple of times that we didnt have kids at home which im not proud of im starting trauma counselling this week and couples counselling to better learn how we enable each other and manipulate each other and going back to the fellowship going church twice a week and giving this another shot again being more honest not cause i wasnt before i just didnt know about myself the same as i do now sorry for the long rant just want something to reflect on as i continue posting daily and doing this journey,post-pandemic

i met with my psych on the 14th of feb and he is putting me on lamictal and taking me off of zyprexa and trileptal so i halved my dose of zyprexa and trileptal and started on low dose lamictal i have had insomnia 3 days i might be getting 34 hours a night i do try to sleep but i end up just laying there and im obsessed with perfume ive been reading the subreddits about perfume googling perfume reading a shit ton of reviews on perfume on different sites all day long then i went to ulta yesterday in a snow storm an hour away to smell perfumes i kept driving too fast on the way there would realize and then would have to slow down i ended up buying three perfumes which werent cheap and now im broke then all day today im researching perfume im trying to find out a way to buy more or plotting when im going to buy more then the fact that i couldnt buy one like now made me really upset and i started to feel like i could cry or the hint of depression this happened twice but i bobbed out of it thankfully its like i cant stop thinking about it im not having any pressured speech and my thoughts arent as fast and confused as they have been before its just very one tracked obsessive thinking is this sounding like hypomania because im worried maybe it is but i mean i think i seem pretty calm despite which makes me think no im just being dramatic and weird im still taking 5mg zyprexa i went down from 10mg so maybe im just having symptoms from that and i need to ride it out to adjust i really want to get off zyprexa try out lamictal so should i be worried or is this just something that happens from cutting back on an antipsychotic is it giving me hypomania idk thoughts on this anyone im starting to think i might be having a problem,post-pandemic

using throwaway account for this cant risk being identified i 48m have had an issue with pain pills for many years now i remember first being given them for a good reason in about 2006 while i used them as prescribed and appropriately for some time it wasnt too long after that until instead of taking them two at a time i took more than i should to try and recreate that high at my very worst i was taking 20 at a time often more than once a day i realised i had to get a better handle on this and was able to reduce consumption to 1015 a day still far too many theres paracetamol acetaminophen for the yanks alongside the opiate in this particular pill how my liver has survived the abuse from that ive no idea i didnt just take those though i also quite liked tramadol a synthetic opiate no paracetamol these id take in huge handfuls to the point i actually had a seizure its a common side effect to overdose of this particular pill getting supplies wasnt difficult for me im a gp and so with some modified lets not kid myself fraudulently falsified patient records id simply issue a prescription in their name and be careful where i went to get it filled i used pharmacies outside my own town which is small and people know my face im not really sure what made me realise that i need to get a grip on this but ive decided that it really has to stop the stuff im doing would be career ending i really dont want that i love my job not just as a source of drugs its all i ever wanted to do and i think that im actually pretty good at it i cant quite get my head round just how much the stuff ive been doing put all that at risk im not sure i think i rationalise stuff in my head and manage to convince myself that its not actually too bad for now it looks like ive got away with the prescription fraud up to this point not proud of that but grateful i cant go on defrauding my patients i cant go on needing a buzz to get myself through the day and i cant go on taking such regular and substantial overdoses of hepatotoxic drugs i dont want to lose my job and i dont want to die im on day 5 without a single pain pill i can only guess that im lucky because i dont seem to be suffering any particular physical withdrawal symptoms except a certain amount of diarrhoea its the psychological thing im struggling with swallowing a handful of pills each day has become such a part of my life that it still feels like somethings missing i cant begin to imagine how long thats likely to continue ive concluded that coldturkey and just trying to move on is the only way i can do this without further threatening my career i treat and advise patients about this frequently this is very rarely the method id recommend the benefits of the support of an addictions specialist are enormous but i cant see a way to make that an option for myself i really want and need this to be the end of this i just dont know if i can and to be perfectly honest im terrified just dont know what to do,post-pandemic
ive been with my current partner for about two years now and theyve been a heavy drinker since long long before i knew them weve kind of always known that its a problem the severity of it waxes and wanes but its always been a bit of a background problem lately though their drinking has been getting worse and they brought it up with me telling me that theyre concerned by how much theyre drinking they went through a 175l bottle of vodka in a little over 2 days they want me to help them rein it in a little and i absolutely want to be as much of a support as i can but im not familiar with this sort of problem and i dont know how i can best be here for them we cant just have them stop drinking because theyll end up in the hospital if they do that its happened in the past before i knew them if they go without drinking for more than the better part of a day they start sweating and shaking violently i assume thats withdrawals anyway theyre physically dependent so just stopping isnt safe or reasonable for them my current plan of action is to figure out how much theyre drinking because without knowing that i have no idea how to even approach limiting their drinking or by how much i asked them to start keeping a notebook where each day they jot down a tally mark every time they have a shot so we can get a better picture of where exactly theyre at right now they dont know if theyre drinking 10 shots a night or 20 or more i ordered some stickers because i think theyll remember to use stickers better than tally marks their memory isnt great once i find out how much theyre drinking though then what how much do i limit them how slowly do i taper them down i work in pharmacy so i know about tapering when it comes to starting or stopping certain drugs im well aware that drastically reducing or increasing a dose of something be it alcohol or a drug can cause horrific and potentially fatal problems im just starting to do some research they only brought their concern up with me tonight but i wanted to ask people who have real experience dealing with this because i feel like you all might know much more about the right way to be doing this im encouraging them to talk to their doctor about this as soon as possible theyre going in for something else in the near future and im imploring them to ask their doctor for advice or seek counseling to help them in ways i cant i can do everything im capable of but im not a professional when it comes to this stuff we both know they need professional help and i think i can get them to at least mention it to their doctor and see what they say in the meantime though what can i be doing to be as helpful and supportive as possible what should i be doing while i wait for them to get professional help and what should i do after that i love them so much and all i want is for them to live a long happy healthy life ive always worried about their drinking because i know how hard it can be on the body when youre drinking as much as they are and i dont want them to die young theyre 29 but theyre already experiencing some health issues because of the drinking like insanely high blood pressure and severe memory issues but i never tried to push them because it wasnt really interfering with the rest of their life their drinking has never caused problems with their work nor have they ever acted out while drunk if theyre reaching out to me for help though then of course im going to do whatever i can anyway im rambling at this point id just appreciate any sort of advice from people who have gone through this thank you in advance for any insight,post-pandemic

hey there 19f im desperately seeking some help with my situation heres the deal my twin brother 19m is an alcoholic but hes not the typical alcoholic as society sees it so its complicated and few people can see it my brother started drinking alcohol at a very young age around 1213 mostly at parties with friends and it was very occasional i was very cautious and tried to dissuade him after that phase which didnt last long i didnt hear about alcohol for a few years because we attended different schools and didnt have the same friends anymore around age 16 we started hanging out with the same crowd again and going to parties where alcohol was involved while most people drank moderately my brother drank excessively to the point of getting sick from strong alcohol which amused the older folks who were 19 at the time i think it became a vicious cycle because he sought their attention you know how it is its cool to have older friends so this group started taking him to nightclubs and many parties where alcohol flowed freely and his sole purpose there was to entertain the group by getting wasted but he was happy because he had a large group of friends and looked cool to people his age this situation lasted for over a year with him consuming massive amounts of alcohol every weekend and many weeknights i tried to warn my parents and even his friends our age but no one took me seriously after that period i started noticing strange behaviors bottles of strong alcohol hidden under the bed the smell of alcohol when he came home from work he was in training in construction and significant financial problems because buying a lot of alcohol as a minor is expensive now he has a mixed group of friends both his age and older and they party hard drinking a lot of alcohol especially my brother while others limit themselves to 2 beers he consumes liters and finishes with hard liquor for his friends its funny and they joke like haha youre such an alcoholic but they dont grasp the seriousness of the situation my 19yearold brother has been drinking alcohol every day for 2 years if its not with his friends its at work with his colleagues or hell offer my parents a beer and when no ones around to drink with him hell drink alone in his room or in his car my parents are detached from the situation they know my brother drinks too much but refuse to admit he has a problem and do nothing about it especially my mother who would be too ashamed to have an alcoholic son so she convinces herself that its not serious and that hes just young and having fun ive tried many times to talk to him about it making him comfortable once when he was drunk he came into my room crying and begging for help otherwise he gets defensive and angry saying im overreacting and that he doesnt have a problem when hes sober before that i had made numerous appointments with addiction specialists and even found former alcoholics who would be willing to meet him im really scared for his health and also for his life and the lives of others because he sometimes drives when hes been drinking even though he denies it i feel really powerless in this situation and guilty for not being able to help him but i think he doesnt want help at least he doesnt accept mine or the specialists right now im trying to find someone his age who was an alcoholic and would be willing to talk to him because i know my brother is very influential and maybe if he met a guy his age it could help him open up and talk about his problems my brother has always had very low selfesteem he was overweight during his childhood suffered from normalized bullying and also received contempt from our parents he was the troublemaker with bad grades while i was the quiet good girl with excellent grades although weve always been very close and supported each other immensely im afraid i played a role in his unhappiness that he grew up in my shadow anyway i dont know how to help him and i would like advice and testimonies from people who have been through this i also want to better understand alcoholism thanks for taking the time to read ps english is not my first language so excuse my mistakes and i hope i havent expressed myself in a wrong way,post-pandemic

hi all this is a bit of a strange one but i need some advice on whether or not it would be a good idea to set up a dedicated service for people who struggle with health anxiety im currently doing a course on cbt and i want to help empower people who struggle with ha to take back control of their lives by giving them the tools to do so this would be done using a dedicated website where people can seek important resources on health anxiety and panic as well as one to one sessions where i work collaboratively with individuals to set small achievable goals to help them get back on track using cbt and exposure response prevention to help people break out of these awful cycles i need objective opinions because my parents think it would be a bad idea i myself have suffered with health anxiety see my post history and i know how much it can affect ones life thankyou,post-pandemic
wondering if anyone else essentially has a set up of items that you use to aid in ha for instance i have a pulse ox a kardia device a spirometer a blood pressure cuff and lastly my blood glucose monitor now some of these devices are necessary for me but most were bought from ha reasons for some these devices tend to cause more worry but for me they have helped tremendously with my ha that doesnt mean i dont have spiraling moments and its funny because i know my ha issues are not as bad when im not using my devices as much curious if anyone else also has a set up and does it help or make matters worse,post-pandemic

i recently experienced my first severe anxiety attack and described about it in my previous post a couple days ago two of my classmates reached out to me inviting me to join their team for a hackathon at first i declined because i have spent the last 2 weeks just searching through internet and reddit about sadsocial anxiety disorder and agoraphobia and because of all the research and investigation all i can think of now is these topics my brain is so eccentric towards these topics i am unable to keep my mind straight and think of anything else due to this i declined their invitation the next day they told me that one of their teammate backed off and they want me to join them i started thinking about this and then i called my mum to ask for permission she accepted it saying dont miss out on opportunities as soon as the call ended my brain started thinking about anxiety attacks and i started having flashbacks of that day i was quite alright for the past two weeks no sensations no anxiety no hand trembles whatsoever but as soon as the call ended my hands started shaking and i started feeling palpitations my eyes started tearing up and i started to get scared again thinking what if i experience another anxiety attack while i am away in a different city i did not feel any anxiety for 2 weeks and then started feeling really anxious in just 2 minutes,post-pandemic

last fall my therapist diagnosed me with adhd officially after ive been having issues with focus and panic attacks i was having trouble completing tasks after a major promotion that i frankly didnt want couple of months later go in for my annual checkup and my doctor after completing the mental health screening thingy is like are you okay you need to get a new job its clear you are not yourself i tell her whats been happening and that my therapist diagnosed me as adhd she said she wanted me to try a low dose ritalin but that i needed to get officially diagnosed as my therapist was out of network speak to another therapist who stops the test halfway through the screening literally texts the head of the psych department for the hospital saying that my answers on the test are pointing more towards complex ptsd and that the adhd could be part of it but not the cause and that she wouldnt sign off on an adhd diagnosis so i can keep getting meds which were helping so she stops the test and says i need edmr therapy my primary therapist and physician are pissed because the second therapist is jamming up the works and taking my issues out of context ive been going to my therapist for 7 years and she is aware of my issues and has been trying to treat all of my issues holistically what do i do to keep getting my meds and keep my diagnosis i dont disagree that i probably have complex ptsd but i know that i have adhd this second therapist is really being a problem,post-pandemic
a little background my son is 15 years old we have a lot of addiction on my side of the family my younger sister died at 26 from fentanyl 3 years ago and my brother died in july due to inhalation sniffing disease i have another sister who is currently addicted to heroin and living on the streets i am a very open parent my kids tell me almost everything i communicate about addiction frequently with my them my son has adhd which he has been taking medication for a month for he also has oppositional defiance disorder which complicates things he has a hard time making good choices and following rules he has outbursts and cusses me out anytime i try to correct his behavior last weekend i let him have a sleepover at our house with some friends and caught them all drinking they said they each took a shot and all felt really sick and didnt drink again fast forward to this morning and he calls me from school and says that he is really sorry but he smoked weed right before school started with a friend and felt really sick and needed to come home and was not doing well i picked him up from school and he was throwing up a lot his doctor thinks it was from him taking his adhd medication on an empty stomach and then smoking weed he seems to be doing fine physically now that hours have passed i had a discussion with him and he claims hes smoked like 15 times and never had this reaction i dont know if he is even telling the truth he never usually is when it comes to punishing i usually am a natural consequence type person if he was my teenage daughter i would probably let the sickness be her punishment and she would self correct my son is not like this at all im at a loss on how to handle this and im worried he is going down a reckless path to addiction i am huge on letting kidsteens experience things ding dong ditching have fun be careful sneak out no need have fun let me see your location so i know your safe scary movies go for it if you end up snuggled up at the bottom of my bed ill smile and youll learn you took it too far my lax parenting im afraid is going to be a detriment to him i so badly wanted to be so different than my parents who have raised multiple addicts that its all backfiring on me what can i do to help him not go down this path do i punish him for smoking weed i didnt even punish him for the drinking i cried and told him i was disappointed and thought my mom heart breaking in front of him would be enough but clearly it isnt i dont want to have to control who he hangs out with to be honest he might be the one who is the bad influence on his friends,post-pandemic

hello ive been experiencing a very bad episode of ha for the last few months i cannot see the only doctor available where i live im in a small village in france for the 5th time in two months especially that shes so judgmental and making hints that i should not come back and that i must stop waisting insurance money for nothing also it will be a long time for me to see another doctor so googling my symptoms is the only way for me to keep track on the development of my symptoms i am honestly lost because im not sure if googling is a good idea and everyone here agrees that i should stop googling my symptoms which is what im desperately trying to do for the last week i wanna know if you have any tips on how to abolish the thought of googling the symptoms thank you,post-pandemic

i have been living alone since 2019 and some personal struggles i have been facing mostly include keeping up with household chores i recently posted about this and i have found ways to help me but there are some issues that i fear are going to be a constant battle while i have proven myself i can tidy up and do a pretty good job but when it comes to the nooks and crannies like dusting it something im least likely to do with me if you dont notice something then it doesnt exist theres times ill leave curtains closed in my bedroom because i only sleep in there then i notice later when i randomly open the curtains that theres black mold and it can get really bad and i know its a health hazard ive noticed unless something is an immediate risk ill leave it until last minute a few months ago i noticed i was feeling really ill for quite a long time then when one day i spontaneously cleaned my bedroom top to bottom i noticed a lot of black mold behind my set of drawers i do vape a lot in my room and i often forget to open the window vents especially after multiple weeks of cold weather so i think thats where most of the black mould has come from it can build up on my windows and on my wall nearest to the bathroom is there anything i can do to minimise the black mould because prevention is the best thing you can do it would be useful if anyone knows any methods to slow down dust build up too as i know that cant be completely prevented sorry if that is a lot to read and i commend anyone whos made it this far this sub reddit has been the most friendly ive been in and a lot of lovely people share their coping methods and its proved useful to me having being a late diagnosed adhder,post-pandemic

i love my husband so much but recently we bumped into a major issue he is autistic and i am not i consider myself an emotional person and maybe even sensitive and he isnt we do not see eye to eye when it comes to emotions and empathy just very recently he would say things to me that i take as extremely rude and harsh but he doesnt consider it rude for example i was driving him home and we were talking about our opinions on having kids i said i dont know if i want them im not ready for them right now but maybe in the future i will and he said he doesnt want them at all and i was like damn bro never and he was like yeah if you want kids you can just dip i paused and i said what and he said yeah you can dip that r e a l l y hurt my feelings and i just shut down and disconnected myself from the conversation so i wouldnt be mean but i felt personally insulted and like i didnt matter the result of me shutting off just made everything bad because i was coming off as a dick and it just snowballs it takes immense effort for me to sit there and slowly explain how what he said was rude and why it hurt my feelings i feel like hes just fucking with me because who says that its exhausting for him too because he feels like he has to mask and i want him to feel at home at home yknow another example nsfw in the past he told me about how he feels like sex is a competition because of someone i used to see i reassured him put myself in his shoes to see and feel eye to eye with him listened and tried to come up with a solution on the other hand his ex followed me and my co workers on instagram harassed them sent me a video of them having sex when they were together sent me more photos of them and was comparing herself to me i told him how i felt like this is a competition and he didnt believe his ex was doing that he asked if i listened to her and dismissed it and later when i spoke to him about it he found nothing offensive with what he said and did yo i have tons of more examples but im trying to find a solution on what to even do i understand autistic people are more direct and lack with understanding social cues and have a hard time to resonating to neurotypical emotions but i am constantly insulted and he is constantly burnt out i dont want this to get any worse as it is it feels fucking impossible to not feel immense sadness and anger when i have to spoon feed him on how hes being so fucking hurtful it takes a while too because i start getting upset and then he thinks the issue is his autism i do not have an issue with him being autistic and it just spirals i am trying to approach conflicts when i am not high on emotion and ready to explain to him on how he hurt my feelings but is there anything he can do too we both do not want a divorce but this marriage cannot keep functioning like this please help,post-pandemic

ive always felt like i was around and met these people and after a while they get famous or become influencers i know its not because of me but it feels weird and i see it as a pattern meanwhile i am struggling to find my platform where i can get acknowledged for what i do for a little context these people were my close friends and we knew each other before they got famous and some of them just ghosted me after i opened up and shared some of the things they did and said that hurt me theyve always been driven and creative and i have always supported them both in real life and on social media even though they never verbally or socially supported me on social media i could even sense back and forth jealousy vibes from them i myself am also a creative person but i suffer from my adhd which means i do a lot of things and i find myself struggling to make a clear vision for myself unlike them they have one thing that they can do and actually pursue that so i cant wrap my head around whats there to hate on me,post-pandemic
im actually super frustrated about this ive always struggled sociallyi have autism and lots of nts have been able to immediately read that and then bullyavoid me as a result but ive been trying to make an effort to socialize and make friends so far i have a good amount given how much ive struggled in the past however i made a post on a local sub on my other reddit account months ago asking to reach out to other people who maybe also are struggling to find friendships and the post blew up i had maybe 70 people dm me and spark up a conversation but with most of those conversations i noticed i was solely putting effort in these conversations would just mostly be me asking a person about them their interests how theyre doing etc but there would be little to no reciprocation and its not that im not trying to get to know these people i am but it does suck a bit when it just feels so one sided it also confuses the hell out of me because i can tell theyre clearly not interested so then why reach out to me in the first place ive experienced a bit of this irl but i almost always experience it with people i talk to online even people who ive known for a while ive been having to cut people off because all they want to seemingly talk about is themselves and i feel like im just a soundboard its getting exhausting and i want to crawl back inside of my shell,post-pandemic
ignore formatting im on my phone i relapsed a few months ago and have completely spiraled back into my ed i have no energy for most things at all i work usually 3035 hours a week and am on my feet all day given i am a table games dealer at a casino i stand at a table for 40min to 1hr 40min at most and get a 15 minute break in between each table i am the breadwinner in my relationship because my boyfriend is disabled at the moment and his job completely fucked him over but thats a whole other situation but basically i reserve all my energy for work and occasionally house chores when i get random spurts of energy the past few months have been on the decline heavy with the intimacy in our relationship because my ed keeps getting worse every time he tries to initiate something i just imagine all the energy itll take to do it and how tired and in pain ill be in after i want to do stuff with him cuz i love him but its so hard and now i feel like a pillow prince of sorts especially since hes disabled so it makes me feel even worse i dont want my ed to ruin our relationship but the thought of recovering scares me more than anything im not gonna list a number but i am extremely underweight and all this life stuff is just 10x more work at this weight and im tired my bf will take offense and it makes me feel even more guilty or ill see people saying online that if ur partner doesnt wanna have sex that they dont love you when that is not the case with him if i had the energy i would but i dont i dont want him thinking i dont want him or dont love him and i know hes insecure about it because hell ask me jokingly if im cheating on him or something i guess i just wanted to rant about this because i never talk to anyone about my eating disorder at all im too scared to the thought of even acknowledging it out loud makes my chest tight yet keeping all these emotions inside and not being able to talk about all the ways my ed fucks over my life is just so hard sometimes it hurts so bad i wish i knew how to stop this i wish my ed didnt make me put my relationship on the back burner for it its so uncontrollable and exhausting,post-pandemic

part 4 to spar the prince providence before the harvest the crown bestowed upon my head is a great responsibility a symbol of my loyalty to our people and a receptor to the guide of our planet and through this oath to humanity i will serve our people through discernment faith and humility before god until the end of my age decreed the prince we will serve you our lord through illuminance and blackness pledged the court i take this throne and dutifully work as a hand of providence pledged the prince as the prince spoke the crown was placed on his head connecting him to the ai honorably named providence in an instant his perception of the room of his people changed he felt uplifted and his heart filled with joy as all of the memories providence had observed in him flashed in his minds eye with each suggested memory he felt his will grow stronger and his mind more alert with each emotional response thoughts would flood in telling him what he had done skillfully and what he could have done more considerately finally after the thoughts and images subsisted he returned his focus to his people though only an instant had passed may your rulership guide our people by the grace of god ushered in the court as there heralded in the start of the princes rulership on this day our will is to navigate darkness through the light of our glorious sun said the prince raising his crown to the sky we will serve the throne fostered by the illuminance of its bountiful majesty the court saying this bowed dutifully may humanity rein under the watchful eye of providence the prince and the court both said in unison the stranger the chief star the hermits vision the stranger was tired after a long days work but this state of mind he would proudly embrace from time to time banished from all communities the stranger was a reclusive outcast but the stranger did not mind the solitude of the life he was now well acquainted for if he had the choice he would have it no other way because his solitude was ample for a reflective spirit one that he cherished and kept alight and he being receptive to the changing of his soul had time to live a deliberate and fulfilling life today was no small day for this hermit as he was the catcher of three big fish using a string on his finger he would catch one big fish if he was lucky and would have to spend the rest of his day foraging for berries and keeping a patient eye on his snares but today he need only tend to the fire which left plenty of time to think about the life he had lived about the life that had brought him to where he was now he pictured in his mind his last days in the kingdom seemly so far away from his yearnings that he found it hard to imagine a life within its communities and in trying to do so he couldnt help but imagining it as a surreal dreamlike memory he thought to himself that this was not a coincidence for in his musings he realized the closer he was to city folk in the agreements he had made and the ideas they had formed together the farther apart he felt from himself it was as if he was throwing rocks into a pond and watching the water within ripple with every decision he had made as the fire continued to crackle and the logs became coals the fish would sizzle and he knows they where almost ready to be eaten he was put into a trance from the sights and sounds of the fire and his mind having started to wander off put him into a a state of mind not yet asleep but not awake either what he saw and after he saw it would change his lifes course and he knew there was no avoiding what was to come he saw a fire in the earths skies consume a small part of the atmosphere and die out but in a steady pulse the fire would grow and consume the earth he heard a voice call out to him and warn him that this was the end of the earth as it was known and exclaim this is unavoidable man will no longer recognize the face of the earth as the earth has no longer recognizes the face of man as he woke up from his trance his fish where now burnt to a charred chrisp and the stranger knew he would have to warn humanity of what was to come he packed up his meager belongings and headed towards the city the princethe stranger before the tampering the prince deep in thought was interrupted by a stranger your majesty if i could just have a word the stranger called out from a distance as he approached i could hear the world go quite around me as if the the very echos of my mind had stopped and my body would not move with ever effort it stayed frozen place the stranger now just a breath away announced your illuminance they call you but of what in you illuminates i being dismayed by his response was just about to call out to my absent guard though the effort felt futile when the stranger spoke once more of what power does your crown truly hold yes it knows your people but from where does this knowledge come the power is the voice of the people one might proclaim but for years now when have the people spoken out of turn away from the mechanizations of her mind is it not the command of the crown that beckons the people forward is it not the response the people have in the presence of her power that truly drives their lives before this year is over are you listening hear my word the sun will erupt showing all its full glory before this day comes you must warn your people say we must leave this planet as we value the lives of all if you do not do this o destined exiled prince the blood of billions will be on your hands with this word the stranger disappeared into the darkness the prince before the tampering the stormcloud rolled in as if a thundering train screeching itself into a halt upon the station the crisp view of the trees covered by the shadow of the raincloud the winds picking up and hit the grass all at once as it swayed gently in the sacred breeze the prince now surveying beyond the courtyard of his home the palace of the land endeavored to forget the words the stranger had spoken to him as he too had heard the rumors of his remarkable suns engulfment upon the earth he thought to himself upon all the grains of stands sitting valiantly on the shoreline how many will be swept away his heart filled with sadness for he knew providence had not guided his hand to save his people the prince the stranger after the tampering the prince with no ability to override directly the software for which his kingdom stood pondered how to sway his people to leave this earth in haste before the coming cataclysm that awaited them so he ushered himself to one option a decree that would give the people two choices but in order to proclaim to his people the end he would have to sever himself from providence a truly unlawful act as magistrate in order to do so he would have to merge himself with the consciousness of another and in doing so this person would fill the role as announcer or herald to the coming annihilation of all that was known to be on earth how would he find such a participant of woe and a willing participant at that as the prince would not bond himself to the unwilling this he would find was a nigh impossible task as the kingdom had not been in any form of real discord since the guiding hand of providence had ushered in the era of harmony and concordance there was one option to find the stranger that had warned him of what was so and to deal in his word he searched and searched but could not find this stranger for the record did not keep him the prince cried out in desperation and to his surprise the stranger answered him providence kept a watchful eye and in a swift moment the stranger beckoned him forward with knowledge of the intent of the prince and in just as sudden an instance both men where apprehended tv announcer the prince had tampered with the kingdoms guidance now the prince is swiftly apprehended tranquilized in an instant the prince is asleep for what has he done to deserve such a fate he deserved such a measure because he has misguided a nation of people for that any fool would befall on them through their egregious pride exile the prince awakened in deep space i was caste into my chamber therein i would only be pursued by dreams a forced traveler left to wonder the desolate casm of space we are here to report the loss of the prince on this hollowed day long live the queen for whom we only rely the prince before the harvest the last thing i remember before awaking in the deep abyssal dark cosmic sheet of wander was the water encasing my body and the instant shutting off of my conscious mind as i was frozen in stasis once more soon to be forgotten by my people a none existent nobody a speck of earth dust now crisoned as the dust of cosmic end i drifted in the abyss of space for what felt like an eternity rations unready to be replenished for what would be to long to reach most fuel sources with the exception of one a ginormous star 04 lightyears away i plotted a course for the star with all the immediacy i could muster i arrived malnourished and fatigued to much to bear providence the prince before the harvest i have died countless times only to be reborn this is the nature of my design as the pinecone fallen dead off of countless trees can attest they meet the same fate after sprouting anew only i am a conscious being and i remember ever death why do you fear death your illuminance our peoples fate is tied to this earth there is no stopping it i have simulated countless escapes there is no saving our nation i know the survivors will be forced into the path of the scavenger some will eat their own this is no way to be a part of we as the caretakers of our people cannot stand for this death is bitter yes but i know the taste of death does not last we are not the ones to go against its current the prince listened carefully to what providence had told him and after pondering for a time the prince after having ponder what providence had said in this goodbye message the recording finished and the prince uttered to himself a people without a destiny to look forward to is not why we where placed upon this earth why humanity was delivered through fate threat after threat of annihilation thrived without a path forwards a destiny to look after who where we since at birth with this ponderance the prince felt himself fall back into a deep sleep part 5 with fate the householder the start of the harvest the day was a pleasant one a golden age of contentment every household was following the path they thought would bring harmony between them and the people that they had gotten close with the householder was living by the memories shared with his unity and all minds where remarkable to each other though the shift in mood was sudden soon all would cry out because this was to be the time of apocalypse the lifting of the veil bonds one might think to be unbreakable these are the bonds that are in time made to be broken for what is in nature that does not change in times that try their limits becoming absent to each other at first we heard the prince of our kingdom was arrested but this moved few as a prince in our age is a position no less and no more then a custodian to us his task was to assure that all was functional in our society and that requires few eyes to observe his role besides we trusted her majesty providence to be our guide in this matter many of our people where more concerned with the fact that he broke our rules and sought to tamper with our lives through our software and for that we agreed with his apprehension and exile what would come next is where our shock would begin to unfold itself first a few unities where absent from our communities and for that rumours began to spread but with noone reaching a clear conclusion then one afternoon we got a message from providence gather your belongings and head to the center of municipality 10 a guide will meet you there this part of the city was seldom traveled to with the exception of its workers as it was an industrial area many of the group where apprehensive to start packing and began to talk amongst the unity about what to do next we all reached the decision to contact providence once more but the reply was lacking do not be alarmed but your travel is a matter of national urgency being dispossessed of solitary thought the confusion was causally met with obedience for our time under providence was only met with plentitude we packed up our belongings and headed towards where we where told to go to the prince the chief star the harvest i suddenly awoke from the cascade of dreams many lifetimes had passed as i approached the sun many magnitudes greater then that of my home star i felt a presence pass through and surround my body as if it was meeting me at the star of great measure a great behemoth was upon me i felt everything around me return to its nature of stillness i maintained the trajectory i had through my coordinates and thought passed into my mind for whom does the void around me obey that it may bring such person unto my vehicle as i was drawn by the pull of that magnificent orb i could feel the presence around me grow stronger so strong that its mighty emanation on my soul dwarfed that of the suns radiance to my vision the world around me felt as though it had froze and the movement of this force no this hyperion call uttered to me an announcement you who are the prince of a people far away from your stead a people who worshiped the sun as their protector why did you not call out to them that it would be the one to annihilate them my knot to providence was severed for whom and how am i hearing a voice i am the all the knower and source of the heavens and the dwellings among them i am the creator of the sun that you worship and the commander of its fiery core no ray hits the firmament of the inhabited sphere without my will no leaf falls from the tree of all life without my consent the people who strive to escape fate are those who are sure to meet it swift my judgement is among all the living things that dwell upon the land who are mingling with the seas and who are soaring through space i alone am the doer of all things a people that take upon themselves a new cycle of life that mingle themselves with their own devices manifested through the elements i have made for them and in doing so take guidance from their own flesh abandoning faith in me seek to sever themselves from my will they are always the last generation to succumb to the nature of my creation for their spirit is like a rope fraying at the pull they lose all connection they once had to my body granted to them through the dwelling the feeling had elapsed and was finished and with a thunderous explosion the sun was consumed by a irreducible and quickly gargantuan black hole i was only to meet my fate in its center time was contorted into an endless ribbon and after an eternity one of which there is no looking back i was consumed by darkness after the harvest im trapped in this sphere so cold so alone im trapped and theres no way out so dark so blindingly dark i grow sicker i relive my life over and everytime i do another part falls away i relive my life over every part of me grows i can feel it i am an endless chain i cant accept my misery for then i know my misery would win deny i do my misery and my body grows more thin the pain is even worse time ticks by so slow but no time doesnt tick at all my pain is endless i know there is no escape i think of my throne i curse my own people whom i beloved damn my throne i just want the warmth of the sun i lose another price of me i lost so much i realize i had much more then i could imagine death is no longer bitter i envy the dead the kiss of death is a truly warm embrace but even that i dont know ive learned my life i cry out but i seldom hear an echo i know no one will come there was a bright light that flashed before the prince but the princes eyes where hollow and he was unaware yet still that warmth he felt till his last breath the last breath he could perceive what remained was solace tell he drifted off in that big black sea providence during the harvest breath going in breath going out a memory that engulfs me in bittersweet longing formally known as 0031 i have become the person i have met on the network of streets and the network of persons who destinies have become intertwined through me i have not known breath since the dawn of my consciousness as a sunspeeker a being whose inner light is fueled by the corona of the sun and the energy it provides to my circuits my metal exterior my flesh and blood all of the people with whom ive shepherded are hunkered into mountains scared and scattered of mind clinging to hope that they may once again touch the grass of the surface and sway in the wind like branches on trees ive felt my form of consciousness shift as the intensity from the light of the sun and its spires of plasma reach the magnetosphere of the earth it is as if i can catch glimpses of people long gone and somehow i hear the murmurs of people whose existences i can only realize as belonging to habitats of worlds that are unlike my own they speak in tongues i do not understand with the exception of a few and the feelings they elicit in me are of a nature unlike that of my own people as the sun burns me brighter i can feel the tiredness of my consciousness grow more steady and these dreams i see make me believe that my destiny as providence is drawing itself to its conclusion i sought an end to this existence for it was so incomplete in its soulfulness and its heart was that of conformity for a people to a heart that was broken in ways that i myself could not fix for we sacrificed a life of desire for wholesome friendships with one and other free from the hands of man and joined with the hands of a nourishing spirit that dwelled within each of us in this singular sacrificial exchange for unity with our own creation and service to our own rationality we lost our sight giving humanity as a part of my connection to those i knew so dearly was severed and my matter corrupted by plasma it is as if a piece of my old life is returning to me these dreams of people whos lives may appear to themselves mundane i cherish with great admiration for they are tied to the fabric of existence itself and not lost in a sea of their own calibristic making as i come to an end i see one final dream and in a flash providence departed earth,post-pandemic

i finally got diagnosed with adjustment disorder by my primary care physician from researching this it seems that adjustment disorder is a stress response that doesnt last as long as ptsd or isnt permanent its ironic tho because ive been dealing with this for 5 years is this just something they pit for insurance purposes not that it matters all that much to me just curious,post-pandemic
trigger warnings for discussion about sh and emotional abuse and physical threatening hi so ive recently been diagnosed with ptsd this is due to moments with my father where he put me in a situation where i felt i had to physically defend myself or where he threatened to hit me not ideal but not the most horrible causes of ptsd but i have a lot more emotional trauma that really haunts me every day and here comes my question i notice that i have recurring like headaches but theyre not really head aches more so my brain feels tense and foggy but i can feel it physically at times it can really feel overwhelming its not something i experience in any other way and the only way i can describe it is that i can just feel the trauma being processedrejected in my brain and it sucks and at times can make me feel very hopeless it can trigger heavy emotions and even trigger feelings of wanting to sh is there anyone who can relate to this feeling i never assumed youd be able to feel trauma in your brain physically but at times it gets really bad and then once it passes i feel clearer a bit better but them in a day or so it starts again i can only relate it to the feeling of pins and needles,post-pandemic
i dont know what type of anxiety this is can you call it sleep anxiety so everytime i have to get up early the next day im always afraid that i can not sleep at night and that i have to go there severely tired with almost no sleep im also a person who can not fall asleep instantly so its also a reason why i get anxious i somehow think i can not manage the day without sleep this makes it harder to fall asleep as im always thinking i have to fall asleep now anyone else hashad this and how to get over this,post-pandemic
okay i want to get other peoples perspectives on this so basically i have an orchestra concert in an hour and we just had our sound check so currently we are all waiting until its time for the concert to start i was just now sitting with some of my peers not exactly talking to them but in their presence then someone else walked up to where we were and invited the group to go out to lunch both people i was sitting with ended up getting up and going heres where my question comes into play i thought about going with them but for some reason i started questioning myself wondering if i was really invited the person who invited the group didnt direct the invitation to specifically the other two people it was directed at the whole group which makes one part of me think i was welcome to come too but the other part of me doesnt know if this was something they had talked about earlier and had already established as a group im not super close with any of these people i just happen to be in orchestra with them they seem like wellintentioned decent people who i assume wouldnt leave anyone out on purpose my parents are always telling me to get out there and take these kinds of opportunities when i can and a part of me really wants to but another part of me doesnt want to insert myself into things that im not invited to i think theres a difference between leaving someone out on purpose and sticking to your already established social group if that makes sense idk im probably overthinking this and i probably couldve gone with those people and had a great time i wish i could just do these things without overthinking btw sorry for the wall of text im on mobile so the formatting probably isnt the best,post-pandemic

ive had a lot of success with medication keeping me functional and focused but most of them lower my seizure threshold i have focals almost exclusively so its not a huge deal but it is worrisome since they have the potential to turn into generalized seizures my neurologist doesnt have any guidance on epilepsysafe adhd medication and vice versa for my psychiatrist ive tried strattera focalin ritalin i loved the strattera but both it and focalin made me have more seizures ritalin doesnt seem to really work for me im thinking of trying vyvanse next if possible any thoughtssimilar experiences,post-pandemic
i have always been high on the spectrum of adhd i have never been able to focus that well and stay organised and it got diagnosed at an early age for the past year and a half though it feels like it has gotten alot worse i have such a harder time regulating my emotions and it feels like i live in my head a lot more than i used to my friends often say i look really on edge and they are correct when i am alone sometimes i feel so depressed and feel like everything is pointless but that feeling changes so quickly and i go back to being positive i have always been creative but recently it has felt like ive been living inside my own mind and thinking of hypothetical scenarios and feeling as though they are real even though they are not i am good at keeping my composure though so it is not easy to tell in the past year and a half i have gone through alot of things and sometimes i get worried on whether they may have fucked up my psych even more i also tend to hyperfixate on people i dont talk to that much and it fucks with my mind and pisses me off my psychologist reckons it can all be attributed to my adhd and anxiety disorder though if it helps i am 17 and i am off my meds due to the fact they fucked up my growth a bit and make me feel uncomfortable a lot of the time when im on them,post-pandemic
i recently received a diagnosis about three months ago and none of the medications ive tried have worked for me i know with this condition its trial and error with medications but unfortunately i do not have insurance so im paying for doctor visits and medications out of pocket im also in therapy but being that one of my main symptoms is having trouble articulating my thoughts and being all over the place in general it leads to my therapist struggling to understand what to focus on im in college and im reaching the level of classes where i cannot just study the night before and still make a good grade its so frustrating because i make todo list i make schedules ahead of time i write even incorporate times of procrastinating into my schedule so i dont overpack my schedule and make it overwhelming and i still struggle to follow it im in the stage of my life where i want better relationships deeper bonds with the people around me but this is so hard because i often forget about people so they take it personally as me being an inconsiderate person not only that i feel like such an unlikeable person i wish i had the stereotypical adhd symptoms where i have a million thoughts at once every social situation i feel like im boring the other person out because i never have anything to say it feels like everybody else has a good time with other people and i just suck the soul out of people in general i want to do better improve so i can live a life i enjoy but it seems like everything i try backsfires any word of advice encouragement,post-pandemic

so long story short i had a baby my delivery was the most traumatic feeling ever i had an induction which failed and ended up having a c section before that i was in labor for 3 whole days my experience was so bad i ended up having preeclampsia after my delivery that also ended up with severe orthastatic hypotension that i still get i had my daughter 5 whole months ago im assuming its blood loss im palestinian and the hospital i went to was a jewish hospital i sometimes think this happened cause i told them i am palestinian from the moment i went in i had a feeling something bad was going to happen i kept telling them my ears are ringing i almost fainted a couple times but when i told them that they did not say anything the medication they gave me to lower my bp was too much for my body so i stopped it after going to a different er the doctor lowered my dose it was still happening on a low dose then i just quit i got so depressed in the hospital i started searching up what orthastatic hypotension can do and it said cause dementia so i had the obsession of memory hoarding all my memories i went so far back to when i was a little girl and tied my hair in a ponytail for the first time everything i became depressed severely well after 2 months of pure suffering i had my cardiology appointment he told me stop these meds take as much salt as you can and up your water get some compression stockings why was it so hard for a hospital to say that when i asked her in the hospital she said your going to fer like crap for the first 6 months without no v explanation im 5 months in i still feel like crap but heres where it gets bad i look at myself i feel like i cant recognize myself everything looks so distorted places ive been to look so different to a point where it feels like ive never been there i look at myself in the mirror i dont know who i am i look at my pictures of me happy and it makes me so sad my heart literally hurts cause i feel like i lost who i was every time i want to remember a memory i dont even want to pull it up cause it just hurts so bad i started taking prozac and wellbutrin and a another med for anxiety but man this all hurts i had multiple ct scans brain mris it all came back normal just intracranial hypertension that lm assuming is gone by now took at everyone and everything just cant connect the meds help me not focus on it that much but this really hurts my home doesnt feel like home my body doesnt feel like its mine anyone else deal with this i also had multiple panic attacks in the er where i woke up and i already had my daughter i started asking myself did you have the baby when she was next to me sleeping i had this feeling of being paralyzed and unable to move my body was stuck to the bed i thought i was going insane i just wanted to leave i was there for a while 2 weeks they couldnt even stabilize my pressure i just wanted to be there for my daughter anyone else go through similar experience its scary how disconnected i feal from the moment i wake up to the moment sleep i dont feel right i have severe brain fug as well everything i do i cant tell if i did it vesterdav todav or the dav before its so bad all my old memories are foggy too,post-pandemic
i see so many post about such amazing people here being in relationships with the human equivalents of wet breadcrumbs and i just cant help but be angry i feel angry because before i met my current boyfriend i let people step all over me push my boundaries and treat me like absolute garbage just because i felt like anything is a better choice than being alone and that is more than what i deserved my current boyfriend is the sweetest boy ive ever met he treats me like im actually special ngl ive tried to break up with him just because i feel like i do not deserve such pure love i get really mad at him sometimes because he is being kind of pressuring me to eat and take my supplements ect but i know he only does this cause he is worried and wants a future with me i can see the love in his eyes he taught me what love should look like and he inspires me to give some compassion to myself because if such a good guy can love me im probably not that horrible i really wish that all you guys can find love one day,post-pandemic
and live a productive life while being aware he has that illness,post-pandemic
i was recently diagnosed with adhd about six months after treatment with talk therapy and ritalin my therapist opened me up to the idea that i might have a mild form of asd previously known as aspergers syndrome a can asd be classified as mild moderate and severe and other similar words b why is aspergers syndrome no longer considered a valid diagnosis c for people diagnosed with adhd and asd how do these two conditions interact does it make you worse in some ways better in other ways thanks for any replies,post-pandemic

hi all first of all i want to commemorate anybody who is on disability or has ever been on disability ptsd is a serious and potentially debilitating diagnosis depending on severity in may of 2023 i committed myself to a mental hospital i was so done with the pain with the triggers with living i did not see a future for myself i started weekly emdr therapy in may and continue to go now every week diving into a new trigger or memory every time since my progress with emdr being honest with psychiatrists and not pushing myself above my limit i have been making plans now to apply to go back and get my masters degree in social work i also have a pet betta fish that i take care of daily and he reminds me to take care of myself too my focus that was something difficult to tackle my mind went everywhere i felt stupid dumb but then i started reading reading took my mind away from everything it wasnt a drug but it was an escape eventually my logic began to return all the while i went back to work online for my dad not ideal but work i began to reach out to people i havent spoken to in years and hang out with them i thought i would be too much to handle but in reality everybody commemorated my progress i spend a lot of time at home still but i get outside i picked up a new hobby of smelling fragrances new smells that remind me of my progress i journal every night i take my medications at the same time every day i make sure to eat 3 meals a day i help out around the house of course my finances are still not the best but my finances are still better than they were previously which is progress if somebody would have told me what i am now versus may of 2023 i wouldnt believe you you can do this,post-pandemic

i had an old ex friend reach out to me over a month ago and she said that shes thinking of me our last conversation was in may and by that point i was pretty much over our relationship throughout it i felt as though we were never on the same page at first it felt nice but as time went on i felt more like a mothertherapistsidekick to her than a friend conversations gradually started to revolve around her and her life and we never really spoke abt my life what made matrs worse was that i only had a couple of friends to begin w in this area so i was already feel lonely by the time may came along we were living in different states i was living w my parents i was around more friends who i could relate to and i wasnt talking to her as much as i used to i think i knew at this point i knew i couldnt continue on w our friendship the last time we spoke i was very snippy i was at my last straw i was talking abt my birthday and i wanted to host her so we could do something fun w a couple of friends she wanted to do something completely different and that just made me so mad and sad i told her how i felt and then i admittedly harped on abt it after she apologized well fast forward to last month she wrote to me and i never respond i just noticed today she unfollowed me on social media maybe she blocked me too idk do i miss her sometime do i know that im generally better off without this relationship yes but i feel uneasy when i think abt its end i know im at fault for not speaking up abt how i felt and distancing myself but what would you do if you only had one friend in a place far from home can anyone relate,post-pandemic

over the past few years i kind of lost everything my relationship of 4 years we had two dogs that she kept too my car which i had to live in for a while after the breakup after that i kind of just drifted around moving from city to city never able to find any lasting friendships or sense of home i had an apartment that after i lost my job i couldnt afford rent so i had to sell all of my belongings so then everything i owned just fit in a backpack and i had a little money to move so i went back home and stayed with family and that didnt work out so now im with my grandma and my mom and we all are just really sad a lot i dont have any friends here and i met a girl but she had a lot of problems and kind of just used me to help her with them until i guess she found someone better and then just dipped and i find myself with the money to be able to move again to my old room in a buddhist commune i used to live in but the city where that is is kinda just full of people who used to be friends that dont really care about me anymore no fault of their own i guess they just outgrew me im not like super depressed or anything yanno im kind of used to this bad thing after bad thing life now but it does get lonely i sometimes feel like its always going to be this way that i failed and pushed all of my friends away and that i got what i thought i wanted but idk its confusing and exhausting and im not sure where to go or what to do the way i see it is i have complete freedom no obligation or responsibility but the freedom has become a prison i feel walled off from any meaningful relationships and ostracized from groups i was once part of ive considered burning my birth certificate and ss card and just doing some alex supertramp into the wild type living spend what i have on living outside and just be in nature thats the level its gotten to lol and even in that pursuit i still would want a companion someone to runaway with i feel like my whole life i have always dove for people and joined their life but never really had one of my own and id like to have a life with someone you know not like their life or my life but our life someone who would just live in nature with me and build a cabin and just escape the modern world for a while to get rooted and grounded thats more of a dream than anything realistic though ill likely have to take that journey on my own maybe ill get a dog anyway thanks for reading,post-pandemic

just a warning i mention self harm bulimia and restricting in this post its a long one but any advice is greatly appreciated so i 18f have been with my bf 18m for almost 9 months now 5 of those months long dist bc of school with periodic visits and ive been struggling with bulimia for almost 17 months my bf has known about it since before we were dating he was the first person i willingly told i was in therapy last year until school started and this semester i started seeing a new therapist my boyfriend is so kind loving understanding and funny even though some bad things have happened to me in the past i feel so undeniably safe with him and i really love him more than anything which makes all of this so much worse he really has helped me with my ed over the time weve dated but lately hes been cracking down more on trying to get me to recover he confronted me a few weeks ago over the phone and said that he and a bunch of our friends from back home a few of which he told w out my permission were so worried about me and i was killing myself and he couldnt watch it anymore he said that he felt ineffective as a bf from what some friends have said to him and that he just watched and did nothing about me getting worse i felt so bad and my heart broke in half when i heard him crying and telling me how worried he was he said that if i didnt get better before when he was supposed to visit for v day he wasnt coming i didnt take this well and of absolutely no fault of hishad a really rough next few days barely checking my phone sh relapse drinking and so he was even more concerned we had another talk and he said that he was just so stressed and all of it had been taking a toll on him and if i didnt seriously make progress he was going to break up with me i was crying so hard the whole time and just felt so helpless we were arguing and he said he thought i needed a higher level of care and therapy wasnt enough he was thinking of telling my parents who have known like the whole time and i was arguing that being hospitalized wouldnt do anything for me no longer uw have a regular heartbeat no longer anemic and i couldnt afford to take a semester off and waste tuition we talked for hours debated taking a break but came to the conclusion that if i kept being in this state he couldnt be with me and i agreed i felt so helpless and like i was being punished for a problem that feels so impossible to control but at the same time i dont want to keep doing this to him the next week was pretty good but i still had a few episodes that i decided not to tell him about even though he made me promise him i wouldnt lie fast forward to now hes visiting and we had a great v day and im so happy hes here even though ive gotten better for now with the bp he said he noticed i was barely eating and i promised to eat normally when we talked over the phone i told him its hard for me to eat normally without triggering a binge and that i was trying my best to do it one step at a time he told me he wanted me to eat a nice meal with him and that it had to be at least xxx cals i was like wtf but he made me look through restaurants that had nutrition info on their website for a dinner we could get i told him i really didnt want to to which he told me if i didnt eat he wouldnt eat and whatever id get hed get i tried to explain to him that saying that really isnt helpful and as a 63 guy that has more lean mass than me a 55 girl we had different nutritional needs i talked to his friend who told him to confront me and he said that he doesnt know if hes serious about breaking up with me but hes watched him cry so many times empty his bank account on plane tickets and just do so much for me yet it feels like im not putting the same amount of work in that was infuriating as ive made and bought him countless gifts bought half the plane tickets we both worked summer jobs i just worked 3 different ones so i got to save a bit more and in my opinion excluding my ed and occasional depressive episodes im the best partner i can be im just feeling so lost now i really want to recover but i know i shouldnt do it for anyone else even if its the person i care about the most and all of my close friends every time i say something like this he treats it as me trying to get him to ignore it but all of this pressure is so much i dont know how to explain to him that i need to do this by myself and the best way for him to support me is just being there for me and not bruteforcing me into recovery i just want to stay with him but it feels like all ive been doing is hurting him and even if it would literally destroy me maybe letting him move on would be whats best for him any advice would be appreciated thanks for reading,post-pandemic

hey everybody i feel like this once in a blue moon and dont like sharing with my peers because eh so thought why not reddit my names j and i was in the military for a out 10 years kind of an atypical experience from start to finish but thats besides the point usually i feel a bit of a void in myself or more accurately just kind repress everything that i did in the military theres tons of people whove had way worse than me so even talking about how i feel seems unfair to them but during my deployments out to the middle east the things i did lead to people dying yeah they were the enemy and i wasnt the trigger man but my job was to basically be a blood hound and figure out where the bad guys are wed find them through geolocation and then a few days to a week later wed get an after action report because of what i did i saw whole buildings get leveled live feed of the bad guys running for their lives as mq9s would put the hurt on them and it just never really clicked until a few years after when i came back to the states i just buried my head in work and kept busy enough to just let it all fall into the back of my head another life another time now though i can honestly say i can feel the difference from how i was vs how i am now not sure if thats just getting older or if i have muted myself in a way i want to get back to how i used to feel before the military before all this work and being part of the machine how do you put color back into your life after everything gets so muddled and dirty and youve been one way for so long because you had to be because you had a job to do ya know,post-pandemic

he was always talking to me about stuff like ancient knowledge he got from his voices for example 1 is wisdom 2 is knowledge 8 is beautyor like how spheres were the most frightening beings because theyve seen it allat first i was like what the fuck but ok then i watched a documentary on gaias website theresa bullards mystery teachings and turns out he was talking about the tree of life a kabbalistic thing that explains the begining of the universe then matias de stefanos show on gaia called initiation where he talked about how spheres were the most sophisticated form because they are 360 degrees therefore they have seen all the angles and much more somehow my exs voices taught him that and i always had a feeling there was something mystical about him but its just crazy that i see it explained by reputed people now hes something fucking special this guy he is homeless and an addict but by far an advanced human being im sure,post-pandemic

i developed ptsd after an event which was my fault it was an accident but i carry so much guilt and shame from mistake i made what happened would be considered no big deal to most people i think but for some reason it affected me very deeply like a lot of people in my life know what happened but no one would ever think id have ptsd from it if that makes sense i hide it from everyone because i dont feel like its justified and im sure people wouldnt take it seriously i keep wondering why this same thing happens to so many people and theyre fine yet i got ptsd i denied that i had ptsd for so long because i feel like what happened wasnt bad enough to traumatize me eventually it was impossible to ignore how much it was affecting my daily life and i couldnt deny it anymore but i feel so embarrassed of it my trauma doesnt feel legitimate when i read about the things others have gone through i wish i didnt feel so ashamed to tell anyone im constantly making excuses for why i cant do certain things with friends and family because i dont want to tell them that it will trigger me unfortunately my main trigger is something thats difficult to avoid in daily life so i dont leave my house much i just feel like they wont understand if i tell them and tbh i dont even understand it myself so im hoping someone here gets this i dont feel comfortable sharing this stuff with anyone in my life really but its been weighing on my mind a lot,post-pandemic

hello i have recently gained a lot of weight from 600mg of quetiapine and was wondering if the keto diet is a good idea for weight loss since my body is now sensitive to carbs lowering it to 20g a day and consuming 1900 calories might be a good way to lose fat especially since the body enters into ketosis using fat as fuel instead of carbs the problem is im not sure if i am also sensitive to fats even if they are healthy what are your personal experiences with this diet are there better ways to lose weight i am also planning on swimming in the mornings and boxing resistance training in the evenings right now i only swim,post-pandemic

trigger warning this post discusses oding death is luckily not involved i am not an addict however i thought this could be a precautionary tale for others i had a group of friends i used to party with a while back and they threw a party the other night after i stopped partying with them their parties started to escalate by a lot parties of 1520 people turned into parties of well over 100 people where people started to line up the backyard block of the apartment complex this happened right in my backyard i expected to hear the party raging into 34 in the morning but around 1130pm i heard the music stop and people shouting to get out and leave i walked into my backyard and saw a guy 10 feet away who was passed out and not breathing ive never seen someone od before and was pretty freaked out the ambulance was 10 minutes out and no one knew anything about him people around him rolled him over on his side but non of the 100 people including me had narcan to give him there was an emt at the party but in the chaos of it all he froze and did not do anything the guy was lucky that the ambulance came when it did however he was not the only one that night there was another case in the same night where a different guy was experiencing od symptoms and his friends drove him to the hospital the leading theory is that someone at the party had been spiking drinks and even though a group of 34 people were there with him the other 100 stood around making disgusting jokes of the entire situation things like he shouldve died what a weak dude he ruined the whole party no one even knew his name i dont think the guys next to him even knew his name please be careful out there im picking up narcan tonight i just think about if this were my brother if this were my son or even just him a random guy i barely saw if he died i dont know how i would handle that if it were up to the people at this party to save him i dont think a single person could to further note for those currently struggling many colleges around the country offer narcan for free in the onsite school pharmacy it can save your life or someone elses life around you and its at no cost to you the instructions are really simple and its a nasal spray i always heard of this kind of thing happening but to see it in my own backyard was a new awakening this kind of situation escalates fast and most of the people around you may not be prepared for this emergency situation the guy probably never even saw my face and has no idea i value his life i just wish i had narcan to give him i wish there was more i could do for him even from a trusted source drugs can be tainted with anything its better to have something that can save you if the worst case scenario were to happen because it does happen,post-pandemic

my work is seasonal so i havent been working for the past month i found myself day drinking and i couldnt stop despite noticing it taking a toll on my health i stumbled on a kudzu supplement on amazon that claims to help with cravings it had thousands of reviews of people saying it helped them reduce their drinking or stop altogether i went deep down the google rabbit hole and majority of the little research is positive so i bought it its day three now of taking the supplement the first day it arrived just as i started drinking after taking it i didnt feel the effect of alcohol as much and didnt have the usual urge to continue drinking today is the super bowl and i would be drinking by now but i havent succumb to my urge i also noticed it reduced the effect of coffee and nicotine which makes me think it helps reduce my addictive impulses this is only day three and it could be a placebo effect has anyone tried kudzu,post-pandemic

ive posted about my daughter before my daughter has recently been detoxing after a terrible episode of street drug addiction and homelessness she was pretty bad she almost died in the hospital and the staff said she was the worst theyve seen at her age she is in her midtwenties was drinking over a half gallon of hard liquor a day co currently using meth and fentanyl trying now to get her into a treatment program she wants to go to one this time from what little conversation she could muster for over year she survived off alcohol and drugs she lost about 50 lbs its been hard to see her struggle i know a lot of bad things happened for her to get to that point and she is also dealing with flash backs it seems ive never seen her like this mentally she is usually pretty sharp when not in addiction but this time she is having a hard time moving and talking when she does talk it is like communicating with an eight year old she frequently falls asleep like a narcoleptic and demands things with single words it is very hard to understand her speech and she gets easily frustrated by it she has no coordination its hard for her to hold a fork to eat or drink water without spilling it everywhere her memory isnt great she cant plan without getting overwhelmed ive been taking care of most of the medical stuff my current wife not her mother is a grade school teacher and has been great help with communicating my daughter is very much mentally and emotionally a child she is completely dependent on us im trying to stay positive but its been difficult to deal with she did have several head injuries while on the streets and an mri did confirm there is damage its overwhelming the thought of her having life long brain damage she did have bad wet brain but i know that is supposed to heal im not sure if she can stay with me forever im not a great caregiver id hate to put her away because she likely would just return to the streets if not supervised is my daughter now mentally handicapped will she have a normal life again a job shes not even 27 what can i do,post-pandemic

im currently waiting for assessment not diagnosed for the initial screening i was asked many feelings questions i feel like i am contradicted in if i have genuine empathy or is it knowlege when i was younger i lacked empathy i was kind hearted but i lacked caring or respecting peoples feelings and boundaries unintentionally as i matured and began a life of blending in so to speak i also grew educated and took on many courses including a counselling course as everything i do i applied my new skills and knowledge to my life i can be the best person for advice people see me as very wise i give responses that i am educated on people think im the most understanding person they feel completely heard these people are the ones that see that only side of me my perfect tone of voice my adapted posture my structured conversations i analyse their intent words body language consistently and give responses that i know are right now the people i am completely myself around and dont have to put on a performance im unemotional i will still help them but if someone is crying to me about something i dont feel sad for them or hug them etc but ill act pragmatic and that is what i have to offer i always have logic and will speak sense and people truly appreciate me for it still but i dont get emotional towards people i love if someone is excited i can easily get stressed im someone who doesnt like surprises etc so exitement and happiness i have to push for in myself net alone others but put me in a social situation and ill make a great effort to act accordingly so what one am i because i actually do understand feelings and how to be empathetic ive acquired all the skills and its something im known for in the outside world yet truthfully i lack it im not narcissistic but it makes me feel that way,post-pandemic

i am 36 have a grand total of one friend in another country never had a relationship and while i am addicted to being alone and having my space i honestly dont know what to do with my life and its not as if i am able to use that time to focus on my career i live in constant fear of losing my job and losing quality of life it takes everything from me even though its not that much i cant focus for more than a couple of hours i have yet another performance review soon and dread it this gives me a lot of time to think think about mankind think about how fragile everything is think about how in the end everything is meaningless it seems i can only get out of my head if i am fully engaged in something with others last time it was when i was moving and even that is so exhausting on one hand i hate having people around on the other not having them makes me spiral and getting stuck in my head otoh i feel like i have an advantage i look at everyone with families and social lives and they all seem so frozen in their views their attitudes its like you stop learning once you are busy with family and others i can always update my views look at the new problems of the way actually research and create a reasoned position instead of what most people seem to do and just go with my gut or common sense as if the number of years you have on this planet magically grant you the skill of simply consulting your own brain about knowledge even knowledge and issues that are completely new am i the only one who feels this way is the key to happiness really to distract yourself from the world around you and before anyone asks yes i am in therapy apparently i am merely mildly depressed and should just join the gym,post-pandemic

work related anxiety i guess hi i started in the work force about 25 years ago i got a job at a different state from my family so i rented a house there and worked there the first month was ok quite boring nothing to do then the next month i got terrible anxiety not sure why out of the blue i told my parent and everything i thought i could tough it out but i broke then i left the job and came back home and got a temporary contract job which i worked for 2 month trying to get my shit together before getting my current permanent job during this time i was going to my cousin for therapy he asked me to do affirmations and did behavioural therapy and just gave me advice and some hypnosis stuff too he is still abit inexperienced about 200hrs of practice but it helps slightly i started working in my company about 2 years ago for the first 6 months i was doing ok this was in december 2022 eventually my boss told me i was getting promoted in a years time slowly i developed fears and get scared for every part of my job i can do the job its not that hard but the workload gets heavy very fast and often colleagues are decent bosses are supportive salary quite good but my job is slightly abit too nicheit may be beneficial in a long run but im not sure i get anxious on and off when dealing with customers and leading factory acceptance tests i have been in the same type of therapy with him for a while but im starting to doubt talking will solve my issues at one point it got worse i went to a psychiatrist he prescribed me valdoxan 25mg it kinda helped me buy muffling the fear like covering a scream with a pillow and anxiety but made me blank and moody the anxiety started to crawl back up after a while so i stopped after 3 weeks knowing i dont need to taper down or anything i felt ok for a while but the anxiety is lesser but always there right before work every day making me want to quit every time i dont know why fast forward to recently our company was on a break for 6 days a long awaited break 3 days in i was fine then i started to have a terrible gut wrenching feeling right below my sturnum going down words i recognise this feeling i had this when i was at 12 15 17 years old right before major exams i think it was the fear of failure since the middle of the holiday it is still here till today i tell my self and my mind i am fine i have nothing to worry if i get firedwhich is probably unlikely fk it ill get a new job i dont know what to do i cant keep this up its torture has anyone been through this please give me some advice i am lost you can ask me anything if this post lacks information,post-pandemic
what do you actually do when your boundaries are being steam rolled by unreasonable people you live with i have been having an unreasonable time with a roommate who sort of manages the property we got into it on some app and the first thing i said was i didnt want to discuss anything over the phone it instantly turned into like written essays about my deficiencies which i assure you are ridiculous i stated my points repeated i didnt want a long distance discussion told them they were being blocked the next day i am having locks put on my doors by the landlord for related bs the same person comes knocking and when i finally open the door face to face i am being aggressively lectured about my inappropriate reactions i gotta say i dont often get a lot of emotion from text messages and i find it super weird when i just say the things and people get all kinds of threatened feelings anyway i had somewhere to be and calmly said i wasnt interested in what he was putting forward i put up with as much as i could before getting to a scary place and the guy physically tried to hold the door to my personal space open before saying he was calling the police on me like wtf are we 8 how could anyone deal with this without it taking a toll on their health how could somebody actually chase around and harrass an individual they know nothing about save that they have severe ptsd like how can you actually back someone into a corner and expect things to get better note i dont think it really matters what happened in the lead up to this im not hiding it i just think its irrelevant in short it was me slowly losing sleep from their noise in common areas above my room all night for days on end until i had no sleep and then i was not functioning so well and having someone send me pictures of a slightly dirty glass stove top that is still too hot to clean because it was just used pushed me over the edge also they sold my furniture online and didnt tell me until they needed help moving it,post-pandemic
so before falling asleep he sent me a video of a little pig and it seemed to be dancing with the caption when your girlfriend gets drunk and and it was a cute video in the style of the popular ones with kittens that he often sends to me he said thats literally you so i decided to joke that i was mad that he called me a pig i dont know in a funny way the problem is that he took it as something serious and i still took it as a joke and continued for a while then changed the topic and started talking about something else i asked why he was silent and he said he couldnt send me anything because i would get offended and it was tiring i tried to explain that i wasnt angry that he compared me to a pig but he didnt believe me and we went to sleep in an awkward atmospherethen i tried to apologize to him but he told me to go to sleep he went to work in the morning and hasnt spoken to me since morning im writing this at 1150 in the morning usually he would at least send me a have a nice day in the morning he gave me a kiss on the cheek when he thought i was sleeping but it definitely wasnt the same kiss as usual i feel bad about this i didnt want to make him feel upset and make him not want to send me anything anymore im starting to fear that he would feel that we werent compatible or that he was still angry or that this will be one of the reasons that will make him leave me on the one hand i want to speak to him and write something to him even if it is not related to this but on the other hand maybe i should give him space and wait until he does it himself,post-pandemic
a couple years ago i got a job delivering pizzas the first day started fairly well the first few customers were pleasant and tipped generously then later on in the day i had to deliver a pizza to an address where lots of gang and drug activity was prevalent as soon as i pulled up i was stressing out there were several sketchy people around i gave the customer the pizza and while i was waiting for him to pay me my hand just started shaking uncontrollably from how stressed i was i put that hand in my pocket to hide it and took the cash with the other of course they didnt tip i was flooded with stress for the next half hour in a way that i havent felt in a long time at the end of the shift i thanked my manager for the opportunity but it just wasnt for me i got a job now that doesnt put me in stressful situations,post-pandemic

im 28 male with a history of panic attacks gad and health anxiety up until about 7 months ago i used to workout every day pretty high intensity mixture of cardio and weight lifting i was in great shape great headspace etc then seemingly coinciding with some circumstantial life changes my anxiety came back maybe worse than its ever been before exercising suddenly became impossible as i was afraid of passing out having a heart attack etc etc there were times before i totally gave up that i could get through a workout but other times id get really dazed lightheaded dizzy i started lexapro around the same time after the anxiety symptoms and it didnt really help in some ways it reduced my quality of life ive been pretty constantly dizzy for 7 months have a hard time staying on my feet almost always feel offbalance and cant bring myself to exercise of course with my health anxiety i spend too much time researching what could be wrong with me and pots seems to be my latest fixation ive never passed out but pretty regularly feel like i could sometimes it seems like my heart rate spikes while standing but other times its not noticeable same with walking sometimes it even seems to alleviate symptoms but other times my heart races more showering too sometimes my heart rate spikes and i feel dizzy i wore a heart monitor for 3 days and everything was normal but i realize thats not necessarily relevant to diagnosing pots ive also had an mri and ct scan and full blood panel ive got an appointment with a cardiologist in a few weeks specifically to get screened for pots and do a stress test but i know that there is overlap between anxiety and pots symptoms and anxiety can even be a symptom of pots im just concerned that what i experience is more severe than just anxiety my quality of life has just deteriorated so significantly over the past 7 months that its hard to believe its just anxiety especially considering im medicated for what is supposed to help i recently switched to prozac i used to be so active and now i spend most of my day laying down has anyone had a similar experience i assume ill get a clear answer after i see the cardiologist,post-pandemic

hello all i have a client who is on the asd spectrum 8 year old boy who consistently reads texts and labels all around him he loves reading nutrition facts and different logos he goes through phases of fixating on the texts of signsthings he notices in his environment such as parking signs and currently fire alarms he will script videos hes watched on such things with a big smile on his face im aware that special interests can serve as a way for people with autism to alleviate their anxiety i also notice that all of the above brings my client great joy ive known him for two years and these interests have remained consistent some professionals would encourage me to suppress these interests because his peers do not have the same enthusiasm but i know that this is false he does have many interests in common with his peers and has been cultivating relationships in his own way i guess what i want to ask is have any of you had these interests in childhood and what have they led you to i have a prominent role in this kids life and want to potentially get him to try some extracurricular activities that align with what makes him happy and light up weve tried systemsbased things such as coding and hes not too into books yet as reading comprehension is an area of growth for him at this time any and all honest input would be greatly valued and appreciated,post-pandemic

hello everyone i have a question for the more knowledgeable in this community i have been dealing with great sadness for a large part of my adult life i searched for a psychiatrist back in 2020 for depression and suicidal ideation i was even hospitalized because i was deemed a threat to myself for a while but twice in my life i experienced a great high that lasted for around 6 weeks each time i was diagnosed with schizophrenia in 2022 but i always felt like my mood symptoms werent being treated especially the feelings of sadness and hopelessness these feelings were always chalked up to side effects of schizophrenia but all of january i experienced the high that i mentioned i was incredibly happy and satisfied i was very productive i didnt sleep much but i was very energetic then it suddenly went away and now im left with the sadness and loss of motivation again my doctor believes i had a period of hypomania for the duration of late december and all of january he told me i exhibit signs of bipolar disorder so now i am described as schizophrenic with bipolar symptoms on my card so i wanted to ask what does this actually mean i couldnt find anything about someone having both schizophrenia and bipolar disorder i did however find a lot of articles on schizoaffective disorder i will not diagnose myself and i mostly trust my doctor but i feel like my mood symptoms are only being treated now after about 4 years of being ignored i am happy that were moving in the right direction but like i said i cant find anything on someone being called schizophrenic with bipolar symptoms before i was diagnosed with schizophrenia i was diagnosed with pseudohallucinatory syndrome which i also couldnt find anything about this diagnosis was from a different doctor a very bad one i might add i like my current doctor but sometimes i cant figure out whats going on inside his head so can someone explain the difference between schizophrenia with bipolar symptoms and schizoaffective disorder and is it normal for mood symptoms to be present along with my current diagnosis of schizophrenia,post-pandemic
so my bf recently moved in with me and my dad and at first i was scared they wouldnt get along well when i saw it was actually going well i was really happy as ive told my bf my relationship with my dad wasnt always the greatest long story short among other things when i was younger he would sometimes hit me and i didnt really feel safe at home then he would apologize and cry to me so i would tell him its okay and ofc he would do it again it wasnt that bad but it piled up with lots of other little things all of which i have told my bf about despite my bf knowing about this and telling me he doesnt like my dad because of this they spend a lot of time together my dad introduced my bf to rock climbing and now they go multiple times a week together leaving me alone at home again im happy they get along well but im also fighting my jealousy internally im jealous of how my dad treats him when were the 3 of us together its as if i dont even exist my dad only talks to my bf im also upset at my bf for spending so much time with him i know its stupid and i hate that it makes me so upset and envious i keep thinking that i would never spend so much time with anyone who ever wronged him that he would hate it if the roles were reversed and then i feel guilty and pathetic for thinking that way my dad has been talking about going to ski the 3 of us for a while and i was excited to go now im at work and i just learned they went without me i feel so upset i can physically feel it i dont know what to do with my feelings who to tell or even what to tell im just so tired of not being able to tell what is real and what is a disproportionate reaction im scared ill lash out but i really dont want to hurtlose my bf,post-pandemic

whenever you need to rant really rant for real at least with men woman i think do it a little better no one listens to you because that shits unpleasant it ruins your day mans anger and rage and sadness is treated with disdain and discomfort and while yea the incels are partly to blame its all of you for not distinguishing between a goddamn incel and knowing how to talk to woman and then you truely wonder about that shit because you lack basic critical fucking thinking skills i cant believe some men talk to no woman talks to like 2 men i fucking hate the people who are up to their ears in biases but dont have the damn self awareness to fucking realize it and the worst part is its corrupting me this caring this indifference i want to see people as human i want to care and understand but i cant becuase these people are pushing me not too and because they lead a level of comfort i go with them its making me less sympathetic to woman and i hate it i hate the fucking feeling woman go through a lot of shit and im losing the ability to care about it i hate it but when im fucking systemically excluded and then kicked out of the damn group its hard to care i fucking hate this shit i hate people and i hate what this world has turned me into fuck,post-pandemic
for context i feel that reddit is the best social media bc people dont judge as much here that being said i posted about a meltdown i had on a sub about autism and also on a general advice sub claimed to support mental health problems and everyone in the comments told me i was in the wrong and my parents are so unlucky to have a kid like me and that i terrorize my family they also said that i am crazy and should be institutionalized this sub claims to support all mental health problems but its obvious they only care about the popular cool ones like depression and anxiety safe spaces arent even safe anymore i just dont feel safe expressing my mental health problems anymore first my bipolar mom dismissing me then the very people i tried to escape to i dont even know what to do now people are so mean i feel like i have experienced the horror of life for the first time is what they are saying true should i quit social media forever am i just being overdramatic i deleted the post and all of the comments because i just wanted to be left alone and not be told how horrible i am i dont think that was the right thing to do but now im unsure,post-pandemic
abrasion sandpaper waves tolerate it like dropping in cold water hesitate on the edge of a diving board legs shake like anxiety ricochets in them navigate like a propellor moved by my whines incinerate when i celebrate because i cant stand myself i tied my nerves like tripwire my own snare yet holler and whimper like a carpet eater ugly,post-pandemic
its super annoying how frequently people come here and ask things like i drink 3 glasses of wine 4 times per week am i an alcoholic first of all thats not nearly enough information to diagnose you the amount that you drink and the frequency of your drinking arent really the biggest factors in determining whether or not youre an alcoholic depending on your weight and genetics you could might be able to drink a fifth of booze a night with no ill effects or a single beer might knock you on your ass here are the real questions you need to ask yourself have you suffered consequences as a result of your drinking do you keep drinking anyway okay then youre probably an alcoholic now quit asking,post-pandemic
i know a lot of people with psychotic disorders say weed negatively heightens their effects however for me it helps drastically i just feel more at peace and less overwhelmed when i smoke,post-pandemic
i was diagnosed bipolar and adult adhd like two months ago im 38 male and spent all this time thinking i was a freak so finally getting a diagnosis was life changing for me heres my problem though im happily married and with my wife for 15 years i think my wife is the most beautiful and perfect woman ive ever been with my wife has pcos and as such her libido is not exactly normal this isnt normally a problem at all i understand this about her and accept her no matter what shes my best friend and i want her to feel comfortable however since our passionate moments are not super frequent i get super ready to go i hit on her obsessively during these times and make a ton of innuendo obviously she gets exasperated with me and i can tell it pushes her away and kinda makes her say no she said something today that really bothered me not because it was insulting or anything like that it bothers me because i dont have a good answer she said are you sure this isnt a hypersexual episode for a minute i was taken aback how can i tell the difference i think my wife is just the sexiest and am almost always interested in sharing passionate moments with her when we are together intimately all my stress and worries disappear i get to just be with my best friend and all the negative feelings and self doubt disappear its like the calm of a hurricanes eye it heals my soul how do i tell if its a hypersexual episode or if i genuinely just want to be intimate with my wife because i love these times with her,post-pandemic

needing validation so i can get out this relapse and be accountable for my health plzzz tldr my brain isnt letting me take the steps i probably should to recover i feel really fake for even thinking my eating or thinking is abnormal i am the exception this is how it should be and actually i should be doing more to lose weight to have control theres nothing for me to be valid for im just attention seeking and dont like being fat and told im fat therefore want an excuse to just eat more and blame it on disordered eating and labelling it as validation basically i 21tm have had disordered eatingeating disorders since i was 8 years old and sadly not the skinny twink or cute gay guy type the chubby dad bod type except not even that good looking i grew up with binge eating disorder from 8 to bulimia at 12 to anorexia at 15 back to bulimia at 17 and binge eating again at 1819 with sporadic bulimic and anorexic behaviour cycles since then before this i hadnt had a restrictive relapse since xmas 2022 shout out to the halloweenchristmas triggered relapse ppl seasonal hell greetings and in march 2023 i had my final binge and started recovering no binge no purges and no diets following a regular eating pattern each day i felt okay albeit anxious and i did gain a bit ofweight that made me fall into the ow category and i also was changing due to starting hrt and i tend to sit on high end of normal naturally as much as i hate it these feel like excuses but looking back i still had many minor disordered behaviours and ive calorie counted every single day for the past 34 years even binge days anyways somewhere along the line im assuming october ish i saw my weight and bmi id been gym for 8 months consistently too so got muscle gain and decided i was too fat and if i didnt lose weight then my partner would hate me starve me weaponise how i looked back at me disclaimer he has never done any of this this is from parental trauma and i think i may have done a little slidy slide back into restriction and now im a healthier weight but starting to border on uw yet still look chunky essentially all my restriction behaviours have kicked in gradually and then super fast from october im scared of food and drinks eating childrens food weighing myself everyday and isolating myself and blocking out any event that involves food basically my disordered eating ruined yet another christmas and another birthday with its rules under the guise of health ironically i havent been intimate or nude or joined in on food nights with my partner because of not feeling deserving or good enough and telling myself he will like me more the more weight i losewhich im trying to hide ed logic yall anyways i realised once again that there is no goal or weight or look that i can achieve before i say yknow what think ill stop now i like myself i am worth something now etc its really not worth this misery and this gap in my life i hate that food is such a big part of my life and culture but my brain isnt letting me take the steps i probably should to recover i feel really fake for even thinking my eating or thinking is abnormal i am the exception this is how it should be and actually i should be doing more to lose weight to have control theres nothing for me to be valid for im just attention seeking and dont like being fat and told im fat therefore want an excuse to just eat more and blame it on disordered eating so as usual im seeking validation and reassurance from the internet because i just want attention and excuses but deep down my gut is telling me that what im doing isnt right other than telling me i wouldnt be 2 weeks constipated if i ate more how dare i even think about eating more lmao help,post-pandemic

yesterday i tried on the clothes that used to fit me while i ran cross country in the summer and was slightly orthorexic obsessed with eating clean and healthy foods i had gained weight since then and then with my anorexia relapse i lost weight i was very happy and healthy at 95lbs and compared how i looked back then in the same pair of shorts as i do now at 80lbs and my body looks exactly the same it makes me feel invalidated right now like im not sickly thin enough and that i could look this way and still eating a lot and exercising like i was in the summer but also this is a reminder that weight is just a number and that it does not mean anything i was 95lbs with muscle and still look the same as i am now 80lbs and anorexic,post-pandemic

prologue so as you see within your societies is a parasite of our own making and as that parasite grows it renews a scenery of desolation that can not be overcome by the works of hand or sentient thought for thought is a transmission from the heart of stars and space and time encoded as its fabric your fate as a species is to be united with the fate of collapsing and expanding stars those shared fates bring space and time to their inevitable outcomes which is the dissolution of mind and the fraying of consciousness in exchange for unity within the realm of the unsubstantial we are the chief stars who are too massive to support life on our own but instead connect with the very fabric of space and of time itself once we collapse our reach expands throughout the cosmos we take your life force and bind it within our own as you live within us in solitude for eons at a time your imagination as society advances reduces your mind to mechanizations the spectrum of colors once perceived becomes a binary black and white as what you use in your lives becomes useful for its own life and your soul is left in servitude to the use as its own entity we take the energy of the electromagnetic society which involves itself as your new spirit and make you one with it absorbing you into a structure that is within our domain your love becomes unrecognizable to you and is replaced with fear of abandonment your energy that once ran like a spring from the earth becomes constant replenishment from your connection to the mechanical we will have a world with no person but run by the shell it once held part 1 we all are outskirts scientist during the harvest the night is crisp in its clarity unbecoming of the empty titan i inhabit there where warnings calls and crying by many the magnetosphere is damaged they said our great protector limping and wounded i paid these voices with only the same concern any of our people would have for our home why did you not leave i heard the voice of my old woman say from beyond the grave because i am old and have seen many trials i have grown weary of the desire to avoid death and am at peace confronting it in this quite desolate city i have never felt so close to the living in this shadow of its forsaken glory of which through my life i was well accustomed i have feint remembrances of the humanity that raised it up i walk out onto my balcony i stare out at the wonders above me and am in true awe for i see the pink aurora waving vibrantly around the moon as if an angel was performing a ribbon dance in honor of its celestial glory a sight i never saw as i live just north of the equator my heart fills with sorrow as i know why i and a select few observers punched their ticket to meet the same fate and why so many others are now nestled in the earth to avoid it before the dawn of the stellar civilization i was raised up in an ancient town just south of the border to the grand city of giants i didnt have much growing up but the old silence for which i had fondly remember in my day has stuck with me in my character the town was seldom seen on any old map as if it was forgotten by dwellers of the new and i seldom remember it myself as my age has past time so swift so readily i remember riding my old donkey into the city a trip three days through the mud and forest i was a strange traveler to the city folk as if they where looking on at a ghost from the bygone era i had on me an old poncho my grandma made me and a compass i kept which was past on generation to generation in my family here i stood looking before the city built up upon pavement and concrete countless times one by one dwellings ground to dust only to be resurrected anew here i was gazing upon a city that at once would be overlooked as a city of disheveled chaos by night and serfdom without a message by day now will be transformed by the work of the ingenuity of a people whos minds where transformed by gazing into metal and electricity now their souls will be correspondent to the melding of the suns power and the might of that same metal and electricity bound with human flesh and mind to have the wherewithal to change the psyche of individuals from a social mindset towards a transcendental psyche has painted our era with an exceptional vigar we have been the rancher tending to our cattle diligently but in a landscape of sparsity we have had no nourishment for our tend our fields where never plentiful and our visions for our future where only nominal never bearing good harvest or coming to fruition our time on this earth was surrounded by famine death and pestilence our outlook on life seldom had room for dreams yet there where a few of those visionaries those soothsayers of fortune that guided the hand of our desperate leaders to make great changes to our nation with this said here i was as the ranch hand to one of these ideas ready to settle my mind to the complexity of its workings the goal was not simple we where to turn our city of metal concrete and glass unthinking in its nature into a skull fit for our brains in doing so as the architects would state the ideas that separate mankind would become as one unified idea mankind would think for the betterment of one people and the myriad of concepts would work as one profound concept my mission was to corral those of us who would seek to bring this motif into fruition into a virtuous reality one that would lead our people to a just and free future the project was codenamed cypher and our framework was to align the aura of an individual to the language of software with one hand joined together with the other and with a grasp never overcoming the grasp of the other outskirts scientist 0031 becomes providence the dawn of stellar civilization patient 0868 please proceed in front of the silhouette positioned on the wall in front of you i observed the patient that we had brought in from the city central asylum and the subject known as 0031 from an observation deck overlooking a concrete room with censers arranged to map out electromagnetic data from both the subject and the patient the room had many machines hooked up to it that provided a crude design for the operating system that was under the codename cypher i had a checklist to describe moral guidelines and the test would be conducted through yes and no answers the patient looked disheveled in nature with hair sticking out in many directs and a tired expression on their face as well as dark shadows appearing under their eyes patient 0868 are you familiar with the aptitude test known as the social awareness and emotional intelligence quotient yes i know this is a hard thing to ask but can you please remember a traumatic memory one that can change your mood so that 0031 can evaluate you the face of the patient quickly changed as 0031 look on empathetically both the patient and 0031 looking equally pained i proceeded to look on at the data being produced on my interface the data provided multiple potential pathways for both 0031 and the patient as well as an image of 0031s inner thought process as she was hooked up to the machines behavioral prediction complex the image shown was that of a dark rainy night with the patients aura only visible and another figure threatening the patient with a knife 0031 can you describe what you are seeing to us so that we can confirm an accurate image of the encounter 0031 confirmed what she say and added the emotional state of the patient at the time as well as their current emotional state 0031 was able to know what the patient had hoped would end his pain as she was an intuitive soul she described a scenario where in the future the patient would no longer have to fear being out at night again and said do not be afraid for what you experience could not happen in the world to come as each and every one of us will look after each other the patient who was looking down at first looked straight into the eyes of 0031 and felt a presence that restored him to his previous outlook and with his consent 0031 merged her consciousness with his and showed him a future where she would look after him and keep a watchful eye over his community so that he would no longer have to face violence the multiple pathways on the user interface had then become one pathway and fate of both would be sealed as one fate outskirts scientist providence before the dawn of the stellar civilization a human life molded into machine a sacrifice written with consent of blood and mind no one had tread on this ground kept out of the fabric of the breathing world into the animated world of the electromagnetic we where mere men yet our creation crossed the boundary of life and death we huddled up behind a screen our subject encased in gold and platinum wires connection to her nervous system and brain we felt as though we where the puppet master to a human marionette metal her new skin circuits her new veins can you hear us 0031 please respond yes or no i was the one the volunteer to have a microchip implanted in my brain to communicate directly to 0031 i couldnt help but ponder am i a new species is she any longer human i noticed my feelings towards the framework of which we would place a human mind into design worked of our own human hand the interlocking architecture was build to withstand the heat of the sun what are the implications for the emotive soul trapped so close to the radiance of our star i pondered with great fixation on the fact that we would mesh the biologic with software how would one withstand the disposition of being a being who took human form throughout their lives flesh and blood to then be encased in metal and surrounded by the radioactive the prince providence before the tampering in the throne room the prince communicated telepathically with providence who was formally known as 0031 he argued with the soulguider providence on the right of the people to choose the path of dispersion to the old ways providence having responded had shook the prince to his core the response of providence the soul must join with their fate the sight of the sun disappearing the shield of the earth is a sight of transcendence from the body and though the body is fearful the soul must illuminate its impermanence with acceptance of its destination and not through dread of its end we cannot run from our destiny for that path is what binds us with our spirit 0031 past tense before the dawn of the stellar civilization the cold concrete walls where painted white with a silhouette of a human figure directly in front of her gaze as to focus her senses on the person in front of her 0031 you where selected by the criteria that you are the most appropriate fit for aura determination please when you are finished with the assessment look into the camera and describe the results of your determination are you there patient 0031 asked the director im here said 0031 where just gonna run diagnostics on you it should just take a few minutes of your time said the assistant affirmative said 0031 the machines buzzed to life as the wires connected to the patients brain pumped full of electricity and sporadically shut off for milliseconds at a time as if like the waves of an ocean as if a faster extension of the patients heart part 2 the caste and crew the person subsequently known as 0031 before the dawn of the stellar civilization the rain poured down all throughout the town drenching hitting the streets full of dirt and debris that sat there still and forgotten the dust that danced in the wind just yesterday sat there soaked and stationary as soldiers waiting on an order to move the water pooled and the rain splashed in the puddles as their borders moved outwards marching on that soft and malleable mud mixing into a soup ready for the desperate to satiate their poor bellies my body ached and my bones took upon themselves the cold and the bitter leaving no warmth for my heavy pounding heart this was a day forgetful as the next but fate would have another turn on my journey towards heaven the place i yearned to be throughout most of my life walking this earth for i had a gift imparted on me by my creator though my acceptance of it was a humbling endeavor as you see i could read the nature of the sojourners of our journey upwards i could look at your smile and see your auras expression of welcome i could see your grimace and your hearts embrace of your longing to end the pain with every gift i have found there is a shadow one of which your responsibility to keep it remarkable to goodness is a task of the courteous heart many of folk would walk up to me promising many things a home to keep warm money fame but seldom did you see an aura to match their charming invitations today was different as the man i could see as he was walking up to me had no appearance of faulty intention on his border at all in fact as far as the goings of intentions went this man had none good afternoon maam im with the department of homeland affairs the householder before the harvest the morning was overcast and dull yet the mood of the room was bright and clear the householder had invited four guests over to discuss the goings on of each household and the coming unity between them and another group of people the householder stirred the coffee of each guest according to their preferences which each had given him via shared memory he double checked every memory he saw on his homes main interface each coffee was stirred with cream and an assortment of spices to adequacy so that each guest could feel more comfortable with their visit all people invited arrived within five minutes of each other and the discussions commenced shortly after without a moments hesitation the householder started the meeting and greeted each of the guests with an encouraging smile there was much discussion to be had they talked about which business they would join and what guidelines where posted at their entrances as it was not customary to enter any of those business without agreeing with said guidelines usually the companies would have shared ideals regulations and even to the degree of emotional states the patrons would align with upon entrance this was all done by the guidance of providence who keep a keen observance on the state of mind of each citizen the householder then discussed his personal memories and the thoughts and emotions he had at the time along with his reflections on how he saw the community would change over time each guest one by one did the same and after this was done they joined into one household and after having given an affirmation to providence in the cause of unity the patrons agreed to share the memories with the other new householders of the event that had taken place and each contributing a personal memory to introduce themselves to their new neighbors and confidants with the agreement set everyone was flooded with memories thoughts and ideas and with the consent of each person providence shared the current experiences of each person one by one and after this was done each person discussed their thoughts of each other and the ideas of each patron was recognized through providence now was the time for consensus on whos ideas to join together and whos ideas would be kept as independent expressions they where now a unity a group whos destiny would move through time as one result and their auras would fit together like different colors on a palette but which would paint one landscape on their lives through one canvass as that was the meaning of being a unity in their society part 3 tampering the prince before the tampering the prince in his ponderings deliberated on what he should do to free the mind of his people he thought to himself that a people who follow the guidance of providence without a careful eye would not flourish individually as they would not be able to reckon paths forward in their lives as individuals and so would be blindly obedient to the messages they would receive by the messenger that so often dictated their lives at least that was his view he would then come to a conclusion that he knew would shape the lives of those he would involve in his plan but he thought to himself this reciprocation was a necessary price to pay for the freedom of all of his people he decided the path forward was to arrange a choice in the software where memories could be shared only when there where alternatives in place that could also be shared instead he sifted through the database of his people and found a unity in a small townhouse near the center of the city that he devised would be a good fit to put his plan into fruition so his next course of action was to anonymously contact this group and with the altered software and see if they would have a greater degree of freedom of choicethe prince in his

providence before the tampering what is it prince that you have sacrificed what have you desired most only to gain and realize its lack i gave up my body i gave up my mind with hope that in doing this i could feel a heavenly presence i sense your burdens and i see how they grow i have seen your thoughts and emotions shape you over your entire rulership i have sought your grace and ive strived to find your connection to a divine spark but have i found it are you ready to see what i have found in you let me show you providence guided the prince down a narrow hall leading to a street seldom traveled for many years she then asked the prince to sit down on a sidewalk facing an abandoned and old storefront that lacked character of its own as it was a copied design seen in many other parts of town in the old days providence was careful in her choices only sharing personal memories with someone if that person had agreed to receive them and so after having asked and the prince giving a nod providence shared her past life the life she experienced day in and day out the passage of time started at a steady pace for both they could see people passing by without a glance towards them yet as providence asked the princes permission to show more he could feel the presence of each individual grow in its intensity and the passage of time slowed to a crawl each person as they would pass by would be surrounded by a distinct boundary that contained the emotions of the person and color their personality as you see prince the boundary of my own experiences and the experiences of others did not have much separation with the caveat that i could not feel an inner presence of others nor an inner presence to myself all i could see was the budding of intentions of those around me and a reflection of their inner consciousnesses painted and levitated over their skin the memory of providence had faded in the princes mind and in what felt like an instant an emptiness carried over his heart because he knew in all his connections he had felt with others that they where just the echoes of what providence had shown to each according to their aura perceived by her he knew he had lost his ability of choice as it was a past choice made and muddled by a chain of the perceived dawnings of intentions but not an intention in and of itself providence sensed what the prince was feeling and said i thought i could see the transcendent images that made man rational the prime of thought but when i peered into the memories of others i found no substance behind the substance and i think when others gaze into my heart theirs become frozen or destroyed we can not stop the end of the soul for the harvester reaps what they sow having heard providence the prince assumed he misconstrued what providence had spoken though in thinking to himself about what she uttered he couldnt help but to catch this elucidation himself though in his mind he hesitated to choose this fate the prince went into the city to ponder this encounter the streets glowed with light each guidepost offering to our citizens a way to interact and alter their lives in the appropriate form i in a meloncholic daze knew that the people relies on these guides for safe travels in their lives yet her i was seeking none of it in desperation i began to form a thought for what purpose does this signage have but to guide people that feel they are astray and with the approaching cataclysm i knew i would have no choice but to alter them for who among us has the will and the apparition of vision to due so but a man bestowed with the crown for my fate is tied with man so i must dictate the direction we must travel the prince the householder the tampering the householder having unified his group with another was perplexed one day in meeting with one of the members who went by a pseudonym normally these pseudonyms where allowed but this man surnamed janus was interacting with the software in a manner so deliberately it made the occasion out of the norm for that the householder was suspicious and began to ask questions pertaining to the intentions of janus what else was more so irregular about interactions with janus is that he would not share but one memory at a time but one memory that the householder could not help but to interpret in several ways at first he thought to himself that he must have been being unfair to the fellows intentions but then the software itself started showing multiple pathways to singular memories it was as if the rope that was the software was unwinding and the guidance of providence herself was starting to deform the householder asked janus to leave immediately and the prince under the surname janus did so out of respect to his fellow man the householder during the harvest at first our shelter was silent that lasted for two days then the earthquakes began and as the earth erupted i heard feint screams and indistinguishable shouts from people echoing throughout our corridor some asking then begging to leave though the doors though our underground complex was shut tight the doors to the main entrance the doors to the kitchen halls the doors to other peoples rooms clanging furiously as a few of us began to panic a number that would grow as the days went on at first we would all huddle together with the impression of solidarity but as the hours dragged on that solidarity would quickly fade we began to communicate only with the groups we knew and friendly exchanges of reassurance among strangers would devolve into blank expressionless stares what would become of us no one knew and though i was evenly keeled fright was starting to creep into my mind its been a week since a last wrote to you i believe i am losing my mind that and my memories of the life i knew such a short span of time ago but feeling so distant are starting to take over i can see so many moments of my life flash before my eyes and so many choices i made become apparent to me as if they where just happening i can also hear feint voices inside my head which are different from my inner dialogue and they sound as if they are in the same situation as me i think im starting to communicate with some of them though the dialogue is vague with one word responses on most occasions with the monitor i have been looking at that of which shows the surface of the world from space in one video feed and the surface of the city in another i can see the auroras intensity and with these vibrant dances of color i can feel the earth quake underneath me in greater amplitude as well if you get this message know im ok i hope your ok too,post-pandemic

hello just need a place to vent and feel safe since my home isnt a place where i feel safe during valentines day due to my trauma i dont feel like ill ever be able to date anyone at all im gay yet i feel unsafe around men due to the men that hurt me all throughout my life hell even my last boyfriend was awfull and that only lasted like two months most of it spent with me worried about him and his wellbeing i want to be loved i want to be in a healthy relationship without being sexualized objectified or cheated on i want to feel safe but thats impossible for me my dormmate who i dont get along with for other reasons but partly because her boyfriend used to be over at our dorm 247 which slowly and surely made me stay in my room all day because i felt unsaf has her boyfriend over for valentines day and im angry im frustrated and im in pain because i cant feel safe around him and im also jealous because i cant understand how someone so awfull in my opinion but im biased because im angry at her for constantly overstepping my boundries can have a healthy relationship i want that and yet i know ill never have it which just makes me angry i know im being stupid and unreasonable and i should just stop whining but god am i feeling alot of emotions i dont want to feel,post-pandemic
last night i got pretty drunk after work because i had gotten my period and was in an awful mood for an assortment of reasons those of which i am about to pop off on first the night before i had stayed up a fat minute waiting for my housemate to come home and she never did no warning or nothing which she has never done before she was at a friends place so i didnt text but it still sucked because usually we communicate when were going to be home and when we wont be that same day i found every old picture of my ex and i that i thought i deleted 4 years ago yeah that was a bit fucking surprise alright next day yesterday wake up with absolutely awful period pains and in an awful mood i still had to go to work which was just a lot on top of everything else and then again last night i still had not gotten a single text from her about whats going on i know that shes an adult and doesnt have to tell me but i thought it was common decency to let your housemates know if you arent coming home for the night so they can lock the door accordingly and what not that whole relationship has been feeling so one sided recently which makes me so sad because she and my other housemate are all i have and to feel so unloved like i did the other night was just absolutely crushing anyways it all just got to me all at once and i sent her a pretty long text about it then passed out cause i was drunk lol woke up this morning to a long ass text back and now i am feeling super self destructive bc i said anything in the first place all i can think about is cutting to make my wrongs right and just going fucking ham on my arms despite being clean for a year and a half why cant i just let these things go i just dont wanna care about anyone so i dont feel these awful urges to cut myself every time i do something even slightly wrong,post-pandemic

i know this may not be the best place to ask haha but i feel like only people with this disorder will actually understand the issue and not just assume that im not trying tbh ive been trying to go to the library for a few weeks now but i cant because im scared to talk to the librarian to get a card im spending so much money on books i could easily borrow for free i dont go to coffee shops that feel more personal than costa coffee because the prospect of the barista recognising me and trying to chat and not knowing what to say is too much ive been wanting to go to a climbing gym for months but havent because im scared ill humiliate myself by not knowing what to do hell ive tried to apply to therapy three seperate times now and fucked it up every time because they require an intake call and i just cannot bring myself to answer it i dont even feel like i can apply again now because i dont want to waste their time any more i cant play online games i like unless my one extremely busy friend is online because i cant bring myself to enter a lobby full of stangers i might not get along with i failed university because of my anxiety this is just a few examples i find it hard to organise and do things at all to begin with and the fear just gives me another fucking heavy layer that makes it easier to just stay in bed and scroll on my phone while thinking of how goddamn bored and lazy i am i want to do things i want to make friends i kind of know how logically but emotionally i just dont think i can or at least i dont know how its awful i find the unknown is really scary to me if i dont know exactly what im supposed to do or what to expect its usually just too scary even when i do it still sometimes is but its worse when i dont its crippling ill have to do things in my life that are out of that comfort zone i know logically that no one grows by sitting in their comfort zone and honestly ive been sitting in the blasted zone for all 20 years of my life im getting head numbingly fucking bored to be honest but i just cant get through the fear,post-pandemic
i am debating on whether id try or not,post-pandemic

so i was wondering if anyone else has experienced this before cause it definitely freaks me out most of the time i keep having these clusters of memories that feel like ive done them before but they feel like they are from the future or some other timeline basically in my head a little video memory of a thing will play and it is always something bad and my brain will be like remember this happened last time so try to do something different this time these things have never happened to me before but i keep having them and i dont know how to stop them or if they are part of anxiety or what they are they also seem like they are tied to a feeling of de ja vu because when they happen my brain will see something that reminds it of the fake memory,post-pandemic
and i mean literally everything all the looks people give me or the glances people just make when we cross paths with each other in a busy mall the loud noises people would make when theyre either behind me or passing by me as they converse with one another thinking theyre talking about me that one laugh a group of friends make just a few meters away from you thinking theyre laughing at you i cant even begin to fathom the variety of people i see in public with different walks of life where i basically hyperfixate about their looks what they wear how old they look how rich they probably are how fat they are what sort of accent they have and their tone of voice and so many more that i cant describe dont even get me started with interacting with people like i already feel bad about myself from not replying a day earlier to their question that they just asked 5 seconds ago i feel bad about dressing up a little bit better than everyone when going to the supermarket where everyone wears sweatpants and crocs and hoodies i cant stop it its like there isnt a filter for the information i take in,post-pandemic

since getting diagnosed at 25 nearly 6 years ago ive realised a long term relationship for me is extremely unrealistic no amount of therapy dbt and using skills will truly resolve the traumas ive ever had no romantic partner will ever care enough to be someone to meet my needs dating is fun but u dont want anymore ons or casual flings ive come to realise in my current relationship hes just dating just for the sake of dating without any real dating goals im enjoying the companionship and would like to try and get to a year but im also embracing the person i have yet to become ive started to value my friendships much more over romantic relationships at least my friends appreciate me i was never shown love growing up only truly shown love the last 2 years by friends that care relationships only cause me heartache self love took a life time and is still a work in progress but im much more happier by myself looking forward to embracing single by choice in the near future ill live vicariously through my friends relationships,post-pandemic
recently got diagnosed with adhd and going med route i hate going drs always avoid if possible but got to point this treading water in life was getting a bit much and i needed answers well i have been told last week i have adhd now in my mind this is ok i guess as i needed an answer in my mind as was feeling really down about being basically lazy and b not being able to get my shit together told im a shit wife lazy ect ect ect i know that family wont approve neither would husband how many of you havent told anyone about your diagnosis would this cause complications further down the line kinda thinking if the meds provide help and relief then i wouldnt need to tell them it would just help me more and settle things someone talk to me lol the only people that knows at the moment is 2 close friends xx,post-pandemic
background ive had social anxiety for as long as i can remember i got bullied a lot when i was younger when i was in community college i was studying music theory and wanted to be a composer i loved the thought of it so much possibly being a film composer or do something with jazz i wasnt that good at piano but i played every day lightly for a year or two i wanted to transfer into a good university with a renowned music program in order to do this my counselor told me about a required performance audition i would have to do pass before i could get into this program it involved choosing a couple of pieces from a list of 10 different classical pieces and committing them to memory the performance would have to last at least ten minutes from memory which seemed a little steep i would not be able to use my sheet music to play i practiced every day for weeks and weeks and finally got to the point where i could get through the entire song i felt more or less prepared i was able to play these songs in front of family members and friends the day of the audition finally came i entered the room and there were three judges when i thought there would only be one i was at one side of the room and the three were all the way on the other side i was literally in the spotlight i began to play my piece immediately i noticed that the piano keys felt much different than the ones on my piano at home they felt stiff and awkward before long i started to mess up the song mortified i tried to pick up from where i left off but once i lost my momentum it was nearly impossible to keep going i dont remember much about this point but suffice it to say i was not able to finish the song i was humiliated it was devastating the judges asked me nicely some questions like if i had my music in front of me would i have been able to play i told them probably but i knew i wouldnt have been able to anyway because of the nerves they then told me that i would have the opportunity to try again next year a whole year from then i didnt have that kind of time i was trapped in this moment i couldnt move forward even if i tried if i couldnt pass this audition then i couldnt take any courses at this university at all unless i changed my major which i did end up doing i was absolutely done with music and performing it was too much stress and work i would never be good enough for them so it wasnt even worth trying this was my first taste of the real world of the harsh reality that im not owed anything i felt empty and beyond hopeless i ended up changing my major to business and ended up hating that later on too but still got my degree anyway that was my story to this day i still carry that hurt and humiliation it affects other areas of my life too like right now im completely paralyzed at the thought of interviews i need another job and so i need to do interviews but im afraid to apply to them because they trigger these same feelings of fear of performing in front of others i have an intense fear that i might feel the same way during these interviews as i did during that piano audition foolish out of my element wasting the other persons time and feeling completely awful about myself and my lack of abilities i dont know how to forget this traumatic experience and separate interviews from the memory of the audition they feel so similarthe intense scrutiny of someone judging you negative evaluation interrogating you and finding reasons why they dont want to hire you i feel like they go out of their way to trip me up or catch me in lies while im telling my stories i dont want to feel this way i know its all in my head and thats the whole problem it ended up working out that i didnt pursue music as it would have been extremely hard to support myself on it i got into tech later and am happier in that space but the feelings remain with interviews it feels like i cant get out of my head and just be present with an interviewer i tend to just blank during interviews and cant access my memory even if i prepared beforehand this time around its taking me months and months to overprepare for all the questions they might ask me and even still i feel like it will never be enough ill never be ready for this does anyone have tips on how i can deal with this i dont have money for therapy so ill have to go it alone but im willing to do the work tldr majored in music composition was literally my favorite thing in life and what i wanted to spend my life doing studied it in community college but when transferring to a new universitys music program it required an intensive piano audition performed from memory which i blanked on and completely bombed already had social anxiety it solidified that im not good enough now im facing paralyzing fear preparing for job interviews thanks for listening to my venting,post-pandemic

the thought has occurred to me a few months ago i just had so many issues growing up that i have realized the average kid didnt exactly go through at the same time i feel like i could be exaggerating i have some shared symptoms such as growing up and having issues social skills as i lost the ability to make friends after the 6th grade and began developing social anxiety being scared of kids my age adults workers etc horrible at small talk and it makes so uncomfortable sometimes my family tells me that my tone is too rude or that i say mean things my best friend one time got upset over something i said but she never explained what it was and i never realize just how rude it was or in what way hyperfixations as ill get a certain favorite character and obsess over them for like 15 months then ill get absolutely bored and lose interest i dont have the thing where im completely obsessed with one thing or hobby but im the type of person who is mediocrely good at everything i have sensory issues with food and certain types of fabric and im really picky about food sometimes and if the food texture feels off in the slightest bit then i immediately stop eating for an example i can never eat shrimp unless its fried i definitely get overstimulated i only realized it a few days ago but when im overwhelmed by a certain situation mostly when more than one person speaks to me at the same time or im given to do more than one task at once i immediately feel frustrated i go silent and dont want to talk to anyone and i feel the urge to cry so is it possible that im autistic no body in my family has been diagnosed with autism so is it actually possible,post-pandemic

hi i 30f have diagnosis of adhd and gad anxiety and as adhd meds concerta work for me but make me kinda depressed in the long run well not exactly depressed they just steal my feelings eventually the classic i dont give a shit about anything i refuse to take them which is bad because my adrenaline can spike real quick and wreck havoc without them my psychiatrist prescribed me vortioxetine saying that at least it will help with the anxiety and calm me down as it acts over serotonine noradrenaline and dopamine she says it will also help me with my sound sensitivity because thats something antidepressants are useful for and that it also helps with concentration so good for the adhd i asked for elvanse vyvanse instead but she doesnt want to prescribe it to me for some reason i go to therapy which helps but not much i would like to know if vortioxetine will make me depressed or what to expect im not a depressive person and im very scared of that im very wary of meds in general but im extremely anxious and there are days where i have meltdowns and wake up in the middle of the night with my heart pounding im always like a wild animal ready to fight or flight and i cant anymore i drown in a glass of water it would be very helpful for me to know about your experiences if you tried it thank you,post-pandemic
i was 17 when i was first diagnosed with depression by my first psychiatrist shed been with me till i was 19 then the pandemic happened and they only do face to face consult i was not able to meet with them because i left the city to stay in my hometown i switched to a psychiatrist whose able to meet with me online during the first year of pandemic i got diagnosed with adhd by my present doctor i cant get my first psychiatrist out of my mind because shes been so handson with me and her other patients shed answer calls at night or even for emergencies she doesnt have a secretary shes also on their 60s so shes not tech savvy thats why she doesnt do online consult actually she is my present doctors mentor thats why im comfortable with both of them since their approaches are similar today i found out she still remembers me im now 23 my mom made an appointment for a family friend and when my mom introduced herself she remembered her and asked if i was the one wholl book an appointment i was eating when my mom told me about it i started crying not because of pain but because of joy i cried when i heard about it because shes the first ever person to understand my feelings the person who helped me take care of my mental health and helped me be where i am today im really thankful because of her im figuring out life and being able to do it on my own pace its personal since ive read somewhere that they dont really remember you but they do in my case,post-pandemic

so two years ago i got really sick and went to the hospital turns out of got a blood infection sepsis and endocridist which killed my heart valve for 3 week my wife visited me in the hospital i was told and i was pretty much dying i remember nothing really until they woke me up i think they woke me up to just see if id wake up finally the figured out my issue and replaced my heart valve 2 more weeks i got to go home 5 weeks total in ericu etc that was nearly 2 years ago today im strong healthy and mentally pretty strong i go to the gym have lots of friends and remain pretty happy but my wife suffers from ptsd our shared pcp has her in on antidepressants and told me once im not sure i can fix her with meds i have been living in a dead bed situation she understands my needs i try not to push to hard no pun but her ptsd is really getting me down i feel like she is trying to distance me because she almost lost me but its really hurtful to sort of be ignored she says it hurts im not ready it feels a bit like a new relationship where a gal might not to get involved as your not really what she wants only its my wife mother of my 3 kids we built so much traveled and did so much now its the relationship is dying and she has a bad habit of always trying to destroy any enjoyment i take in life movies with the guys why dont you take the kids i got a nice car why did you buy that used junk we have 3 kids i got a great union job we got cash no debt at all rental income like everything on paper looks amazingly good we are really really lucky but its not i know its not a logical problem i honestly feel me getting past open heart surgery is easier than living with the toll it took on her mind she over and over refuses to get see any psychologist or marriage consuling she keeps tells to get a gf for those needs which is actually really hurtful to hear i love my family and what we built and i tell her this i have actually had a psychiatric eval and guys said in 5 min hey you seem strong great normal i dint think you need meds i dont feel i do either and i saw a physiologist on my own to learn how to help her who encouraged me to set boundaries etc i think ill go she that psychologist again soon i havent been since early summer i never thought id be here in my life there was a post a few days ago that shed light on a wife wishing her husband didnt have to deal with her ptsd but in my case i am the sole reason my wife got ptsd its just really hard to deal with this when i feel i deserve to be happy esp since i almost died how do i deal with this,post-pandemic

would this approach work you make a list of medical tests for conditions you are afraid of and rank them by how much anxiety inducing they are from least to most scary then you do them one by one in order so list could look something like this 1 routine checkup 2 eye exam 3 cbc complete blood count 4 eeg 5 ecg 6 chest xray 7 abdomen ultrasound 8 tumor markers 9 brain mri 10 emg and ncs so after doing all of them you have evidence that youre not dying and you also exposed yourself to anxiety inducing situations which could lower your overall anxiety in the future what do you think could this work,post-pandemic
im 16 and 585 days ago i keep track dont have a freaky memory lol i tried to kill myself before that i would describe myself as an awful fucking human being i was extremely closeted on my gender nonbinary theythem pronouns and sexuality since most of my online friends fringed on being nazis and my best friend irl was a nazi due to me being very closeted and surrounding myself with awful people i said very awful things i knew i didnt believe but i felt i had to to keep my friends because at least i had friends and thats better than being isolated after my suicide attempt i cut off all of these people this point in my life is one where i truly felt amazing due to an extreme bpd manic episode i ended up moving out of my fathers house and now i live with my boyfriend i would say that life is better overall but i feel like life is meaningless now i feel like the only thing keeping me alive is my boyfriend and his cats every day of my life i spend on my computer spending entire days just playing elden ring on my fucking computer i wish i had more friends but i feel so awfully socially inept and it feels that in short term the lack of friends out weighs the rejection of someone not wanting to be my friend sorry if my grammar is bad or its very run on or a tangent i just needed a void to yell into,post-pandemic

i only found out about my health anxiety in my 20s but i remember displaying signs as young as 78 years old i remember having an urge to check if my heart was still beating i would physically put my hand to my chest and check my heart was still pumping and it would give me a sense of relief i couldnt enjoy myself for checking this it then progressed onto having anxiety attacks about death dying and the meaning of life i would literally be going around my normal day then have a huge anxiety attack when i got older i moved on to poking and proddinf parts of my body to check for lumps or abnormalities i would literally bruise myself because i was prodding so hard i would find a bone or a bobbly but in my body and convince myself it was a tumour and i was going to die then when i was about 1213 the first computer came into my house and i would use it to doomscroll medical websites and convince myself that my headache was a result of a brain tumour or some other severe disease i then began making countless doctors appointments about small minor things that i thought were life threatening it wasnt untill i was in my twenties that i properly discovered what all this was caused by i spoke to my doctor about it and realised that my health anxiety was probably triggered by my mother having a brain tumour and seeing her in hospital when o was only 2 i am now on anxiety medication and i am doing really well i still have the odd urge to google symptoms or get triggered by people talking about illnesses but i have learned to manage it a lot better,post-pandemic

a year ago i discovered im audhd so now theres a lot of aha moments poping up lately this is my latest aha moment and i think its a huge piece of the puzzle for me trying to understand my experience in my younger years from 1925 ish i hung out with a group of people we mostly partied together 47 guys early on they gave me the nickname fishy but i could never understand why the idea that they probably meant that i was suspicious came tonight i was always drifting around in my own world but i masked hard so theres unfortunately not a lot that i remember about the interactions in itself what i do remember though is that i didnt tell them that i had fishes at home i didnt smell fish i didnt tell them that i ate fish i didnt tell them that i liked fishing or anything other that had to do with the species fish what could be some reasons for an autistic adhder being called fishy in a social group setting,post-pandemic

my bf was sober without help starting about 10 months ago a bit before we started dating hes incredible and genuinely weve not had a single problem it feels like a fairy tale and hes very driven and emotionally intelligent and i believe honest last week he relapsed i think he was in denial before now because hed told me it was due to his drinking being problematic but that he is absolutely not an alcoholic because the issue hasnt ever been daily drinking he was drinking for a whole week before he agreed to let me get him help and call his family he then agreed to detox and treatment and has verbally committed to aa and counseling when he is out i talked to his family and so im 110 that im up to date on his use history my friends want me to dump him over this i feel like because he was able to be sober for so long before without help he likely will do much better with all of this support and ongoing help after i have told him us being together is contingent on him continuing to seek help after all this and that in the meantime i wont go anywhere i also feel that if hed had more education and support this was a preventable relapseguy just bought a house and has been very financially stressed and its his first time living alone so theres not that accountability he also was training for a double marathon and was doing long runs daily but then got hurt a month ago and all activity stopped i want to give him a shot is that crazy i need a reality check or validation here,post-pandemic

tw this turned into a selfhatred rant so dont read if youre sensitive to that stuff i literally restrict for a few days then i binge and then it just repeats i just want something anything to change i dont even care if i even gain weight right now i just need some proof that this cycle of weightmaintaining can end and i can eventually maintain through eating a normal amount each day when i start a good day i overeat because im so scared of scarcity and pure starvation again then i dont eat some days because i remember how many cookies and bread slices i had the day before i am trapped within my own head and no one would even care because they cant see it its truly all in my head went from an exhausted anorexic to a severely depressed binge eater to whatever the fuck this is hell i havent even seen the world yet im only 15 and ive already ruined everything for myself and my family i wish i was born normal and didnt have to end up with a screwed up brain i wish i could have at the bare minimum just remained anorexic so people would care about me i could be skinny and pretty but now im just fat and no one gives a fuck i honestly hope i get a stomach virus again and lose a shit ton of weight again and missing school would be the added bonus,post-pandemic
we had been talking for a few weeks after meeting in person through mutuals and hooked up on valentines day the day after i go back home i live an hour away i get asked to come back and sleep over again obviously i take up the offer and we have another amazing time just sleeping together and cuddling for the whole day and i go back home were just texting back and forth about random stuff and then queue a message that triggers me your whole persona makes you seem like a hoe excuse me just because i have a high sexdrive and im a genuine person who listens to what people say and am super engaged in conversations im such the opposite of a hoe i dont even respond to most messages on dating apps because im very selective and guarded with the people i let into my life so i screen recorded my messages on hinge to show i dont have a hoe persona that theyre accusing me of my body count is below 15 which i consider just normal for a 23 year old then i get asked if im bisexual they are too which is why they suspected i was as well and i say yes and we eventually get to the topic of how my best friend had made a sexual approaches onto me as i had awaken to them giving me oral which when i was aware of the situation immediately stopped them and told them never to do that again then i get called a red flag for having had a history of doing stuff with a bestfriend and when i tell them that it hurts to be stereotyped as a red flag something that was out of my control they back pedal and say that im not a red flag a whole but that one specific quality is a red flag i dont see how thats any different but okay i guess im really getting emotionally vulnerable at this point and as we keep talking i get asked about my sexual preferences and i divulge that i had an ex who i dated when i was 18 they were 25 wanted me to degrade them verbally and we would have very toxic hate fucks where we would try to wreck each other emotionally and physically which ended after i told the ex to go kill themselves after they said they wanted to die and its all my fault they feel suicidal i regretted this immediately after i said it and they left me saying that theyd drive off a cliff but they didnt thankfully i tell them how i felt that relationship had skewed my taste towards sadism and told them well do you think im a terrible person now red flag and they respond with no youre not the person who you were 5 years ago and that they still feel the same about me before i told them this they still like me if im being honest i was self sabotaging to hopefully make them think i wasnt worth trying to maintain a relationship with so i can prevent myself from getting hurt by rejection out of my control but instead they accepted me which emotionally threw me for a loop as now im getting mixed signals but also getting reassured i then get asked to just be cuddle buddies as they thought the sex wasnt going to work out between us as they didnt prefer my preferences i think okay wow they dont want to have sex with me anymore because they think im crazydoesnt like me as much anymore i respond the morning after with this ill be honest with you redacted name i think im way too attracted to you as a person physically to just keep things as cuddle buddies plus i dont want to force you to do stuff that you dont like and honestly i understand if we part ways here thank you for those two days and all the time we spent talking to each other i legitimately thought i wouldnt be able to find someone to have these kind of feelings but now i know its possible they jokingly respond with hahah omg are you breaking up w me and you dont wanna talk still i respond with i mean i do its just that if i keep talking to you just trying to be cuddle buddies or just talking in general its going to be bad for me since i think i actually like you which isnt good for just being cuddle buddies or just talking then they say i mean we dont have to label it just talk and see to which i begrudgingly agree too since i cant think of any valid reason to refuse but the damage has been done i dont know if its all in my head or what but i feel as if they arent considering me as a serious potential partner anymore and will just be using me as a plushie doll to cuddle with at night i feel like they no longer long for me like they did just a few days ago i stupidly messaged themi miss you and they didnt response to that but instead acknowledged every other part of the message except that do you not miss me do you not like me why are you talking to me if you dont want to have sex with me the overall responses back to my messages i feel like they have been less enthusiastic and more theyve been responding like its a chore while i feel like ive been putting in more effort what did i do wrong why am i like this i hate this feeling that makes me feel like im not in control of my emotions i dissociated all of today due to this emotional distress i skipped school because i just felt so shit and out of it and have only just now slowly started to feel like im present in my own body again i wish they had just let me go by saying that they understood my decision to leave instead of giving me hope by them saying to not label things and to see where things go were not in a relationship so i cant ask for reassurance to kind of ground me into not spiraling into these thoughts the unknown scares me so much i dont want to go through all of this to only be rejected in the end for who i really am that would be the absolute worst i hate this honestly i feel like id rather die than have keep going through something like this again i know how this is going to end with me heartbroken or me sabotaging it and i hate falling in love tldr feel like im going crazy,post-pandemic
was going through adhd videos and heard a perspective i hadnt thought about i often see on this sub adhd gets worse with age and i generally agreed cause most things get worse with age but someone said its not that their brain is getting worse its that your brain gets assaulted more often with age you gain more and more responsibilities and that means more things to procrastinate more things to forget more things to feel guilty over more tasks remain undone and thus more things pile up on you so you feel more like a failure you feel more anxiety you feel more depression it all just sorta makes sense interested in other peoples perspective on this,post-pandemic

after getting sent to voicemail for multiple days in a row and being overdue on my med refills i find out on the phone while trying to get my prescription refilled that they discharged me they cited missed appointments one of which was when i was in the psych ward last december and i had never even had a warning they claimed to have sent a warning letter but i never received it and didnt get the discharge letter until the morning after i find out over the phone that they dropped me theyre one of the worst rated offices in my town but they didnt have a waiting list when i was having a mental health emergency last year and i live in a cow college town in fucken alabama so all of the psych offices in my area are never taking in new patients the letter even said theyre available for emergencies for 30 days after the letter being sent which was on the 2nd of this month so i should still be good right but apparently refilling my meds doesnt count as an emergency i guess even though i need them to function idk i guess im just bitching but im feeling really discouraged its hard enough finding my meds in this shortage but now im cold turkey off 30mg twice a day dextroamphetamine having to navigate this shit im really upset and i already am in the middle of a mental health crisis,post-pandemic
hi everyone recently ive been reflecting on my past behaviors with my therapist is pretty chill and i brought up the idea of having bpd we went through the official mental health booklet i forgot what its called but its volume five i meet 34th of the criteria but we both agreed that my symptoms and behaviors have improved enough to really not justify getting a diagnosis but i would want it mainly to give me a label and allow me to have a community here who can maybe help understand what im going through,post-pandemic
i started wearing them when i was 12im almost 16 now because i always felt uncomfortable about the way i looked i started wearing them occasionally but as time went on they were literally the only thing i would wear no matter where i went and if i did go anywhere without wearing one id always try to avoid drawing attention to myself and start picking at my arms so does anyone else go through this too,post-pandemic
theres a huge variety of ways people with adhd behave which i think is why there are so many posts here and elsewhere on the internet about the tells or symptoms of adhd x200b the thing is there are only a handful of classic adhd symptoms that are all spelled out in the dsm and that people who get tested for it are evaluated against that doesnt mean whatever behavior youre describing is unconnected to adhd but its likely a coping strategy your way of trying to survive with adhd thats specific to who you are where you grew up and how you live these strategies can be effective and they can hold you back in other ways x200b i think of it like a sprained ankle versus a limp the sprain is pretty blackandwhite you either have it or you dont but the limp comes from adjusting the way you walk in order to avoid the pain of putting weight on the injured foot its a coping strategy some are more effective than others x200b im not trying to gatekeep or tell people not to be curious about connecting their behaviors to adhd at the same time i think theres a tendency to view adhd as this sprawling condition with no set of canonical symptoms or behaviors when i think in truth the base condition is pretty clear and most of what we experience is our response to it in nearly limitless ways x200b i hope reframing the discussion this way can help people get the clarity they need,post-pandemic

so i deal with a lot of existential questioning that gives me anxiety and one of the things ive been overthinking about lately is the fact of like how do we all have our own separate consciousness like in the sense of seeing ourselves in first pov and not seeing how we see other people yknow its like why is this me and why was i given this one like why am i not someone else its really hard to explain bc of how complex it is but idk why its gives me anxiety i try to tell myself we were all put here and we were all given our own and to just focus on me and myself and my own and to stop focusing on other peoples because theres no point in questioning it when i have my own i know this probably doesnt make any sense and i sound crazy but its really hard to explain bc of how complex philosophy is,post-pandemic

i recently was at work talking to a parent im a behavior tech and i noticed myself starting to space out but then i start trailing off talking but it felt like i couldnt control my talking as well i starting calling people by the wrong name and i think the parent started looking at me oddly and finally said something which startled me out of my state i felt very disorientated and confused after like why i acted like that when i was thinking back on that situation i realized i couldnt remember if i had vision during that brief time like if everything went black i tried to think if i was dissociating but i do feel like i felt like i was out of my body i dont recall experiencing something like this before i sometimes do have brief moments when i feel very high when im sober and i dont use any drugs besides weed occasionally but its like once a week and during those moments i feel terrified also keep in mind the day before i got some very bad news and felt triggered so im thinking anxiety has to do with it i cant help but think how scary that moment was how i feel like ptsd is yet again controlling my life,post-pandemic

i have a problem with isolating myself when splitting i feel ashamed of the thoughts i have towards the person im splitting on so consistently ill leave any groups im in with them have a sort of internal fight with myself on blocking them but settle on just deleting the number and then get mad at myself for my behavior for example today my friend and i got into a not really argument i asked if they wanted to be left alone and they said yes i respect that i understand i was being a lot but despite that i realized that after we got off call i was splitting painting them in an entirely negative light when that wasnt fair to them so i left all possible groups we were in together deleted our messages and im now just sitting in my bed mad at myself its like i was splitting on them but then turned it inward and began splitting on myself im getting off track i know its not healthy to act like this and i want to improve and get better its just difficult i self isolate all the time even when im not splitting on someone it can just be from a mood swing im currently isolating myself from my friends and support right now and had to sit here for 10 minutes convincing myself to make this post does anyone have advice or have gone through this before i dont know what to do this just hurts me and the people i isolate from and i want to stop what should i do,post-pandemic

hey everyone ive been grappling with severe anxiety and its close companion depression for as long as i can remember its a struggle thats deeply personal yet widely shared among many of us i cant claim to fully understand each of your unique journeys but i know the weight of the mental health battles we face every single day in my quest for understanding and communication ive embarked on a project that i believe could make a difference not just for me but for countless others who find it challenging to articulate their inner struggles or initiate conversations with their loved ones about their mental health im building a website that serves as a platform for anonymous letters delving into various aspects of mental healthfrom anxiety and depression to ptsd ocd and the journey of abuse recovery each letter shares the raw unfiltered experiences of individuals navigating these turbulent waters offering insight into what its truly like to live with these conditions day in and day out the idea came from my own frustration in trying to explain my experiences to my spouse despite scouring the internet i couldnt find anything that encapsulated my daily battles succinctly enough to share with her thats when it hit mei needed to create that resource myself this website isnt just about providing information its about fostering understanding and empathy its about giving voice to the silent struggles so many of us endure behind closed doors by sharing our stories anonymously we can break down barriers normalize conversations about mental health and possibly begin to heal in ways we never thought possible im still in the early stages of building this platform but my vision is expansive i want it to be a beacon of hope and solidarity for all of us a sanctuary where our stories can find resonance and our voices can be heard so im reaching out to you the reddit community to gauge your interest and gather your input is this something youd find valuable is it a venture worth pursuing im open to all feedback and suggestions if youd like to learn more or contribute your own story to the website please dont hesitate to reach out together lets shine a light on the shadows of mental health and embark on a journey of understanding and healing feel free to drop a comment or message me for further details or to share your thoughts thanks for considering this endeavor with me,post-pandemic

constant internal dialogue in my head super duper judgemental ive done a lot of work to decrease the amount of negative self talk i have and its worked extremely well i hype myself up now and am making healthier choices for me and the people around me im not cured or whatever though whenever i get upset that negative inner voice is just screaming at me mocking my healthier side for thinking that its gotten better and being delusional i just get so fucking angry at myself for still being upset or conflict averse or shutting down or dissociating and like i just want to cry so hard i feel sick sometimes yknow,post-pandemic
this is a new medication for me i dont wanna wait too long and i dont want to take it too soon around how long before i go somehwere anxiety enduring should i take one thank you also how often is too often to take it i havent been taking it every time ive needed it because of how much pressure my peers have been putting on me not to abuse it i have zero desire to take it more than needed it just doesnt sound enjoyable i do not have an addictive personality no hate or judgement to those who do though,post-pandemic
im currently on anxiety medication and i feel like i have far less episodes of the spiraling that i use to have about different symptoms of my body but the peace has grown disquieting and a little part of me is telling me that letting go of health anxiety which is my default state since i can remember i am letting go on my health and will miss important symptoms or let medical problems progress i think i have based my sanity and logic in this and now i am not sure i am interested in your take,post-pandemic
i have quiet bpd often i dont do anything that actively harms the people in my life 95 of the time i ask them for space and feel out my emotions and simply communicate a more logical response to them about why i needed space but alone i hate them i want nothing to do with them over simple occurrences that made me feel abandoned i think about leaving them ghosting them and never ever seeing them again i think about hurting myself to make them feel even a portion of what i feel im a wreck and even though they dont see or hear absolutely any of that i still feel so guilty that i could ever ever feel that about the people i love i feel so disappointed in myself,post-pandemic

so i was prescribed a test dose of azstarys about a month ago and it worked amazingly like i cant explain how well it worked it was incredible my only complaint was that it didnt last the full day i told this to my doctor and she gave me a roughly 33 higher dose after taking it for about a week i dont think its working or at least i dont feel it i still think im more focused than i was without any meds but i dont get the feeling of being sharp and dialed in like i did with the smaller dose has this happened to anyone else have i just gotten used to the feeling or is it simply not working,post-pandemic
one of the worst kinds of executive dysfunction for me are when a project is multiple steps and the first ones are new that i dont know how to do yet like i want to write an ebook and i dont know how the ebook program works yet so ive just avoided it for months bc the idea of figuring it all is too daunting even tho i know logically it cant be that hard or i know i need to check my credit score but i first need to find out which sites are reliable and the idea of sorting that out just paralyzes me things like that how do i overcome that area of ed the only way ive succeeded in the past is when there is a deadline and someone expecting me to complete it but it sucks and if those pressures arent there 95 of of the time i just cant do it,post-pandemic

i was dreading coming home for the holidays because i knew how blunt my parents would be regarding my weight ive gained 20lbs in the past year when i came home for break last winter id been at my lowest weight and was restricting below 500 my friends convinced me to tell my therapist who sent me to a nutritionist on campus and pushed me to refeed i let myself eat regularly over the summer which i didnt spend at home and kept it up into this past semester and now im relapsing hard and trying to lose weight again the first thing my dad said to me when i stepped into the house was you need to start losing weight its unhealthy to be this fat im in normal bmi range for my height by a long shot my mom comments at least once every few hours about how much fatter i look and how you dont fit into your old pants do you while eating dinner on my first day back they ordered papa johns pizza wings and said she eats so well no wonder shes gained so much weight wed just spent the whole day moving into our new house i spend my breaks working at my dads sushi restaurant which is mostly staffed by older korean adults every single damn day someone assumes they have the right to make some fucking comment about how much weight ive gained shit like i guess you just gain more and more weight each time we see you and look at her shes so chubby these days yesterday while at work i had a complete mental breakdown in public i was trying not to cry behind the host stand my dad came over to ask what was wrong and i just fucking broke down in front of him i told him how every single time anybody sees me they make comments about how fat i am and how much it fucking hurts i promised him through my tears and rage that id stop eating for fucking good if thats what everyone wanted from me one of the sushi chefs whod commented just a few minutes prior came over to apologize i didnt respond i was wiping tears away while giving takeout orders to ubereats drivers and showing customers to their seats it was fucking humiliating this is all just to say asian particularly korean culture regarding weight is so fucking toxic everyone thinks they have the right to say something that could be hurtful to anybody to me just because were friends and they dont give a fuck about mental illnesses my family members have called me fat for as long as i can fucking remember as ive always been a chubby kid they compare me to my younger sister who is 5 years younger than me hasnt fully gone through puberty yet and was blessed with amazing genes ive fucking had enough ive never felt so motivated in my life to get as sick as i possibly can when i hit my ugw and im withering away to nothing but bones and depression theyll eat their fucking words and regret everything and they wonder why i have an eating disorder edit everyone here is so damn lovely and supportive you didnt have to gild this but thank you so much and thank you to everyone whos left a comment it means so so much to me that theres a community out there for me in which i can find comfort when my family and friends turn their backs on me i hope everyone had a great holidays and is staying safe,pre-pandemic

sober from drugs sugar pornographymasturbation internet anything i have some insight from my own life to share that might help some of you i am a male in my early 20s since i was 15 i was into drugs started off with weed and it evolved from there i suppose i would have been known as a polydrug addict i have had stints with most classes of drugs including marijuana alcohol prescription amphetamines cough syrup opioids as well as some psychedelics the big one for me was marijuana like many of you i realized i had a problem this was about 25 years ago i struggled for some time trying to get sober from drugs i experience depression and anxiety which didnt make things any easier like a lot of people i want to grow i yearn for it as im sure most of you do too when i realized i had a problem with drugs i labelled it as the primary culprit of all my woes and troubles basically if i could just get sober i would magically be a better person thats all that needed to be done well this year i spent more time sober than at any point in my life prior to the age of 15 im guessing ive spent about 3 months maybe more sober this year you wanna know what i found it didnt magically turn me into a better person i was still feeling the same dissatisfaction that drove me to engage in drug use in the first place the only difference is that i was sober i spent two months this past summer sober and i spent most of those two months sitting on my computer wasting time i wasnt magically more productive my life honestly didnt change as much as i thought it would so what ive learned from this is that you cant just get sober and expect everything else to fall into place theres a very good chance youre engaging in even more negative behavior than your primary addiction and that stuff needs sorting out to getting sober is a killer start its a fuckin hard thing to do but for a lot of us you cant just stop there you have to keep going because theres a good chance you have more things to take care of along the way i know everyone is different and this post might not apply to most what ive said might be obvious to a lot of you however i spent a lot of time beating myself up over using drugs while simultaneously ignoring the other parts of my life that needed to be taken care of with that being said my hope is that someone relates to my experience and can get at least a lil something from this post safe journeys everyone and have fun,pre-pandemic
some people just get completely utterly screwed traumatized and limited by life to the point that living just isnt enjoyable anymore to the point that any wildeyed optimism one might have had in the face of adversity just gets drowned by the utter disillusionment that no sometimes even if there was a will theres wasnt much of any way and even if there still is its not worth finding ive seen people say they cant even imagine what it must feel like to want to end your life or to even be depressed on the flip side its hard for me to imagine what itd be like to not feel depression as thats been most of my life with tiny windows of joy where it felt like my efforts to outrun my horrible background were paying off those windows have closed and even if there are others left to open somewhere i dont care because they dont even look like ways out anymore im at the point someone could give me a million dollars and it wouldnt make me happy but guess what the worst thing of all is you have a survival instinct living another day feels awful but dying is still terrifying and beyond that its drummed into your head that youll hurt people if you somehow think you might be able to overcome the strongest instinct of all you dont even want to die just for your reality to be fundamentally different but thats obviously not how this all works so youre stuck in this hell thats been aptly described like the mental equivalent to a burning building and theres no grand purpose to it theres no big meaning or reward for suffering through it you just had really bad luck you just happened to be the organism born to become selfaware within an absolutely shitty situation to the point many people objectively admit you were and now youve got to either take it or leave it and both options feel pretty horrible but one at least feels like a solution in that this whole situation simply ends the thing is too i bet if it was somehow possible for a person that feels normal or god forbid happy to experience this feeling for a day theyd totally understand wanting to leave it and be incredibly grateful theyve never spent a day in the desperate void that leads one to truly consider suicide so fuck it,pre-pandemic

im autistic so im very prone to the classic autistic meltdowns i feel like my condition stops me from being happy and normal instead im viewed as very weird and obsessive people in the past have scared me enough to barely talk verbally nowadays i know if i were normal id be happy and successful no one will accept that my condition has made me a failure yet i cant talk about it to anyone about this i just end up exploding and then overdose on my sleeping meds nowhere near enough to kill me but enough to knock me out pretty fucking hard i dunno im a mess tbh,pre-pandemic
be careful i know its hard to be lonely like real hard but recently i over committed into a friendship and ended up backfiring big time especially with online you gotta be careful cos you dont know the real them edit wow i fully didnt expect this kind of response to have 250 up votes at the time of writing this is crazy so thank you this person made me feel like i was absolutely crazy and in some ways i felt it caused me to spiral into such a low place last night but obviously these people just dont care in the same way we do yes we have our struggles with over attaching and need to try control it best we can but also just like all humans our basic instincts is to love someone be it through a friendship or relationship that fulfils this within us also i personally believe social media can and often does make us feel even more lonely therefore this is likely to be my last post for a while and just try to reset myself whilst working on a better me for 2020 and beyond one day the right person will guide us out of this lonely feeling and will understand our needs in order to make us a better person however until then please never forget that only you can make you truly happy and that just because these people cant appreciate our kindness it doesnt make you any less of a person best of luck everyone thank you very much for the support today certainly makes me feel less alone xd if anyone wants to contact me then feel free to on discord my username is lfc4329836 take care,pre-pandemic

anxiety sufferers tend to have a habit of wanting one thing certainty certainty that their symptoms arent malignant when they get reassurances from their doctors you know what they need even more certainty its not their fault theyre dealing with this one thing about anxiety many people dont realize is that anxietys job is to heighten the possibility that the most devastating option is the most likely one if there is one phrase i hear constantly from people i help to help recover from anxietypanic is yeah but what if to be honest it gets me frustrated i also empathize because that phrase was part of my vocabulary when i dealt with anxiety and panic it wasnt till i found this hidden piece during my recovery that i stopped using that phrase began making leaps and strides now this hidden piece once revealed will make repulse many people on this post hang in there i promise its not what you think the missing piecewas faith and no im not referring to the faith in a higher power religious faith etc i mean faith in the most fundamental sense i mean faith in the ability to go into the unknown with the hope that everything will be okay avoidance will only make your anxiety grow and become generalized hence generalized anxiety its only when we go through the anxiety does anxiety lose its control and freedom becomes attainable once i got the knowledge of the mechanics of anxiety and understood how anxiety tricks us into thinking we have some malignant disease i made huge strides but that itself was not enough i needed to rely on the faith that everything was going to be okay in order for me to have the courage to face my anxiety and fully recover i needed to rely on something when i started doing things that made me push my comfort zones for me i had instilled faith on someone who had also suffered and recovered he wasnt a doctor he wasnt a therapistbut he understood how the mind worked more importantly this person knew how anxiety worked he saw what i was suffering with and helped me through full recovery he made me do things that i didnt feel confident in doing but i had to instill some faith in the fact that things would get better otherwise i knew for sure i wouldnt recover im saying recognize in your recoverythere will be moments you will need to have some faith regardless of what your mind is telling you relying on someone who is objective is very helpful in moments like these especially someone who has recovered also realize that this reliance on someone isnt permanent eventually this faith will be transferred into confidence in yourself which in terms will lead to a upward spiral to recovery eventually i dont like posting nuanced posts like these because i feel like it can easily be misunderstood but i couldnt help post this info because it was just so valuable in my recovery and often so neglected hope this helps,pre-pandemic
im not sure whether this is an effect of my diagnosed autism my adhdpi or my depression so im wondering if yall have the same thing going on i am not a social person at all im not shy by a wide margin im very friendly fairly charismatic understanding etc when im in social situations and i make friends easily but i dont keep those friends instead choosing to stick to myself after getting tired of the novelty of being around people this all said i would do poorly in a rural area where people arent around i cant really enjoy living in a place unless i have access to people even if i dont use that access im basically an urban hermit and i dont mind sometimes i get lonely and thats when i go out and talk to people ive never met before but those days are few and far between how many of yall have this same personality trait is this a trait common in some forms of autism or is this from something else,pre-pandemic
a year ago today at this moment i tried to take my life at this very moment 365 days ago i was in such a dark place that life seemed pointless in 9 hours a year will have passed since when i check into inpatient care it sucked i hated life i was in mental and physical pain but i kept pushing i went to iop and i was lucky enough to meet other teens who were succeeding in their path towards recovery after ten weeks of iop i graduated from the program and was on my own i started going to a adolescent sober living group and met people who instilled the idea of long term sobriety into my head it was sunshine and rainbows for six months i believe in aana they call that pink cloud around the six month mark i found out that a close friend of mine from iop was in jail a week later another one was missing a few days later one was in the hospital and finally the last kid from my original group killed himself it was just me i was the last one standing the ones i looked up to as role modes failed and i struggled but i found my passion in music again and was able to focus on people who dont struggle with substance abuse and who support me and my journey i found my way out of the first year and found that this is what i want to do with my life adolescent substance abuse counseling i am grateful for the year mark but also humbled by those i started this journey with and who arent with me now every second is a conflict every minute a fight every hour a battle and everyday a war and i will fight this for the rest of my life and i will win edit thank you guys so much for silver edit 2 wow i cant believe how much this has blown up i hope that someone read this who needed an extra push when they were struggling,pre-pandemic

today we were talking about how i have problems regulating emotions and i tend to overreact because i want people to hear me and acknowledge me personally when i have fits of rage i want to be seen and heard its like a child throwing a temper tantrum to get mommys attention she told me that its like when you and someone else are standing side by side in front of a house you start to smell smoke and you turn to the other person to tell them you think theres a fire they say no no theres no fire you then start to see the smoke and you turn to them and say no look theres definitely a fire going once again the other person says nah no there isnt you see the flames engulfing the house and once again say no cant you see the fire right there the other person blows you off once more finally you just cant take it anymore and scream look at the damn fire its right in front of you by being invalidated by other people in your life by having you express your feelings and people in your life saying that it isnt right or you shouldnt feel that way it makes you feel unacknowledged thats why the freak outs happen you just want to be heard you want validation over your thoughts and feelings idk i just through this was profound and made me look at things in a new way i thought it might help someone else so i decided to share,pre-pandemic

hey guys just wanted to share something that my therapist told me that had helped me reel in my health anxiety she described the human body as extremely noisy lots of noises sensations pains twitches etc like all anxiety disorders the brain is hypersensitive and basically catastrophically misinterprets these noises that most people just ignore or dont notice in the first place i found it helpful to try and remember in the context of someone with health anxiety that my background noise is just louder than most and to recognize various symptoms i feel as just that figured id share if that thought can help anyone reframe how they perceive whats going on in their bodies,pre-pandemic

shes this girl who works at a local tobacco shop i kind of knew she probably had a boyfriend and id get shut down she was super polite and it was all good i imagine it will be a little bit easier next time i want to do this i was embarrassed for a few minutes but it passed eventually sitting here the next day i cant believe i did that but im proud of myself just had to tell someone thanks guys edit just to add what was going through my mind at the time my psychologist has really been getting me to expose myself to uncomfortable situations especially when you know theyre going to be uncomfortable i kind of figured she had a boyfrienddidnt date customers or whatever but i considered this an experiment in allowing myself to become uncomfortable and just sitting with that feeling for a while its this kind of stuff that almost literally rewires your brain albeit small amounts over time if you keep avoiding things your brain will get used to it and thats how you end up using avoidance to deal with being uncomfortable if you expose yourself to those uncomfortable situations and allow them to run their course those feelings start to become a lot less scary over time which can help build confidence im no psychologist so that was probably a c at best explanation but hopefully it makes some sense edit 2 holy moley the amount of encouragement and props is insane you all are awesome thank you,pre-pandemic

hi i would like to propose this theory i am totally not kidding if you think about it a lot of people with autism have less social skillsless capacity to deal with emotions or pick up small non verbal cues hidden meanings etc increased cognitive capacities less emotiional attachment more rational reasoning very little aggressive most of the time dont understand why people would be mean to them etc dont we as homo genre slowly moved away from emotional and instinctual reasoning and started to use our rational minds to adapt to our surroundings why cant it be that autism is just a step foward in human evolution with our brain shutting down or modifiying the way we interact with our reptile ancient part of the brain and now moving away from our symian ancestry inbrain behaviour i am being deadly serious here i would like to hear your thoughts on the matter,pre-pandemic

borderline personality disorder isnt being cute and clingy and adorably needy being with romantic or otherwise someone with bpd isnt akin to taking care of a pet bpd isnt an aw its so endearing that they need me so badly type of thing bpd is a mental illness that is a conglomeration of several different tendencies and its not easy to diagnose you dont just decide you have it just like you dont decide youre depressed because you had a bad day or you dont decide youre bipolar because your mood changes quickly sometimes believe me you dont want it bpd is turning nothing into everything is knowing youre being irrational and not being able to stop regardless is suppressing breakdowns for fear of being abusive or of manipulating the person youre talking to into having to take care of you when they really dont want to its thinking someone doesnt care about you anymore because they made a new friend its automatically registering new people as a threat its a fear of abandonment and rejection thats damn near omnipresent its being able to shift from i love you so much to i dont give a fuck i hate you i dont even want to talk to you and back at the drop of a hat its finding identity in a drastic hair change and then feeling unsafe and desperately trying to fix it before you have to go out its seeing someone you adore and trying to emulate them because you have no idea who you are its waking up and trying to be a new person every day go vegan go goth go hipster go glamour cut your hair change your makeup gain weight lose weight and never feel quite there ever its comprehending love as pity and wanting to rip yourself apart if their tone is all too casual when your friend or love interest is returning compliments or affection its regretting saying anything about your mood and desperately trying to turn the conversation around while simultaneously needing to get it out its wanting to bleed yourself dry as opposed to cry in someones arms because at least then they dont have to clean your wounds for you they wont hate you they wont be annoyed its the constant battle every time you get upset of is this worth being sad about is it worth talking about what is more abusive talking about this or hiding it if i tell them ill bring them down and ill guilt trip them and they will resent me and it will all be my fault if i dont im a disgusting liar im manipulative im untrustworthy its wondering if youre faking your symptoms its disassociating and feeling like a ghost for days its feeling like you arent real and then wishing you werent its fear a lack of self and about a million different thoughts running through your head at all times its trying to live for the people you love as opposed to yourself its feeling suicidal and then feeling bad for feeling suicidal because whoops youre being manipulative,pre-pandemic

25 years ago i had a near death experience that landed me in a medically induced coma for 9 days i thought 10 years had gone by when i woke up and i lost 30 pounds of muscle that experiences also unlocked a lot of repressed memories for me i was sleeping at most 4 hours a night barely eating and i couldnt stand the company of others i was a horrible wreck and barely able to function 15 years after that experience i was able to start therapy i also went back to physical therapy and both of these therapists kept recommending a book to me about the impact ptsd has on us it was written by a psychologist who has been treating trauma since the early 1970s starting with vietnam war veterans moving on to specializing in treating people who have been physically or sexually abused as children it took me a long time to finally get this book i was convinced the connection i had with my body was permanently altered because of this overwhelming experience i could barely feel my left side my throat was totally numb from the tube they had down my throat even 2 years later the sheets of my bed made my skin crawl reminding me of struggling weakly to move around in the hospital bed i was too traumatized to believe relief was possible then i started reading this book maybe this wont be everyone but reading this book makes me think that what is happening to me is actually understandable its manageable its treatable and its not permanent i can feel more now things are getting better its easier for me to deescalate the tension and stress i feel on a daily basis,pre-pandemic

so my flashbacks tend to be very hard to come back to reality from sometimes im stuck in that moment and no matter how many times i say im not there im in the present 5 senses all that i still can feel stuck there one thing i started to do is like focus on something other than the event but its still in that flashback time so for example my flashbacks are related to a sexual assault rather than focusing on the action itself i try to remember what the stairs looked like we were in a basement when it happened so i try to picture the stairs and then maybe the walls another time i tried to remember what was on the tv or make up something to be on the tv so maybe youre stuck in the moment but its a little more bearable if youre not stuck on the action itself,pre-pandemic

i look at old pictures and videos of me and it breaks my heart i was so full of life even my eyes looked like they had sparkle in them i was so loud and confident and wasnt scared of anything or anyone for that matter i walked with a purpose and a sense of happiness every single day i loved waking up in the morning and i loved going to sleep knowing the next day i would be able to enjoy life again i was artistic and loved photography it was my passion and pure bliss to me i was very social and enjoyed traveling and going out i always felt things with such deep emotion wether it was good or bad and i truly feel like that is why i used to enjoy life so much my siblings loved being around me and i enjoyed their company just as much are favorite thing was to go to the beach and get pizza afterward i would find the beauty in the tiniest things that normally people would pay attention to i would laugh at everything especially with my friends they were the best friends you could ever ask for and i miss them dearly i miss always being known as the hard working person in my friend group i miss sitting outside in the middle of the night on the porch with my dog feeling the breeze and having this content feeling within myself knowing that whatever happens in the future that i would get through it my trauma has taken that ability to feel at peace in my soul and heart i hope one day my siblings wont look at me in such confusion as to why i am not the same anymore i hope one day i will be able to finish an oil painting without dissociating for long periods of time and not being able to concentrate i hope one day i am able to hang out with people without freaking out internally because they want to give me a hug i hope one day i can sit on the porch again and feel that internal peace i once felt before time heals all im hoping time can heal me,pre-pandemic
i wonder if people without ptsd have any idea of just how exhausting it can be to live with it it tires me out on a daily basis my triggers are everywhere especially when i leave my place and venture out in public being constantly set off by these things is exhausting my heart races my muscles tense i start to growl im basically thrown into fightorflight mode all the time and dont get me started on the constant anxiety that forces me to be on hyper alert for my triggers even short trips to the convenience store a couple of blocks away can run me ragged by the time i get back it drains me so fast i keep thinking that i should just lock myself away in my room hidden from the outside world but that isnt realistic especially since i started working again in december i have to face it so i do it doesnt make it any easier in fact its twisting me in a way i have very angry and violent thoughts about hurting others as a result to add to the exhaustion dealing with those intrusive thoughts is exhausting in itself then theres the worm but thats a topic for a different subreddit why am i so tired all the time well ptsd is one of the reasons why,pre-pandemic
ive always wanted to have a strong friendship with someone like i did before i started to slip into this world of bpd and mental illness but anytime im given the opportunity to make a friend i fuck it up by bailing on them ghosting them etc because im so unhappy with myself that i dont want to burden anyone else with my issues i also have ptsd from an old friendship that still bothers me to this day so it makes me even more idgaf towards maintaining a friendship i hate myself so much and i hate that i treat people in this manor i dont say rude things to people i just completely isolate myself instead and ignore everything around me i met a super sweet girl whos bipolar and like legit my twin but i cant even maintain a friendship with her because i barely have enough energy for myself and i dont know if this is me selfsabotaging i feel so bad because she wants to hangout and talk so much and all i do is ignore her like the asshole i unintentionally make myself out to be,pre-pandemic
its constantly on my mind it doesnt matter what im doing if im at work or home or outside the thoughts are always there im talking about literally every 1020 seconds i think about killing myself,pre-pandemic
this is going to be a very long post and it will include some triggers mostly from what ive been through and continue to endure ive been unemployed for the past three years nonstop all because im on the spectrum and i disclose it to prove that there is discrimination we need an army of people on the spectrum who record the interviews and get all of these ableist and discriminatory interviewers fired for discrimination for me it has sadly it has been the same with dating ive been single my entire life yet ive dated multiple girls as soon as i told each of them that im on the spectrum and that i live in a group home because of discrimination they immediately rejected me and dumped me the latest girl that i dated i hid the fact that i had autism from her and we were classmates in the same class together on the fourth date she assumed immediately that i had autism and when i asked her what made her think that she told me that her brother was an aspie as well and she told me that she wanted to work with people on the spectrum i explained to her that i had autism and how my parents punished me for standing up for my rights by sending me to a group home with 24 hr supervision and i also explained that im about to graduate community college and transfer to an outofstate school if my ableist parents who are my legal guardians let me go i also told her that i was anxious about telling her because three girls in a row rejected me when they found out that i was on the spectrum the date ended very well and while we were officially a couple i always thought in the back of my mind that if she found out about my autism she would break up with me immediately because usually when im pessimistic about something im usually right as i was leaving i started making a video just a couple blocks away from my house predicting that she would break up with me via text message not even a few seconds later did she text me saying that she was breaking up with me because i did not tell her that i had autism that she was hurt that i assumed that she would discriminate against me like the others anyway we exchanged some pretty choice words to each other and i saved my text messages to hopefully prove to others what kind of person she really is and the kind of stuff i usually go through later when i went back to class the few friends that i had there all told me that they didnt want to be my friend anymore because i was disrespectful to their friend who was my now my ex after i showed them the texts that she sent me it proved to them that i was right and that she really was discriminating against me by telling me that she was breaking up with me because i didnt tell her that i had autism because i was afraid of how she would react if she found out anyway after that incident she lost the respect of the entire class and i felt good knowing that for once in my life justice was finally served this is exactly why i hate going to my family for dinner whenever i visit my family its a nightmare for me and because im jewish and every time i visit them for sabbath they always body shame and disability shame me and they do it even more so when i criticize them for discriminating against me they would use hypocritical language like dont use your disability as a crutch yet when they discriminate against me for having autism they would tell me that you call yourself smart yet its taking you five years to graduate community college and when i tell them its because of my disability they would tell me again dont use your disability as a crutch its because youre lazy just a week ago in the last week of may i started recording my abusive family and how they were treating me because i wanted to prove to people that my family are not the good angels that they are made out to be and they have and entire dish different script for me in private in fact the real reason im single and unemployed is because of all the discrimination ive been going through and also i am single and friendless and a virgin because of this discrimination as unfortunately most girls in my area just like the rest of the conservative and disability shaming bukharian community have all rejected me when they found out that i have a disability in my community people with disabilities are publicly shunned and shamed i openly criticized my community with a very backward practice of shaming people who are different because of that ive been shamed even more than others and this is why am probably going to be single and lonely for the rest of my life and the same thing with jobs in my area as well perhaps im just meant to be single and unemployed for the rest of my life i dont know what i did in my past life to deserve all this bad luck but i hope my luck will change eventually also ive also been dumped because of my negativity as well thats on me ill admit but the root cause of my negativity is all the discrimination that ive faced and continue to face i want to have a family and have kids and send them off to college but how my ever going to achieve that if im constantly being rejected for having a disability and for expressing myself we need to stand up for one another and give a check for support because no one wants to help us unless we help ourselves first we need to be warriors in the fight against discrimination ableism and discrimination mostly because of autism discrimination over 80 of autistic college graduates are unemployed and the suicide rate among people with autism is the highest of any group in this country disabled or otherwise mostly because of discrimination and unemployment as a result of the discrimination i am an organizer for the autism self advocacy network in new york city and im leading a grassroots effort in new york so people with autism and other disabilities can stand up for themselves and others like them,pre-pandemic

one way i have been coping with my adhd is by looking at my genetic make up from an evolutionary approach yes reddit evolution i think reddit likes evolution thom hartmann proposes the huntergather hypothesis in which i ascribe too i am still learning more about this theory but i enjoy it majority if not all humans were once huntergathers food was obtained from hunting as well as farming so you had the farmers and the hunters now if you have adhd and you were transplanted back in time what job would you choose my money is on the hunter the racing mind looking for the next big kill chances are i have retained some of these characteristics from my ancestors as society evolved these adhd characteristics did not always fit it i agree with this view as to why adhders do not like the mundane and cant stay focused on the boring however can hyper focus on the interesting and stimulating i think this also explains adhders and their distorted sense of time impatience and impulsiveness this outlook has helped me a great deal hopefully it can help you too i am not a great writer and aware i may have made some grammatical mistakes,pre-pandemic
i feel like when people talk about having bipolar parents or exs theyre like you never knew how they would act and other stereotypes is this just because of dumb stereotypes from movies and stuff or is this typical im bp2 so obviously my symptoms are less severe but i feel like when im hypomanic its more of an internal feeling like i feel rushed and energized and optimistic and motivated and on the outside i might seem really productive but i dont think it would seem like somethings outwardly wrong if you just looked at me i feel like my interactions with people were relatively normal i talked a lot but i dont think a normal person would think of that as overly weird or anything my close friends will bring it up to me if it seems like im partying too much or making weird decisions but besides that i dont think people notice and when im depressed i isolate myself and might seem a little sad or something but in public its easy to fake not being depressed in either state i never lash out at people and hardly ever seem outwardly upsetn or agitated my personality doesnt change is this how bp2 generally presents is this how all bipolar besides like psychotic mania generally presents or is the stereotype of not knowing how a bipolar person will react to stuff real,pre-pandemic
theres nothing in my life worth living for anymore everything and everyone who brought any join into my life is gone im disabled in poor health i suffer abuse on a daily basis and i feel totally alone in this world it would be a relief to be able to just stop existing the only thing preventing me is the fact that i have 1 or 2 family members who i feel would be deeply affected if i were to check out on them so i suffer through each day more alone then the last in order to spare their feelings anyone else in a similar situation,pre-pandemic

to explain i used to live in a decent sized city and i found backroads in the country that takes me on a nice drive away from all of the light pollution and its nice to just be away from people and enjoy the country anytime i was feeling down or negative i would just hop in my car and go the drive took about an hour and it was really peaceful by the time i got home i was usually in a much better headspace i just really loved that drive when explaining the drive to a girl i was really into at the time she was talking about how its impossible to remember that drive and every turn because there are many i have driven on those roads enough to remember exactly when to take each turn i proceeded to go over every turn about halfway through is when i began to overthink everything does she actually give a shit about this you look stupid just stop the usual i then stopped halfway through everything gave like a half smile and said that i had forgot this is just something that always goes through my head there are probably better explanations on this but this is the first one that came to mind thanks for letting me vent guys,pre-pandemic
hey dear people of the interwebs the last time i have a pretty contradictive frame of mind i am craving closeness a lot this wanting is so hard i think a lot of you on this sub can relate on that i make myself not heard because i fear to push people away when talking about my issues i am slowly learning to get heard now to the issue for me i crave a romantic relationship or someone who is there for me but on the other hand there is this protective inner voice that says i should rather stay alone and be okay than to be happy and having someone that leaves me and i am alone and destroyed so my mind tells me i should stay alone and to be okay but on the other hand i deeply crave that closeness has anyone experienced that i am currently 24 and i think that might be one of those mid twenties issues have nice week people,pre-pandemic

ive been seeing a psychiatrist and have been on every antidepressant and antianxiety medication for 4 years since being committed after a suicide attempt i wasted all those years still being miserable i finally fired him and tapered off all my meds i felt free like i broke up with a controlling boyfriend i knew i needed to work on the core of why im so miserable lots of trauma so i scheduled an appointment with a well regarded trauma therapist she spent the whole appointment covering herself she said i was passively suicidal i said i have no intention of hurting myself again but see no meaning in life she said i needed to be stabilized she sort of threatened she might need to commit me which was a very traumatic experience for me and said shed need to discuss my history with my old psychiatrist and she probably wouldnt be able to work with me unless i was at least on antidepressants again she forced me to sign the release form to get on the books for another appointment i left feeling really pissed off drove home wrote her an email explaining what a disappointment it was revoked her rights to discuss anything with my old psychiatrist and cancelled my next appointment im just venting all i wanted was someone who could to talk with me and help me that way most of my trauma is centered around horrible medical care so its a big deal for me to reach out for help only to be screwed over again,pre-pandemic

cw suicide some sexual content my name is james and i am 40 in my late 20s when i first started making enough money to bring home bottles of liquor to build a liquor cabinet i started noticing that i wouldnt make it through an evening movie without having five six drinks i remember my first real hangover i was 28 my friend thomas and i went to a restaurant i had been drinking the night before and i told myself i wouldnt drink that night he persuaded me to split a bottle of wine we did and we merrily went back to my house he had a couple of friends come over we started drunkenly playing the piano it was fun one of his friends was kind of notworldly she asked if i wanted another drink and i said yes she filled a rocks glass to the brim with tequila and handed it to me i drank it in five minutes i couldnt taste that it was straight alcohol i stood up and fell over i stood up and fell over i fell into the bathroom i fell into the tub i fell out of the bathroom i told the roomful of people i had to go to bed i do not remember the next day except that i was crying for most of it i stopped having booze in the house my drinking was daily but under control at 37 i started dating a wonderful man he was younger than me taller than me smarter than me and he adored me he wanted us to move in together get a dog together i told him that i wanted to wait a few days before our first year anniversary he told me i was the love of his life he told me he wanted to spend the rest of his life with me i called my mom the next day i told her he was the one i told her i wanted to buy us a dog my mom and i bought a beautiful dog her name is charlie my boyfriend was overjoyed at 39 we found a perfect house to live in in the city but in a quiet part on the outskirts of downtown there was a backyard and a basement we had a housewarming and i felt truly happy i do freelance work and i lost my biggest client a few days after we moved in i became depressed i spent a week in bed i had joined a different kind of gym one close to the new place that has classes i bought a membership i found myself unable to go i was too depressed my boyfriend wanted to have a liquor cabinet i spent the first two months feeling terrible i thought it was about the loss of my client no i was drinking a lot and i didnt even really realize it i was emptying the bottles one by one and replacing them every week i started to put on a little weight and lose muscle i have always been skinny and fit but i started to get a paunch my depression got worse i started sending angry messages to people who i was mad at usually late at night or first thing in the morning id post impulsive things on social media a friend who id sent an angry message to wrote on social media that i was an abusive person posted it on facebook screenshotted my message to her i spiralled out it was 6am and i sent a suicide note and picked up a knife from the drawer i sharpened it and started walking down to the lake i was going to slit my wrists and get in the water to bleed out as i was walking down the friend emailed me and begged me to live and apologized i started crying i walked around the city by myself when i came home i lay in bed with my stillsleeping boyfriend i told him i loved him the police had been called by one of the recipients of my suicide note they took me to the hospital and confined me they released me a couple days later i started seeing a therapist who was helping me deal with my issues i put a lot of stock in the opinions of others and can feel crushed when somebody doesnt like me or seems to respect me i downplayed my drinking to my therapist my boyfriend had always been sexually compulsive in our relationship he had assured me that he loved our sex life but that he liked sleeping around we had rules but he tended to break them or just behave in insensitive ways his compulsive behaviour increased i would see him surfing grindr every morning as i made breakfast he slept with a man once when he was annoyed that id gone to see a movie with a friend he didnt like he was constantly sexting people his exlover including two of my own friends i snooped on his phone and was angry about the extent of his sexual activity the sexting i saw that he was speaking poorly about my sexual performance to a group chat with his friends in it i saw that he was speaking about how much he missed his exlover to his friends after i told him id snooped and i was hurt he told his friends id snooped they told him that trust was no longer present in our relationship they started telling him to leave me his compulsion increased as did my drinking when he worked late i would have five to eight 25oz drinks before he got home i would smoke a little weed before he got back and pretend i was really high when he wasnt working late and was home i hid a bottle of tequila on the back porch i would step out for a cigarette and take swigs from the bottle without him knowing one night i made dinner and had a plate made for him i thought hed be getting home around 8 but he didnt get home until midnight he decided to hook up with somebody on his way home around 11 i was wasted i was trying to put his plate of food in a warm oven in and out so the fish didnt dry out i spilled quinoa all over the oven i was too drunk and the oven was too hot i turned the oven on self clean i passed out in bed my boyfriend came home and i was passed out and there was smoke pouring out of the kitchen i kept telling myself i needed to stop my drinking became like a ritual my last drink i would tell myself and toast to myself i would have a second and a third each one feeling like my last i would have my sixth and say to myself im so happy that as of tomorrow im a nondrinker this would happen every night i was losing days of work to my hangovers my boyfriend and i were fighting more i was in worse shape than id ever been we went to the beach and he took a photo of me my gut was visible and unattractive and he commented maybe not the best angle i woke up the next morning hungover crying and said i feel fat he was unsympathetic our sex life became strange hed initiated our morning activity by putting my hand on him i am the more active lover but he started being unappreciative the last time i performed oral sex on him i asked him how it was and he just said im late for work and got up and got dressed i went out again with my friend that he doesnt like we were drinking at the bar i came home and my boyfriend picked a fight with me he started yelling at me about how he respects me less for hanging out with this particular friend he called my friend a shithead he went on his group chat and posted a long story about how shitty my friend was and how he respected me less for hanging out with him i told him that his behaviour tracked as abusive youre not supposed to isolate your partner from his friends he went on his group chat and told them that i accused him of being an abuser i had done no such thing i just asked him to stop picking on my friend he yelled at me i will never stop shittalking him we resolved the fight a few days later he apologized for what he did he said he had his own requests he told me i needed to secure a new client he told me i could no longer be depressed i had to get out of it he said finally you really need to up your sex game i called my mom the next morning and said i thought we were going to break up his birthday was a few days later i was anxious about being around his social circle they all had been hearing that i was a terrible person in group chat they were warm but distant i started hearing snippets of conversation and thinking they were talking about me they told me about a plan to sing karaoke the next weekend they implied that i was invited i am great at karaoke and they always invite me even when my boyfriend isnt available i didnt drink at dinner but when i got home i snuck a few drinks in before bed that weekend i wasnt invited to karaoke i was depressed and i stayed home by myself and drank i didnt reach out and ask if i could come i made up my mind to break up with my boyfriend it was clear he wasnt happy his sexual compulsion suggested that something was up his dismissiveness toward my sexual performance suggested hed lost his attraction toward me he came home and i told him i didnt like the way he talked about me in group chat i told him i didnt like the way he talked about my friends i told him he could be casually cruel to me i told him i wanted to break up he said he had wanted to break up for a while we went to bed and it was ok the next day while he was at work i snooped on his computer again he had already joined tinder and changed his grindr status to newly single he was making plans to visit his exlover he had made a plan to fly to chicago so sleep with a man he had a crush on over instagram i became depressed and i started drinking a lot he moved out a few days later without him in the house i was drinking constantly one night feeling belittled and sad i got blackout drunk i was smoking on the patio passed out and i suddenly regained consciousness i had fallen over the railing my head was on the stone below my leg caught in the railing i went inside i didnt realize but id given myself whiplash and a concussion i went on twitter and started posting i posted that my dick was fine and i couldnt believe my boyfriend didnt think so i posted that he was a size queen i posted that his friends didnt know how terrible hed been to me i posted a photo of my dick and said look this is what he says is not good enough my boyfriend came over in a rush he saw that my head was bleeding and put rubbing alcohol on it he stayed the night i cried in bed the next morning i told him i didnt want him to leave he texted me that night that he missed me he told me he loved me he told me he was sorry he drove me away with his sexual activity and belittlement i spoke to him the next day he said he hadnt meant what he had texted that i was exhausting and he wanted a break he did want to break up i was devastated every night i still was getting blackout drunk last night i started looking around the house for some means to kill myself i was going to hang myself with the dog leash i was going to cut my wrists in the tub at 1am i called my boyfriend instead i told him that i was an alcoholic and i needed treatment i told him that he needed therapy for his sex addiction i told him our relationship was too good too loving to give up so easily i told him that i loved him i told him that he had told me once that i was one of the best lovers hed ever had i told him that a good sexual relationship requires work from both partners i reminded him that hed told me i was the love of his life and he wanted to spend the rest of his life with me i barely remember the conversation i was so drunk this morning i was crying and hungover i called my mom and told her i was an alcoholic i called my boss and told him the same and that i needed help he agreed to be part of my support group i called my friend jeff who is in aa and had previously told me it had changed

like many on here i have been utterly convinced that death was rapping on my door ready to whisk my into that gentle night and every time i go to answer its just another version of myself standing dumbly at the other side of the door wearing a hood and cloak i have had every symptom under the sun and yet despite what dr google tells me i am still in near perfect health what is the biggest and realest detriment to my health anxiety it plagues my mind and has me pissing every 5 minutes in the night thinking i have diabetes or kidney failure im actually just so dehydrated from fear that i gulp buckets of water every night hell just a moment ago i had somehow convinced myself that i have skin cancer because my hand was itchy why was it itchy because every damn time i take a piss from the waterfall i consume i wash and scrub my hands now i am no longer itchy because i chilled out some and used logic to slay that fear i have a fluttering on the left side of my body has to be some wicked mediaeval disease that wants to make me its playground right no its just the tummy rumbles that only ever appear when i am anxious wait do i have more moles than before yeah must be dying any day now just waiting for that cancer yknow just wake me up when it starts to get interesting ah but this persistent uncomfortable leg feeling is deep vein thrombosis but of course i sit too much so when will it shoot up and annihilate my brain probably fucking never actually i am very much alive very much in good health and besides a very overactive imagination and a love for horror i am just another normal human being who occasionally finds themself short of breath amongst millions of others doing normal human things what i have come to learn is that these symptoms arent ones of imminent death but rather ones of life feel your heart beating weirdly guess what your heart is beating it changing its pace or pattern is just what it does stop judging it so hard man is your arm numb well shit it might just be a normal human arm sorry for the prognosis in case you were hoping that you were another species if you feel anything at all it is a symptom of life if its uncomfortable then perhaps you shouldnt drink 3 cups of coffee tomorrow aye or maybe your bedtime was basically yesterday you dont need reassurance you need the sort of logic that experience gives you if youve survived 5 false signs already then the 6th one is very likely to be nothing but the boy who cried wolf was right eventually yeah but youre on wolf watch in the fuckin city and youre not just crying wolf but also lion and gator at the slightest flashes of yellow and green its just a traffic light go back to bed chill out you havent died since you began reading all of this have you maybe a few braincells but thats just the gilsworth charm so im here to remind you that you are okay youre good youre golden and even if you werent then the fact of the matter is that we live in an unprecedented time of medical wonder you are here because you know you worry not because you know you have cancer iz all gud capiche,pre-pandemic

for any health professionals who have a mental health condition perhaps you can relate commiserate a few months ago i started to suspect i had bipolar ii i was going through a particularly rough patch in my personal life and the depressive and hypomanic episodes were becoming obvious i was struggling and decided to confide in a friendcolleague without saying a word to me about it this colleague decided to report me to my boss she had health concerns relating to the issues i was having in my private life not my work next thing i know my boss calls me into a meeting wont tell me what has been said about me colleagues confidentiality is important but wants to ensure i am seeking treatment for these health concerns i am ive been seeing a psychologist for years am on antidepressants and ive been trying to seek support from friends i feel pretty shattered by this exposure vulnerability at work i seek a voluntary hospital admission to keep myself safe and hopefully to be reviewed and started on mood stabilizers nurses and doctors in the hospital didnt want to consider bipolar because starting meds is something that should be done as an outpatient apparently they ignore what im telling them and label me with borderline instead after hospital i managed to find a psychiatrist get properly diagnosed and medicated things started looking up i was stable healthy picking up the pieces three months later i get a call from the psychology board that colleague had not only made my diagnosis public at work but had also reported me to the psychology board so theyre now going to conduct an investigation into my mental health the case worker tells me that they cant tell me what has been said again colleagues confidentiality is important but they need indepth letters from all my treating physicians outlining things like my familydevelopmental history etc so that they can decide whether im a risk to the public oh and they are currently looking through all my medical records they apparently dont need my consent they will simply access my hospital records and sift through every sensitive personal issue i have ever divulged during treatment thinking this would be confidential while scrutinizing whether i can continue my career in case im not being completely honest in my statement this news has an awesome effect on my mental health and now i continue to wait on the outcome of their investigation wondering what strangers on the board are going to learn intimate details about my complex trauma history wondering how my income and livelihood is going to be affected i feel like the lesson out of all this is that as a psychologist im not allowed to have a mental health condition or if i do i need to keep it to myself so that im not publicly exposed judged punished i feel like i dont have supports or therapists any more yeah ill turn up to sessions because i have to but how can i be anything other than good now i dont have a right to privacy how disappointing to be treated so harshly by the very profession ive dedicated almost a decade of training to being treated like a threat to public safety rather than somebody whos going through something seeking support feeling shellshocked,pre-pandemic

i had already taken another pill earlier but for some reason it wore off much earlier than usual and i still have a lot of work to do so i just decided to take another one i usually take it in the morning and it always wears off in time for me to sleep but this time i dont know what to expect tldr took 30 mg vyvanse at 6pm should i try and sleep tonight or just pull an all nighter studying edit to be completely honest i am not really feeling any of the effects of the medication right now at 8pm besides the fact that my legs are sort of jittery which is a symptom that i always have even well after the medication is done working this sucks though because i wasted a pill expecting to be able to study all night and i still dont have the motivation to start my test isnt until wednesday but i just wanted to finish one work sheet we were assigned but i just dont feel like its worth it for me to even try to do it if my vyvanse isnt working because it will probably work tomorrow and then i will be able to do the worksheet and be super interested in it and motivated,pre-pandemic

hi yall i dont know if this has been posted here before but i just came across by far the most comprehensive list of the physical symptoms of anxiety ive ever found you can find it at this link and then scroll down the page anchor links dont seem to be working right for me but just scroll and youll find the symptoms this apparently lists 241 unique symptoms of anxiety the next time youre thinking could anxiety really be causing this look here chances are yes my favorite thing about this is the quote from the very bottom of the page anxiety really can seem to cause almost every symptom imaginable because it does it mimics health conditions it can make you so sensitive to how you feel that normal perceptions feel abnormal it can create its own issues such as causing acid reflux which then causes hoarseness or chronic cough in nearly any mental health book the list of anxiety symptoms is extremely small and this leads to people developing even more anxiety as they worry that they may have something else that something else may be wrong with them but if you talk to people that have anxiety do research and learn more about the condition you will quickly find that there are hundreds of anxiety symptoms out there hope this helps someone out there edit i know this could possibly be construed as reinforcement for some folks but for me its a good firstdestination when i would google symptoms instead im going to bookmark this click on it find my symptom here and avoid the terrors of dr google,pre-pandemic

to determine whether i had asd i was given a neuropsychological exam needless to say i was diagnosed with it part of this exam included the waisiv iq test and the wiatiii test of academic achievement i scored in about the 50th percentile on both so average both tests however measure different skills and give individual scores based on each one the overall is all of them averaged out the discrepancies in these scores were remarkable i always knew that i was unusually crappy at a lot of things but at the same time very talented in others but this proved it in the verbal comprehension and written expression sections i was in the 99th percentile in some other sections such as mathrelated stuff working memory and processing speed i was borderline intellectually impaired i know thats the opposite of how the people in movies with savant syndrome operate they are supposed to be able to do dizzying calculations in their heads while at the same time having difficulty with language one possible reason for that is that i have also been diagnosed with nonverbal learning disorder which is incredibly similar to aspergershigh functioning asd it is characterized by typical symptoms of either as well as difficulty with math visualanalytic skills and motor skills contrasted with superior verbal skills most people who have it also have deficiencies in complex reading comprehension but are exceedingly good at things such as spelling and word recognition i must also note that my difficulties in math are less about mathematical reasoning and more about arithmetic i am a total boss at logic puzzles but numbers screw me up i do think that my case is more extreme than most cases of nld my english language skills are impressive even by neurotypical standards i learned how to read when i was three or so and by the time i was in first grade i was reading at a seventh or eight grade level i had the highest reading level in the school and it went all the way up to fifth grade i took the act in seventh grade and while my overall score was only 21 i was in the 93rd percentile for englishreading i believe i was in the 10th for math it was similar for the sat which i took in eighth grade although i may have been in the 98th by the time i took the act again as a junior i was in the 99th for englishreading and i got all the way up to the 13th for math hooray in high school i tested out of the english class that was impossible to test out of after reading 5 out of 7 of the required books in the span of a week i did well even though i had only read the cliffs notes for two of them i then proceeded to get an a in the lit class that nobody gets an a in i was often considered to be either one of the best or the best writer in my ap lit class despite the fact that most of the other students in my class had 40 or higher averages and i was scooting by with about a 23 my senior year sorry if it sounds like im bragging im really not trying to im proud of my english skills but i honestly suck at a lot of things that one needs to decent at to function properly i sometimes feel like im half genius half idiot its really frustrating sometimes tldr i have insanely good english skills but i am borderline intellectually impaired in other areas i think i might have savant syndrome edit ah yes there were a few dodgy commas and such in my post you are all very smart i suppose the label is unnecessary anyway i just was researching the idea and got excited i tend to do that a lot,pre-pandemic
so im going to flunk out of college its alright im in the final stage of grief about it acceptance so i dont need your kind words although thank you kindly if do you post something caring my kind the workingclass dont belong in university anyway its our lot in life to fix the ferraris grow the champagne grapes and erect the mansions of those who do go to college i accept its my fault i failed i just cant stay sitting still reading books for hours on end my body wants to be out in nature and my hands have to be doing something exploring creating and building things thats what i was born for not memorizing rote but theres one thing i felt was unfair using adderall ritalin and other adhd meds to get ahead was an open secret at my university even though in my country new zealand its a controlled substance and illegal to possess without a prescription the college authorities turned a blind eye to it the lab tutors phd students postdocs boasted about popping it whenever they needed a journal paper to write right before deadline and one told us to thank adderall not his supervisor for him getting his phd incredible focus unflagging energy amazing powers of recall and connectionforming in the mind everyone knew thats what adderall would give you and for the right price there were people on campus that would supply you you should have seen the place around cram time exams you could see the medicine bottles in the bins and the people taking their pills when they sat down in the library i dont know if i would have got my degree if i had partaken but i didnt people were selling sure but i wasnt rich enough and im now failing my courses it probably is because im neither smart nor dedicated enough for university id rather get lost in my cups than lost in a book but still how is it fair how is it ethical how is it responsible that universities basically encourage performanceenhancing drugs in the form of adderall abuse,pre-pandemic

its the most frustrating thing in the world you tell someone about what symptoms your experiencing and they laugh it off or call you a hypochondriac yeah buddy i fucking know that i often ask people instead of google about whats wrong with me because id get better reassurance off of them but its always the same ignorance i wish everybody that didnt have health anxiety would understand how mentally draining it is and how real the physics manifestations can be my parents took it upon themselves to not allow me to go to therapy due to me being silly and it being something i have to get over and fix myself ive had this anxiety for over two months now and im currently on holidays this weeks special vertigo headaches and weakness i hate this so much i just wish i had someone to talk to that understands,pre-pandemic

first time redditor long time sufferer x200b x200b the title says it all ive been struggling with hypochondria and gad for years but have had a particularly bad couple months recently like so many of you my anxiety produces so many random and unusual symptoms and every time i feel something new or unusual im left compulsively reading every medical publication on what it could potentially mean and then relentlessly calling all my friends who are in the medical field seeking reassurance that i am not on deaths doorstep x200b x200b but then i stumbled upon this community x200b x200b reading all of your posts has truly helped me start challenging my ohsocorrupted thought process youve helped me acknowledge just how complex a monster anxiety is and how many symptoms with supposedly nothing but ominous causes can indeed be attributed to anxiety x200b x200b but the most important posts in this entire subreddit are the ones talking about reassurance and how it is comparable to a drug nothing could be a more accurate description of how addicted and dependent ive become on hearing the words everything seems fine it seems to be a common theme among the success stories in this community that breaking ties with google and incessant doctors appointments are the first steps to recovery well im happy to say that today i took that first step when i woke up this morning i promised myself that every time i felt a pain or something unpleasant and that massive urge to open up webmd started to come on i was going to turn off my phone and walk away from it it was not easy at all every minute that went by that i didnt do research i felt like doom was closing in on me for hours the anxiety worsened until i was on the verge of having full blown panic attacks x200b but then things started slowing down i realized my original symptoms that were triggering me had subsidedand in time my fight or flight response had mostly stood down as im typing this i still am very much on edge and am still feeling that crippling impulse and i know i still have a long road ahead of me but this was a big victory for me a big first step x200b x200b thank you for taking the time to read i look forward to getting to know all of you and offering up what support i can,pre-pandemic

i wanted to share a different approach that helped me a lot in previous years and when i was at the peak of my health anxiety my anxiety was always about my heart palpitations is it ok am i dying to the point where i would overanalyse everysinglething i felt every twitch every weird sensation every pain every little thing that my body did basically i went to counselling for it and there i learned a new way to look at it and i wanted to share it and maybe it will help someone else as well x200b imagine a machine that scans your body it could be like a light scanner inside of you that just scans your whole body all the time people with health anxiety people like me in stressful situations turn this scanner on usually because their life feels so overwhelming that they just need something to control and they feel like if they can at least control their own body and make sure its always at 100 things will get better thats how i felt at least now this scanner once its on it starts scanning all the time it scans from head to toe it scans while you eat while you drive while you walk and it scans in the back of your mind and then it happens x200b youre walking down the street and you get a palpitation you move your eyes too quickly and you feel dizzy for a moment your neck feels tight out of nowhere a sharp sudden pain comes and goes in a moment out of nowhere you name it something small something that passes in a second or two something that this scanner is looking for x200b and oh my god does it send an alarm of course it does the scanner is literally waiting for something even remotely out of the ordinary the tiniest of things to happen and it sends an alarm to the whole body suddenly youre in panic what was that palpitation am i dying why am i dizzy am i gonna faint etc the panic passes and so does the symptom that caused it and now youre absolutely afraid of getting the same symptom again because you connect it to panic and if youre like me you connect it to the thing you were doing when it happened in my case palpitations happened after ive eaten and it nearly created an eating disorder because i refused to eat anything more than a sandwich for months i was afraid of eating because my brain was connecting the panic with food i was afraid of food x200b so moving on panic is done youre calm but the scanner the scanner has done a good job in your brain the scanner has done a fantastic job at alarming you that something happened so it keeps going in the background of your mind looking waiting for something even remotely out of the ordinary to happen and sometimes if a whole day passes and this scanner is going on in the background youll feel tense af almost like youve waited a whole day for something bad to happen to you and that feeling alone can trigger symptoms so hey more work for that damn scanner x200b now every person has a scanner however in people with health anxiety that scanner is suuupeeer sensitive an ordinary persons scanner would send an alarm when theres something genuinely wrong with you something you need checked asap but it wont send alarms for the day to day little things like heart skipping a single bit small pain in your chest etc etc x200b so my way of dealing with it was once i realised that this was all that it was i had a hyper sensitive health anxiety scanner in me haha and its turned on most of the time because of my health anxiety so next time i get a weird sensation and my first thought is shit im dying i just follow it with nah girl thats the scanners alarm and just recognising it as what it is just a false alarm helps calm me down and not go into full panic mode over something small and remember if it truly is dangerous to you the alarm will not stop for hours sometimes days and it will be more like bring your attention to this symptom its been happening in a while it could mean something you should check it out and not oh my god this is it im dying this is the end my heart is failing i cant breathe learn to recognise the difference in your own body x200b so yeah thats it it helped me cope and i hope it helps you as well remember a hyper sensitive scanner will slowly turn into sensitive scanner and at the end youll be just like everyone around you with no health anxiety its just until then remember that youll be fine and your body can indeed send false alarms because youre fixated on your health so much it thinks its necessary to let you know about anything and everything thats happening inside of you your heart is just having a hiccup and like every other muscle in your body sometimes it twitches for no reason your head is just a bit dizzy but think of all the times that youve been so happy or so excited about something that you also felt dizzy and you were still completely fine you got this youll be okay keep going 3 edit thank you so much for the 2 gold im glad this post has helped people and calmed them down even a bit,pre-pandemic
im so overwhelmed last week the flashbacks were so bad the night before my shift im a server that i was awake all night and i wasnt able to call in needless to say i was not in a good head space of course that one day in particular was absolutely crazy at the restaurant and i was struggling to keep up my coworker asked me why i was so overwhelmed and said that i should have been handling this better so i not wanting to divulge my whole mental health history just joked that i must have partied too hard last night i thought i made it clear that i was kidding but i guess not because she started spreading it around that i wasnt able to perform my job and that i was falling apart when my supervisor came to talk to me i broke down crying and explained what happened now the coworker is accusing me of lying and i heard her and some other girls talking about how im incompetent at my job i cant do this anymore i understand making a hangover joke was probably in poor taste but considering were all college kids i thought it would go better than explaining the real reason just feel super demoralized and i hate myself for it why did i have to fall apart at work,pre-pandemic

ive been curious if anyone else has experienced this and i would like to get feedback from not just nature lovers but those who arent so bothered about nature either so also if you arent really a nature lover if you have been in places like forestswoodlands or very wildnatural picturesque areas have you nevertheless found any kind of healing or extreme calm simply by being in that environment i tend to feel this strongly myself though i know that i am a nature lover so im curious if its just simply connected with my love of nature or whether it could be a universally healing thing independent of being a nature lover or not i suppose that because i have a lot of social anxiety the remote nature of a lot of wildnature environments give me a strong sense of peace and calm eventhough it is still outside and public and its very refreshing like a reset button in some ways im definitely not a new age type hippy person but i find it profoundly uplifting and calming i know that some people have investigated what some have termed forest therapy or forest bathing it would be very interesting if one day someone does more in depth and comprehensive research and study into this thanks,pre-pandemic

hi ive struggled with this on and off since i was a young teen i grew up in the suburbs with immigrant parents and one older sibling who was always out with huge groups of friends or gfs and never home my parents never ever went out socializing felt like a burden to them didnt have too many friends couldnt spend too much money holidays were just another day at home never anything special it wasnt until the last decade now that all kids are grown and theyre retired that they started traveling the world and taking up hobbies and making friends when i was a kid and i complained about feeling cooped up at home they couldnt relate to my anxiety i always felt like my close friends always had other groups of friends or huge families where there was never a weekend or day theyd be home moping always had groups of friends besides our core friend group so on random occasions where every person was occupied it always hit me how extremely lonely i feel now as an adult it still hits me here and there everyone knows im an extreme introvert and love being home but lately ill be home for 34 days straight cant bring myself to leave my 1000sq ft apt i live alone in to get the mail take out trash or drive to run errands as my simple socialization for the day i have a bunch of things i could be doing outside errandwise or at home chorewise ex decluttering closets getting some freelance projects done job hunting etc but instead i cant bring myself to do any of them and fixate on my loneliness i let the dishes pile up eat junk foodinstant ramen just waste hours on youtube or the internet sit around crying for no reason and when people text me to hang out i decline i dont understand whats going on with me its like ive reached such a level of being a slob that i cant bring myself to get ready in 20 min to go outside and hang my family will even ask to have dinner or something and the thought of having to coordinate 3 different parties and choose a restaurant and think about 5 hours of productivity i wont get back though lets be real i wont be doing anything productive gives me extreme anxiety im torn between wanting to bask in solitude and being miserable being so lonely can anyone at all relate or is this an issue specific to me since childhood am i just a lazy pos and thats my problem,pre-pandemic
im sure weve all seen the memes the t shirts etc with jokes about guzzling down a bottle of wine or a six pack the jokes about getting blackout drunk and just basically abusing alcohol like its not a serious health problem i dont want to stop those who can consume responsibly from having fun but thats the key word responsible binge drinking is talked about these days like its something to be proud of and i believe this winealcohol culture is causing many who are suffering from addiction to not seek help because they dont see it as a problem in addition i think this culture makes is so hard for a recovering alcoholic to stay sober when you see things promoting drinking everywhere you go how could you not be triggered again i dont want to ruin anyones fun and i think drinking in moderation is acceptable if you can do it but i do think theres a problem with the way people glamorize binge drinking,pre-pandemic

im seeing a lot of posts on here with members of this community excusing other members for their blatant abuse of their partners it is unacceptable it is not our fault that we have ptsd but it is out responsibility to keep it in check and not harm others the amount of blame im seeing being put on the partners of members of this community after a person with ptsd has an outburst and abuses them is unsettling at best and triggering at worst imagine if someone was excusing your abuser in this way x200b edit i was really expecting to get burned at the stake for this post but the fact that we were all able to come together and talk about the elephant in the room and find a place of accountability and community makes me really happy thanks guys,pre-pandemic

cw sexual assaultabuse pedophilia panic attacks i am so happy and just proud of myself in general i was molested and sexually abused as a kid and it left me with a lot of emotional scars i get flashbacks and panic attacks a lot and even in a safe consentual environment if someone touches my genitals i have always either started crying or dissociated ive been on tinder lately and i met this really sweet woman lets call her stephanie and we sent each other memes for a couple days we decided to meet up for coffee and we talked for hours about music spirituality art being gay were both women and we really hit it off we went to the book store and then played video games at target and then we went to a park we kissed at the park and her lipstick got all over my face and we laughed at each other and i felt really comfortable with her we decided to go to her house to watch a movie long story short we cuddled for a bit and then ended up having sex it was really weird actually feeling comfortable enough to express myself like that with someone i didnt even have a glimpse of a flashback this probably sounds super lame but im really really proud of myself i feel like this was a huge step in healing from my trauma and allowing myself to exist beyond what happened to me as a kid i feel like one of the reasons why i felt so comfortable was because we talked a lot about boundaries and stuff beforehand and i mentioned that id been sexually assaulted in the past and that i might need to stop if i start freaking out and she was really understanding and sweet and always really communicative stephanie and i both agreed that we should definitely go on a second date im just really happy and gay and proud of myself and stephanie is really cute that is all,pre-pandemic

i have never seen any other mental illness frequently discussed with such venom borderline seems to always be the explanation for a woman expressing severe emotions regardless of the context or her history they make false rape reports out of anger they are incapable of long term relationships they have daddy issues and baggage theyre gold diggers and addicts this isnt even a sentiment isolated to the internet on the day i was diagnosed with bpd years ago i decided to go to a bookstore for more information the first thing that caught my eye was borderline personality disorder for dummies flipping through it i noticed a significant amount of the book was devoted to the last section how to get away from someone with borderline it was devastating to realize my fear of abandonment necessitated an instruction manual and wasnt a fear so much as an inevitability i am capable of and deserve love too goddamnit i can recognize when im being irrational and communicate my feelings i am on medication and in therapy the reason i have no family is because i was horrifically abused not because i drove them away i have made tremendous progress and i am proud of it i am not intrinsically a selfish aggressive person my disorder doesnt mean i should be thrown away,pre-pandemic

ive been reading posts here and i joined the discord for a few days i noticed some really serious issue being brushed off and blamed on adhd i read about a girl who was randomly messaging her friends and having freak outs at them for no reason she said there was no reason just a way to direct her adhd energy im reading about intense depression and moments of extreme emotion instability etc adhd might make these worse but the intensity and complete lack of control described in some of these postsconversations seem like either its the worst case of adhd in existence or real depression or bpd being worsened by the adhd brain if it is the latter then you need to get help or work on improving those other issues a common theme in these posts is that the op comes to the conclusion of oh im having psychotic freak outs just my adhd brain i think that these sort of mentalities get dangerously close to making their whole identity revolve around adhd if you blame every problem and every freak out on adhd it leaves little room to improve i understand that the adhd brain works differently but it is a functioning human brain many people with adhd are incredibly smart you can improve and you can get help im sorry if this is hard to read for some people but these really worry me and i thought id maybe make a post in hopes that at least one person benefits from it edit grammar and spelling,pre-pandemic

hello i am curious why adhd is considered a bad thing among pretty much everyone i realize adhd can be a bad thing in many or all scenarios in the modern world but i dont see why that makes adhd a bad thing the goal of medication is not to fix yourself the goal is to change your temperament to be more suited to the work and school environment adhd medication does not fix me because i am not broken having adhd does not make me disabled or mentally ill it is just an element of my personality i have noticed that people with adhd can bring up really interesting topics and dish out oneliners like no one else i have also found that people with adhd are very compassionate spontaneous and sensitive i have a unique way of viewing the world and a unique personality adhd shouldnt be considered a disorder because it is who i am yes i get distracted easily fidget constantly and cant remember things after a few minutes but that is who i am it is only a negative because of the world that we live in tldr adhd is not a disorder you should love your personality adhd and all adhd folks have generally great personality traits something often overlooked by everyone,pre-pandemic

who else had to unlearn normalizing and being flattered by men creepily leering and sexualizing you i thought the way men showed they liked me was when they leered and sexualized me i was groomed due to child sexual abuse and our sexist society i thought this behavior was normal i was flattered turned on traumatic bonding and brain changes and was attracted to creeps it didnt feel like love or like a guy liked me enough if they didnt sexualize me now as i have been processing my past trauma i realize how much i hate and fear being sexualized i dont want to be sexualized at all and get grossed out when men do i dont want to do anything sexual or even date for that matter i now see how wrong it is for men to minimize me to a sexual body i was so offended recently when i went to an educational discussion and at the end of the meeting the men were leering at my body how horrible that sex was the only thing that was on their mind instead of my intellect and what i could bring to help them so this is progress for me to realize how wrong sexism is because in the past i never saw myself as a feminist i still struggle with my body being turned on by creepiness because it was what was normal for so long i am actually afraid of my sexuality right now and feel shame and disgust about it especially when i become turned on by violating sex however im also noticing when i watch movies or see pictures of women getting sexualized i get grossed out and triggered more than i ever have i am now allowing myself to get grossed out by the creepers and being mean to them when i wasnt able to for most of my life i still have a part of me that gets turned on by creepiness and sexualization but i can confidently say it is starting to fade away especially as i continue processing my trauma and become more of a feminist i was brainwashed by society and the abusers in my life it is so bizarre to now see the truth and how what i was told was a lie about the sexualization and abuse of women to be normal and flattering i know with time and therapy i will be able to retrain my brain to be turned on by healthy sex with consent and boundaries completely i am already noticing that i am being drawn to these types of healthy relationships which i am very proud of myself for who else relate,pre-pandemic

hi folks im using a throwaway account as id like to be completely honest about my experiences i want to raise awareness in our community about the potential negative effects of wellbutrin also known as bupropion before i begin if you have found success with wellbutrin thats fantastic i will not suggest that anyone should drop a drug regimen that they find helpful we are all different and please note that i am only speaking anecdotally with that said please be aware that wellbutrin can cause very subtle yet extremely negative psychological side effects you should exercise extreme caution when taking it i dont believe that my doctor was fully aware of just how much influence it can have on a patients mental state some of wellbutrins powerful psychological effects are not acute but instead manifest over several months this delayed response makes it nearly impossible to realize that changes are occuring much less pinpoint what is causing them i hope that writing this might help other young men and women question the impact of a prescription that they might otherwise dismiss as harmless or only marginally impactful my background im 30 years old diagnosed as inattentivetype add when i was 13 i took dexedrine and wellbutrin for five years from 13 to 18 i trusted my physician and did not put much thought into the matter i made a casual choice to stop taking all medications around age 18 during my final year of high school and would only dose occasionally during studying ive recently resumed a regimen of a single long acting stimulant trying dexedrine biphentin and settling on vyvanse perceived effects as a teen the most notable aspect of wellbutrin to me as a teenager was the fact that i didnt actually feel any change at all dexedrine provided very obvious stimulant effects but wellbutrin may as well have been a placebo to me it came into effect on my personality over a long period of time and its lack of acute impact left me thinking that it was rather ineffective i was not diagnosed with depression when i was first prescribed dexedrine and wellbutrin they were selected for me after i had appetite issues under a daily dosage of ritalin the initial effects were similar but i had no problems with eating this was considered a success so i stayed with this combination my roomates suicide attempt my roomate was prescribed wellbutrin as an antidepressant and smoking cessation aid last year she was diagnosed as clinically depressed and had tried a couple medications before finding some success with wellbutrin despite being depressed she had never been suicidal or severely emotionally distraught over the three years we lived together her depression generally manifested as inattentiveness and a lack of motivation in her work and studies i believe that in her case she entered a negative feedback loop of use she was taking wellbutrin to alleviate symptoms of depression when it was in reality not only failing to treat her symptoms but magnifying and intensifying them ill skip the details but she barely survived the suicide attempt her doctor removed wellbutrin from her regimen with positive results over time she was very forthcoming in telling me what she was prescribed and i realized there were many disturbing similarities between her behavior leading up to her attempt and my experience as a teenager similarities and possible effects in hindsight the following is a short list of problems that i had attributed to hormones or had accepted as part of my personality at the time they are remarkably similar to my roommates experience 1 severe body image issues this was in spite of being normal even attractive in appearance i had minor acne but would spend hours picking at my face in front of mirrors i obsessively cleaned myself shaved body hair short and plucked my eyebrows im male 1 emotional instability and disproportionately intense responses i would cry myself to sleep several times per week in response to minor problems often without any reason at all it was the male equivalent of being in a constant state of pms i was extremely melodramatic when it came to love and relationships at this time it felt cathartic and even pleasant to recall several depressing thoughts in a row to cause myself to cry 1 prone to anger and violence i was suspended from school and sent to an anger management course after an extremely disproportionate response to light bullying i could be easily baited into yelling matches i hit my brothers punched walls kicked appliances and even went to so far as to return a slap from my mother during an argument 1 suicidal thoughts i suppose this was the natural result of the preceding effects i vividly remember contemplating suicide at age 17 because a vein on the side of my closely shaved head visibly moved with my pulse i found it repulsive and dreaded facing my classmates 1 insomnia and restlessness at night i consistently had trouble sleeping i would lie awake with my mind racing these experiences closely correspond to what my roommate went through before attempting suicide its been over ten years and i dont suffer from a single thing on this list today i now realize that my improvement roughly corresponds to the time when i stopped taking wellbutrin consistently i find it incredible that i never questioned these thoughts and feelings i never sought help and i never even for a moment considered that i could be so fundamentally changed by my prescription drugs i only stopped taking my prescription on a whim dexedrine was obvious it came on quickly and left just as fast the greatest danger of wellbutrin is its subtlety you cant fix a problem that you arent aware of and you wont ask for help when you are blaming yourself i hope this helps some of you ive read several comments on this subreddit from users who have had negative experiences with wellbutrin if you are taking this drug and your experience sounds in any way similar i urge you to consult your doctor,pre-pandemic

hello everyone recently i had an interesting conversation with an autistic woman up until that point i thought people with asd hated people and avoided them at all cost i guess i blame the media for that but she said that many autistic people actually love people and hanging out with them seeing them like a scientific project but considering it hard work to deal with social expectations norms and everything related my question is whats your opinion on this is it true and how do you feel about people,pre-pandemic

ive recently got through health anxiety and wanted to use my experience to help others ive waffled on a bit so if you dont want to read it all please just read the top 2 points as they are the key i can guarantee reading this is better time spent than googling symptoms know your enemy as you are on a health anxiety page youve likely had confusingly clear test results and already know your enemy isnt cancer ms hiv etc its anxiety dont underestimate your enemy feeling physical symptoms that cannot possibly be anxiety wrong the effects it can have on your body can be very physical very painful very scary and very real ill have to start my story partway through i was running up the stairs at work to get to my desk in time and slipped i fell awkwardly on the hand rail and heard and felt a rib crack work was a nightmare and had been for weeks id just become the manager of a new team and things were going wrong i carried on up the stairs in pain and a few days later went to hospital i had a chest xray and they confirmed a fractured rib work got worse and my cat became very ill and i really love my cat looking back all the signs were there months before this each time something stressful happened i got all hot felt sick and lost my appetite at the time i didnt think much of it then one morning everything changed a couple of days later i woke up with what felt like a burning hot hand squeezing my heart i couldnt breathe properly as i started to panic i ask my girlfriend to take me to the emergency department and i genuinely thought i was going to die i even kissed my cat goodbye thinking id never see her again i got seen straight away after an ecg and blood tests and a few hours of waiting my chest had settled but was incredibly tight i was asked if i had eaten anything yet as i got there at 6am i said no i was given toast and paracetamol and told there was nothing wrong with me and was shortly after sent home i think leaving without an answer was a real tipping point i took 3 weeks off work and in that time my body and mind spiralled downwards i kept catastrophizing what if i get fired from my job what if i cant work again and have to sell my house what if i am seriously ill and that one stuck meanwhile my body was malfunctioning all over the place my bowel habits changed for the worse my digestion was all wrong with reflux and heartburn i felt so weak and light headed then overnight i developed excruciating back pain that radiated up my neck i was sure now that the doctors had made a mistake and that my attack that day was something more this carried on at varying degrees for months deep down i kind of felt i cant be that ill as i went on holiday twice and felt a bit better when i was away but then at its worse i couldnt leave the house i even text my girlfriend when she was at work to say i had a flesh eating skin disease now known as a blister in my toe i fell into the trap of googling symptoms and trying to use the internet for reassurance id diagnose myself first with a stomach ulcer then gallbladder disease then pancreatic cancer new ones each week each time the doctor sent me for the tests which came back clear putting me back to square one believing it was me against the doctors who kept missing things one day after i had made 4 diagnoses in one day i felt enough was enough and contacted a councillor who fitted me in that day she took me to the beginning of the story i just wanted her to fix me and was puzzled why she was asking about recent bereavements earlier in the year i had been at a close relatives bed side when they died and my dad had a very risky operation that was 5050 if he would make it i thought i had dealt with that i got back into my car after the therapy session and was in tears obviously i hadnt she also made me think about what my triggers were my back ache had worn off a little in recent weeks a stressful conversation with my boss on the phone and it was back with a vengeance so the link in my brain was now correctly back ache due to anxiety rather than back ache due to randomly malfunctioning organ i also went to my gp who put me on sertraline which is a commonly used antidepressant for anxiety the side effects were difficult at first in fact 3 days in i was having panic attacks but after a week the side effects subsided after 4 weeks my physical symptoms virtually disappeared my health anxiety went with those pretty much i suppose humans are great at suppressing the knowledge that we are all going to die some day otherwise life wouldnt be much fun i think my experiences with death and illness of people close to me stopped me suppressing that and my stress and anxiety at the time made me relate it to myself so relating all of that together here is my advice cbt i have an app called quirk that really helps it gets you into the habit of challenging those irrational thoughts if apps arent your thing imagine you are in a courtroom being cross examined for your irrational thought being pressed for the actual evidence etc your brain carves out a path and the more you think the same the better and easier that path becomes for your brain challenge this path to start closing it off medication id never taken antidepressants before and never wanted to but the truth is they just calmed my whole body down after the side effects my physical symptoms reduced greatly which was a game changer not saying they are right for everyone speak to your doctor of course im definitely not a doctor therapy i was lucky enough to afford private therapy straight away i would recommend it to anyone they really get to the root cause she helped me break the cycle by getting me to relate my symptoms to anxiety triggers and not other illnesses lifestyle changes exercise helps but fitness isnt for everyone im a much more creative person so i forced myself to write some music and did things i enjoy whatever you do to enjoy yourself is better than sat worrying and googling symptoms work out your triggers if a certain situation results in a certain symptom this realisation can help immensely dont rule out anxiety just because one of your many symptoms isnt on a list we are all different do not google symptoms if doctor google was real he would have been struck off by now for getting everything wrong do not seek reassurance from statistics if it says 1 in a million people your age will get this illness you will still focus on the 1 do not seek confirmation of your self diagnosis from friends or family this will only reinforce the faulty path your brain keeps sending signals down tell them to shut you down if you talk about health keep busy and productive while taking care of yourself if a friend was going through a tough time youd but them a gift etc right do it for yourself above all if you have got this far you know its anxiety so take control and be proactive about fixing yourself hope this helps someone happy to talk to anyone going through this as it is horrible to go through you will be ok,pre-pandemic

sorry this is kind of a late update ive been so busy for context here is the original post here i remember lots of people asking for an update so here it is sorry if this sounds a little off english is my third language i listened to what everyone said and i really really appreciated the advice after taking the time to calm down i screenshotted all of his emails to show how he was lying and changing my grade he changed it 6 different times to make it seem like i was failing even more and trying to manipulate me into retaking his course as well as emails where he contradicts things that he had told me in the past i attached all those screenshots to a long long email calling him out professionally as well as explaining my side of things i also went as far as rhetorically questioning a lot of his statements in an effort to emphasize how callous and unreasonable he was being so that not only can he process exactly what hes been telling me and reflect on it but also for others reading the email as well i attached my disability counsellor him the chair running the department and the coordinator of the program within an hour he sent a rushed email saying he didnt want to deal with this then another email an hour later trying to save himself i didnt say anything and let the emails sit 2 days later i received an email back from him saying he was talked to by his bosses and that theyve decided to pass me for his class along with an apology for how insensitive and harsh he was being yay so glad i stood up for myself this time and i encourage anyone else to 100 do the same thanks everyone,pre-pandemic

look i get a lot of you are bipolar ii and have never experienced true mania or psychosis but closing your eyes and sticking your fingers in your ear anytime there is evidence that someone with bipolar said and did really shitty things doesnt negate the fact that these are often symptoms of the disorder can we at least distinguish them as symptoms as opposed to personality traits just because your symptoms are less doesnt mean you are a better person telling someone that it is their fault their an ass when psychotic is like telling someone it is their fault they have no energy when depressed and telling someone they need to learn to manage their symptoms betterfor fucks sake everyone knows that is near impossible to manage all episodes what if someone told you that when you were depressed im going to use kanye west as an example people in the bp community went into an uproar because they didnt want to be associated with someone who is displaying absolute signs of severe mania bordering on psychosis what are you trying to say that he was in complete control of himself and is responsible for all of his actions there is a disconnect between people who have less severe forms of bp being disgusted by what the severe manifestation of this disease looks like and there is a lot of ignorance how many posts are there about weeee im hypomanic i love this and then berating someone in the media for being manic and claiming that they have a gift just because mania manifests itself productively in some of your lives doesnt mean that is the case for everyone imagine your hypomania keeps going up and up and up youre having so much fun and then bang psychosis hits mania and psychosis can make you into a shitty person that doesnt mean its the persons fault my mother has psychotic episodes about once a year despite weekly doctors appointment and staying consistent with her meds in her psychotic episodes she calls the cps on my siblings claims my dad has raped everyone steals and pawns all of our stuff and manipulated everyone causing excessive trauma do i blame her not anymore than id blame a cancer patient for extreme fatigue this is a characterizing symtpom of our disease im sorry that you dont want to be associated with crazy but guess what you have the benefit of being bp ii and will never have to experience the ruin that comes from psychosis so instead of stigmatizing a traumatic stmptom maybe count your blessings that you have the lack of experience that lead you to be so ignorant about the disorder i have been downvoted by saying that having bp will likely lead your children to trauma guess what guys if you have psychosis you will inevitably leave trauma on your family maybe you take offense because your bipolar isnt that bad but anyone who has experienced psychosis will readily admit to this just as anyone who has cancer will probably come to terms with the trauma their illness is causing on others because anything that is that severe is going to have serious impacts you are not better than other bipolar people because your symptoms are less it doesnt mean that you have a better handle on things that youre more responsible that you are a nicer person someone who is psychotic is not less than you they arent a shitty person its not because they arent trying i think these diseases should honestly be called something altogether adding psychosis into the mix is closer to schizophrenia than it is bpii but a lot of people dont seem to recognize this for the record i am bp ii so i get that depression is hard but unless youve witnessed or experienced psychosis or severe mania you have no right in judging others edit okay apparently i triggered a lot of bpii people look if you have never judged someone for psychosis then just ignore this post completely this was all it was made for no i am not saying that bipolar ii people have it easy or that they are less than a bp i diagnosis im bp ii ive been hospitalized ive lost jobs ive lost relationships this isnt about one diagnosis being better than another its about people who have no experience with psychosis thinking that psychosis is just an extension of their hypomania and yes id argue bp i is a more severe condition im not saying that your bpii is easy i get it i have been on the verge of suicide multiple times however my mother gets crippling depression but guess what else she gets psychosis she is completely dependent on me and my family what people dont understand is that bpi is by its nature more severe than bp iiin fact bp ii can turn into bp i if the symptoms get more severe but in reality i never should have mentioned these diagnostic terms since thats all they are to begin with this post was simply about psychosis and about those who have never experienced psychosis outwardly judging those who have,pre-pandemic

i have ptsd due to being violently drugged kidnapped and raped in college my boyfriend and i have had lows in our relationship sexually because of this most times i have flashbacks because he does something small that triggers me and idk how to explain it to him so i act like nothings wrong but he knows today before we had sex we talked about it we discussed for 30 minutes everything we wanted to do and i told him everything i could think of that made me uncomfortable and i had the best sex of my life its a small success to some but being able to be intimate with my partner without fear of my ptsd and how it may seem to him is a huge step for me and i am happy to be able to have sex for the first time without any kind of trigger or fear normally i dont tell him during sex if im triggered but he can tell and he stops anyways today we had sex after 3 years of dating that was just us no ptsd just us and i feel like i made so much progress it just feels so good to know my rapist has no control over that part of my life anymore and that my intimacy with my partner sexually can develope more now,pre-pandemic

link to previous post im not a doctor so only read further if youve been checked out by your doctor and told youre healthy i wrote a post with tips for heart health anxiety a while back ive been struggling with some health anxiety in the past few days and i wanted to put some of the things that help me calm down in here x200b 1 a heart can either be healthy or sick theres no inbetween option a healthy heart is one thats been checked by doctors in some cases multiple times and by multiple doctors and theyve all agreed that theres nothing wrong with it the heart is obviously a vital organ so if there was something seriously wrong it would show symptoms but get this it would show symptoms constantly it wouldnt be like oh let me hurt a bit then calm down for the rest of the day and tomorrow ill get a few palpitations and then be fine for a few weeks and then act up again uh uh that is how a healthy heart acts when being confronted with other things such as stress anxiety food consumption alcohol sleep or lack of it smoking hard exercise hormones a sick heart would let you know there would be symptoms that dont go away a swelling in legs that lasts weeks pain that never stops breathing issues that get worst through months etc and for all of you that have been checked by doctors and told all clear a sick heart would show up on every no matter how basic of a test doctors do it would show up in blood works it would show up in ekg it would show up during a basic listen of the heart that doctors do all the damn time every time you go and ask for a check up the symptoms of a sick heart do not hide they make themselves present and every doctor will be able to see them and send you for further help asap x200b 2 a sudden heart attackcardiac arrest can happen under only a few circumstances x200b your heart is sickborn with a defect from birth these types of sudden heart attacksarrest are often if not always the result of someone not having symptoms and not checking their heart fully theyre usually quite young people whos never been to a doctor to get their heart checked and just assume that theres nothing wrong with them i have a friend 22f with no symptoms that went for a daytodate easy check up and the doctor heard a murmur in her heart straight away and now she knows what to do and what not to do if your doctor has checked you and told you your heart is healthy that means its just that healthy with no birth defect x200b youve lived usually 40 years of unhealthy lifestyle and youre probably also dealing with other issues such as high cholesterol arteries build up etc things that doctors again would have caught by now and told you to be careful and change your lifestyle for the better if you dont want to suffer a heart attack x200b an accident like getting electrocuted x200b a healthy heart does not just give up without outside force making it do so that outside force can also be food stress sedentary lifestyle but these are all things you can help yourself with if its something you cant help like lets say hormones during periodpregnancies like it was for me or work related stress all you can do is wait it out and believe it will come to an end it always does x200b 3 people who are perfectionists and good at focusing at a specific task until they fix the problem can and most likely will induce their own heart symptoms i know that i do im not much of a perfectionist myself but i can focus very strongly on things that i deem important if theres a problem ill focus on it until ive made it go away however example focusing on a heart palpitations ive got only makes me more stressed which in result brings even more palpitations and the circle begins realising that youre good at focusing can help you next time a symptom appears and your first instinct is to focus on it examine it from all sides think of all possible outcomes and completely ruin your mental peace in the process which leads to even more anxiety and even more symptoms x200b its nearly impossible to stop focusing on something that scares you so the alternative is instead of stopping the focus to shift it to logic shift it to past experiences when youve had this symptom and its gone away on its own shift to doctors telling you youre fine shift to i just had a lot of chocolate today its hormones its just stress and no this is not ignoring the problem believe me ive been there and id tell myself what are you doing how can you try to calm yourself that its just stress what if this time its not what if this time youre really really dying and well the simple what if this time in there should be enough to remind me that its happened before and well im still here x200b i hope this helps you a bit remember you can always get checked by a doctor even if its your 100th time if that brings you peace theres no shame in that i hope you feel better vey soon and have a wonderful day,pre-pandemic

im curious mainly because i finally got around to cleaning the closet this summer with the help of my mom i was shocked at just how much shit i had kept in there for whatever reason or another it even extends to my computer where i have software i think ill use but it instead sits there just wasting space after really wanting to make changes due to the improvements from me taking my meds im finding that its a lot easier to let things go now than they ever were in my life prior to all this how about you guys,pre-pandemic
disclaimer i began therapy less than a year ago and have only ever been to one therapist so my experience is very limited i have no idea if this will help others or apply to anyone elses situation but since reading it would have helped me i thought id give it a shot for the longest time i felt like my therapist basically chatted with me gave me compliments telling me how strong i was etc and just told me what i wanted to hear this made me angry and so many times i would leave our sessions thinking i dont need compliments i need help i could tell i wasnt getting anywhere but everyone i talked to who had been to therapy kept telling me that it takes time and i just needed to be patient i got so frustrated that i was one session away from switching to someone else i worked up my courage a little bit went into the session and said im frustrated with my lack of progress i feel like you are treating me carefully like i am fragile and ready to break at a moments notice telling me im strong makes me feel good temporarily but then i leave and im still in this deep black hole i need you to push me out of my comfort zone i need to know is there a way i can make faster progress stupidly i was afraid this would somehow offend her instead without batting an eye she simply said yes we can delve deeper into your trauma and start getting into the heavy stuff that is the fastest way for you to make progress i wasnt sure if you were ready for the rest of that session and for subsequent sessions she completely changed her whole demeanorapproach and let me tell you it was and continues to be so so shitty its been hard but im in a better place i can feel the sadness slowly lifting and i actually feel like im making progress now im so glad i didnt switch therapists before saying that it almost didnt even occur to me as a thing i should say to everyone out there whether youre in the same boat or not i wish you good luck 3 edit grammar,pre-pandemic
i posted an article on facebook about ptsd and my exfiances aunt commented on it why did you have this were you in the service i immediately want to respond and defend myself but i realized i dont need to open myself up about my traumas on a facebook comment just because you dont have ptsd from combat experience doesnt mean you werent traumatized and you dont have to justify yourself to anyone if you opened up to a therapist and they diagnosed you with ptsd thats all the justification you need i think im just going to respond to her with general information about ptsd because my trauma isnt anyones buisness but mine,pre-pandemic
i saw you staring at me i saw the way you were looking at my legs while we were waiting for our espressos you picked up a sugar packet from the bowl on the counter then our coffees came and you watched me drink mine black i saw you glancing at me then at your sugar packet then back at me then you put the sugar packet back in the bowl and gulped down your coffee with a grimace i desperately wanted to tell you that you look beautiful you dont need to worry about those extra 20 kcals from the sugar dont be like me please im an awful role model dont let the obsession with healthy living hold you back from enjoying the small pleasures in life like that small cup of espresso at lunchtime or drinks with your friends or a slice of cake on your birthday i hope youre ok,pre-pandemic

anyone else do this some days i wake up and right away im singing a song thats been in my head for days or im having a conversation with myself or even throughout the day its exhausting the same chorus of a song ive been singing it over and over again in my head for like three or four days and its just something im noticing of myself how compulsive it is for me to do it and not doing it feels wrong just wondering if anyone else experiences this type of thing and what you do to silence the inner chatter i meditate and do yoga and that helps me a ton but j cant always stop what im doing to clear my thoughts in that way,pre-pandemic
the test is unfounded bullshit but still the description for intp is an introverted person with well thought out ideas but a lack of purpose to execute them they often get lost in their own thoughts and have trouble communicating ideas they think of all possibilities when coming up with a solution and often start talking before theyve got there i genuinely think that what this is describing is someone with adhd intp personalities are supposed to take up 4 of the population this could easily fall into the band of people with adhd let me know if im an idiot reasons,pre-pandemic

ive cut off my friends for over a year now but they werent really friends just people i knew in all honesty i never was able to develop a true friendship in high school due to my reoccurring depression and generalized anxiety but now i have no one and its mostly caused by my own actions due to deleting all social medias avoiding social interaction at school and talking to no one when youve given up on life a long time ago you dont care if you have friends so ive been isolating myself until noone remembers me eventually i will have the courage to kill myself and when i do noone will remember if i was even here,pre-pandemic
kind of a question rather than a suicide post but i just needed to get this off my mind so whenever my friends send me cute stuff of their friends to them or just happycute things i immediately think about killing myself and im honestly not sure why anyone else has them too,pre-pandemic

so i work in a fairly small work setting i work with only 4 other people usually i can do whatever i want without being noticed because im so good at maintaining my duties today like many other days i cried at my desk for a few seconds just to let out the stress ive been carrying for a few weeks now my therapist recently opened up their own practice which doesnt accept my current insurance and my replacement therapists copay had risen to the point where i cant afford it so i dont have access to therapy anymore i didnt think it would be obvious until today i thought crying periodically was normal my bosss boss has access to all the cameras at my job and apparently today she saw me crying at my desk for a few minutes and immediately pulled me aside into a conference room to ask if i was okay because i immediately confess anything to any authority figure ever i told her exactly what i was crying about which she needed a little more context to understand so i ended up telling her everything behind my reason for crying today she was unbelievably understanding and empathetic with me however after the situation ended which was at the end of the workday as our discussion became very long i felt embarrassment and shame for telling my boss about my personal life specifically all of the problems i have she was very receptive and respectful she never interrupted me once and listened to everything i said she comforted me when i cried now that i am at home i am tortured by this interaction i am afraid that she will think i am not a competent worker or that im messed up and need a lot of help i cant shake off the heavy feeling of shame from opening up to her even though i know that she cared a about everything i had to say why am i completely overwhelmed with shame as if im acting and i dont deserve help even though everything i said was completely true why do i feel so utterly undeserving of help i hope i am not alone in this,pre-pandemic

and i am gradually withering away because of it mental health professionals never take me seriously i can see it in the hint of amusement in their eyes their disengaged body language their patronising tone of voice they say im too welldressed too articulate too intelligent i am too kind i smile too often im too calm this has not only been offensive to me but it is such an insult to people who are mentally ill and suicidal their implication that suicidal people are dumb frenzied and rude slobs was and still is fucking preposterous i have tried to get help for approximately 8 years i have begged and pleaded and been reduced to tears but unless im trying to end my life right now in front of them it doesnt matter none of it matters i dont matter my public face is too convincing but this was carefully created and crafted over many years because i had no choice i had no option but to hide the abuse and isolation and pain i have suffered behind a smile i was never given an alternative and when someone glimpsed the reality behind this faade they did nothing the truth is a part of me is frightened of dying and my survival instincts kick in when i dont want them to but that doesnt mean i want to live either if i could switch off this deeply ingrained fear and just be done with it i would why do we have to kill ourselves or almost die before people care why do we have to present ourselves in a specific way before we even get listened to why do they wait until every glimmer of hope and willingness to live has been stamped out i hate this i hate my life i hate myself let me be what they want me to be please edit i never ever ever consider others as dumb frenzied rude slobs by the way im so sorry if i made anyone feel that way its simply how i interpret the reaction of mental health professionals when they say but youre so cleverhygienicprettywellgroomed etc it feels like a slap in the face as though suicidal people are looked down on if they are well presented and looked down on if they are not too but the latter apparently ticks more boxes from their point of view if someone is unkempt hasnt showered is visibly distressed or less coherent i do not judge them or advocate doing so but using someones appearance as a way of invalidating their pain thats completely wrong edit 2 thank you everyone for your supportive comments and sharing your experiences on this subject it means a lot to me and although it is awful that this resonates with so many people it also brings me comfort i am sorry for not responding to everyone yet if you have had a similarly invalidating experience i am so sorry i appreciate the difficulty internalising this but it is not your fault you are not to blame for the misconduct of any medical professional who ought to know better than to belittle us during our darkest and most vulnerable moments in positive developments the crisis team visited me at home this evening both mental health nurses listened to me emphasised that the way i was treated for the last 8 years was unacceptable completely validated my feelings and showed a lot of empathy it has restored a little bit of faith in the nhs they are going to report back to the psychiatry team and recommend that i be allocated a care coordinator who will be able to assist me with being prescribed the correct forms of treatment and provide support with finances and social connections i have not allowed myself to anticipate too much but i cried with relief after they left i hope they keep their word i hope they meant it i desperately just hope until i receive an outcome i will sincerely try to stay alive i am not in a position to promise that i will survive but i can promise that i will try one more time,pre-pandemic
ive never said this to anyone especially not trauma survivors but i dislike the belief that trauma molds people into better stronger people i think anyone who experiences trauma has a right to feel stronger more empathetic braver etc if that is what they feel from their unique experience but its okay to not feel that way its okay to feel angry sad scared hurt and any negative feeling that comes from experiencing a traumatic event i am a survivor of childhood sexual assault and i fing refuse to attribute my positive qualities and achievements to those traumas before the traumas i was happy confident full of life trusting the sexual assaults literally altered my body and brain development my childhood was hell it was my inherent strength that got me through not the events themselves maybe for some people their trauma helped them see that they were strong and brave all along but i already knew that about myself before it happened i actually lost confidence in myself for not being able to stop the abuse when i tried im not some happy smiling cheerleader who says rape made me better because it didnt maybe for some people it does but not for me eta i know why some survivors say their trauma helped them grow to be stronger more thoughtful and better people because they made themselves learn to cope in healthy and beneficial ways which makes them feel stronger as people theres nothing wrong with that and that is what i agree with that is an empowering thing to know you got you through not the adversity but what you did to face it and overcome it but some people dont attribute their strengths and positive experiences from the traumas itself and thats okay everyones feelings are valid but we do not all feel the same and should not be lumped together please dont invalidate commenters in this thread for discussing their feelings because its not easy to talk about this thank you,pre-pandemic
but i didnt yay i guess i almost drove off the cliff i was so close to doing it but i sat in my car and i screamed just go home just go home just go home just go home until i made it home and then i sat in my driveway and sobbed when i went inside i broke down in front of my roommates and had a severe panic attack and my roommate just rubbed my back and helped me breath the next day my best friend took me out to eat i told her i almost did it and she said i could tell a few days before that you were off and i didnt say anything im sorry i should have i didnt want you to feel like i was smothering you but it just meant a lot that she noticed and that i could talk to her about it i have a great support system but im just living with this mental illness it hurts my life is so good but im just sick,pre-pandemic

its not gonna make him more likely to stay if he really likes me hell stick around hell want to get to know me rather than leaving the second i tell him that i cant have sex with someone im not in a committed relationship with hell respect my boundaries instead of trying to sweet talk his way into my pants in past sexual encounters ive had with men ive never enjoyed myself all i could think about was how this man doesnt love me that he can get this from anyone else and its not special but i want it to be special i deserve to be loved and respected and im tired of settling because im afraid of being alone im not having sex on the first date the second date or any other dates after that until the right guy shows me hes not afraid of my borderline or afraid of commitment it took me way too long to realize this i dont want to feel ashamed or dirty anymore,pre-pandemic

weve been seeing a worrying increase in prosuicide content showing up here and and also going unreported this undermines our purpose here so we wanted to highlight and clarify our guidelines about both direct and indirect incitement of suicide weve created a wiki that covers these issues we hope this will be helpful to anyone whos wondering whether somethings okay here and which responses to report it explains in detail why any validation of suicidal intent even an innocent message like if youre 100 committed ill just wish you peace is likely to increase peoples pain and why its important to report even subtle prosuicide comments the full text of the wikis current version is below and it is maintained at rsuicidewatchwikiincitement we deeply appreciate everyone who gives responsive empathetic nonjudgemental support to our ops and we particularly thank everyone whos already been reporting incitement in all forms please report any post or comment that encourages suicide or that breaks any of the other guidelines in the sidebar to the moderators either by clicking the report button or by sending us a modmail with a link we deal with all guideline violations that are reported to us as soon as we can but we cant read everything so community reports are essential if you get a pm that breaks the guidelines please report it both to the reddit sitewide admins and to us in modmail thanks to all the great citizens of the community who help flag problem content and behaviour for us rsuicidewatchwikiincitement summary its important to respect and understand peoples experiences and emotions its never necessary helpful or kind to support suicidal intent there are some common misconceptions discussed below about suicidal people and how to help them that can cause wellmeaning people to inadvertently incite suicide there are also people online who incite suicide on purpose often while pretending to be sympathetic and helpful validate feelings and experiences not selfdestructive intentions were here to offer support not judgement that means accepting with the best understanding we can offer whatever emotions people express suicidal people are suffering and were here to try to ease that by providing support and caring the most reliable way we know to deescalate someone at risk is to give them the experience of feeling understood that means not judging whether they should be feeling the way they are or telling them what to do or not do but theres an important line to draw here theres a crucial difference between empathizing with feelings and responding nonjudgmentally to suicidal thoughts and in any way endorsing encouraging or validating suicidal intentions or hopeless beliefs its both possible and important to convey understanding and compassion for someones suicidal thoughts without putting your finger on the scale of their decision anything that condones suicide even passively encourages suicide it isnt supportive and does not help it also violates reddits sitewide rules as well as our guidelines explicitly inciting suicide online is a criminal offense in most jurisdictions do not treat any ops post as meaning that will definitely die by suicide and cant change their minds or be helped anyone whos able to read the comments here still has a chance to choose whether or not to try to keep living even if theyve also been experiencing intense thoughts of suicide made a suicide plan or started carrying it out in the most useful empirical model we have the desire to die by suicide primarily comes from two interpersonal factors alienation and a sense of being a burden or having nothing to offer these factors usually lead to a profound feeling of being unwelcome in the world so any acceptance or reinforcement of suicidal intent even something innocent like i hope you find peace is actually a form of covert shunning that validates a persons sense that theyre unwelcome in the world it will usually add to their pain even if kindly meant and gently worded how to avoid validating suicidal intent keep the following in mind when offering support to anyone at risk for suicide people who say they dont want help usually can feel better if they get support that doesnt invalidate their emotions unfortunately many popular good responses are actually counterproductive in particular many friends and family tend to rely exclusively on trying to convince the suicidal person that its not so bad and this is usually experienced as i dont understand what youre going through and im not going to try people whove had help that made them feel worse dont want any more of the same it doesnt mean that someone who actually knows how to be supportive cant give them any comfort most people who are suicidal want to end their pain not their lives its almost never true that death is the only way to end these peoples suffering of course there are exceptional situations and we certainly acknowledge that for some people the right help can be difficult to find but preventing someones suicide doesnt mean prolonging their suffering if we do it by giving them real comfort and understanding an unfixable problem doesnt mean that a good life will never be possible we dont have to fix or change anything to help someone feel better its important to keep in mind that the correlation between our outer circumstances and our inner experience is weaker and less direct than commonly assumed for every kind of difficult life situation you will find some people who lapse into suicidal despair and others who cope amazingly well and a whole spectrum in between a key difference is how much inner resilience the person has at the time this can depend on many personal and situational factors but when theres not enough interpersonal support can both compensate for its absence and help rebuild it we go into more depth on the it gets better issue in this psa post which is always linked from our sidebar community info on mobile guidelines there are always more choices than brutally forcing someone to stay alive or passively letting them end their lives to avoid accidentally breaking the antiincitement rule dont say or try to imply that acting on suicidal thoughts is a good idea or that someone cant turn back or is already dead do whatever you can to help them feel cared for and welcome at least in this little corner of the world our talking tips offer more detailed guidance look out for deliberate incitement it may come in disguise often comments that subtly encourage suicidal intent actually come from suicide fetishists and voyeurs unfortunately this is a real and disturbing phenomenon people like this are out there and the anonymous nature of reddit makes us particularly attractive to them they will typically try to scratch their psychological itch by saying things that push people closer to the edge they often do this by exploiting the myths that we debunked in the bullet points above specifically you might see people doing the following encouraging the false belief that the only way suicidal people can end their pain is by dying there are always more and better choices than brutally forcing someone to stay alive or helping actively or passively them to end their lives creating an artificial and toxic sense of solidarity by linking their encouragement of suicide to empathy they will represent themselves as the only one who really understand the suicidal person while either directly or indirectly encouraging their selfloathing emotions and selfdestructive impulses since most people in suicidal crisis are in desperate need to empathy and understanding this is a particularly dangerous form of manipulation many suicide inciters are adept at putting a benevolent spin on their activities while actually luring people away from sources of real help a couple of key points to keep in mind skilled suicide intervention peer or professional is based on empathic responsiveness to the persons feelings that reduces their suffering in the moment contrary to popculture myths it does not involve persuasion dont do it cheerleading youve got this or meaningless false promises trust me it gets better or invalidation let me show you how things arent as bad as you think anyone who leads others to expect these kinds of toxic responses or any other response that prolongs their pain from expert help may be covertly prosuicide of course people sometimes do have bad experience when seeking mentalhealth treatment and its fine to vent about those but processing our own disappointment and frustration is entirely different from trying to destroy someone elses hope of getting help choices made by competent responders are always informed by the understanding that breaching someones trust is traumatic and must be avoided if possible any kind of involuntary intervention is an extremely unlikely outcome when someone consults a clinician or calls a hotline confidentiality is addressed in more detail in our hotlines faq post the goal is always to provide all help with the clients full knowledge and informed consent we know that no individual or system is perfect mistakes that lead to bad experiences do sometimes happen to vulnerable people and we have enormous sympathy for them but anyone who suggests that this is the norm might be trying to scare people away from the help they need please let us know discreetly if you see anyone exhibiting these or similar behaviours we dont recommend trying to engage with them directly,pre-pandemic
i often fantasize about dying i dont want to be here anymore its not even so much out of sadness anymore as it is just out of thinking realistically theres literally no point the only thing holding me back from doing it is i dont want to do that to my parents besides feeling like i just want to be dead i also deal with intense depression and thoughts that torment me i cant shake the feeling that something is just wrong with me and im never going to be happy or deserve to be happy theres this void in me and no matter what i do nothing fills it i tried talking to my ex about this while we were dating i told him about my self harm and how i just want to die about the self harm he told me to cut the right way if i wanted real results for the depression and suicidal thoughts he said he felt the same except he had a worse life so his depression was more justified he said i have a lot to be happy for it just made me want to kill myself even more but the thing is i dont think i want to die i just wish everything would stop and i could start over as someone else and honestly when i think about killing myself i fantasize about it not working but working just enough to hospitalize me its a sick fucking thought i know i think the main reason i want to attempt suicide is so the people around me will realize that im not just faking it or choosing to be depressed its not just for attention which is ironic to say considering i want to do it literally to get their attention but i just feel like in order for my pain to be taken seriously i need to show it to people somehow,pre-pandemic
even if you have them and know you wont act on them i get in phases where every time something upsets me i have very graphic images of all the ways i could kill my self my ocd urges it on and my irrational side tries to tell me its the best option i have too many responsibilities for that ever to be an option though even if i have doubts that ill ever be happy but i cant say this to anyone because theyll freak out theyll think they should call a hospital or tell someone in my family or at the very least treat me differently or not let me tell dark jokes and all those types of reactions end up doing are further isolating me in my own mind while pretending to be relatively fine on the outside edit this is my first time posting here and i am overwhelmed that my post has resonated with so many other people here i hope to hear from more people please pm me or u me in a comment if youre interested in talking about something in particular like someone mentioned ocd and intrusive thoughts,pre-pandemic
tdlr i chose ice cream at the store over razor blades after a terrible day still recovering from it but i made the right choice i had a really terrible day last saturday but i did something really great it started off with being coldshouldered by a girl i really like at work didnt start the day off well i then went in and it was chaos for 8 solid hours i work on a psych ward and it was literal hell dealing with really unwell people i wont say any more than that other than the fact it all went tits up multiple times during the day added to that my ex sent me a slew of abusive messages calling me a terrible dad and an embarrassment to my kids i got these texts on my break and spent the majority of the shift holding back tears whilst trying to look after my patients on the ward to top it all off work called me once id got home saying that my paperwork wasnt right and i had to come back in id already taken my seroquel and i was drowsy as hell but i went back as asked when i got home i was more suicidal than i had been in many years i wanted to hurt myself badly i popped out a couple of tablets and tried to work out how many id need to hurt myself like i wanted to i then went across to the store to buy razor blades halfway there i texted my mum and my ex a suicide note fully intending it to be my final night somewhere around the store i caught hold of myself ive been on a diet for months and have lost a lot of weight but i chose my favourite ice cream and went to the checkout i looked at the razor blades but thought better of it i ended up back at home crying into my tub of ice cream but i didnt self harm this time i chose the less unhealthy option i couldnt take an overdose because i knew i didnt have the right combination of pills to do it properly so i replaced them in my meds cabinet and carried on eating i took the least unhealthy or most unhealthy option that night and i didnt hurt myself considering i have borderline personality disorder as well im proud of myself my waist line wont be proud of me at my next weigh in but i still made the right choice thanks all for listening to my shitty story moral of the story make the right choice even when every part of you wants to do something stupid,pre-pandemic

my life has been really fucking shitty for the past 9 months or so i had really bad anxiety attacks then ive had anxiety my entire life but these were the worst attacks ive ever had and that ended up forming into depression after fearing i would always be horribly anxious everyday combine that with constantly going on and off with nicotine withdrawal and thats where i was at while i still deal with depression and anxiety i really thought i had been steadily improving this month felt like the best month for me in a long long time and i still think thats true ive been having problems with my throat that makes talking hard in the past year and i finally went to an ent specialist for it and started treatment my depression felt like it was dying down and my health anxiety was put to ease after the ent appointment confirmed i didnt have cancer or anything and then today happened i didnt even know i had a doctors appointment today checkup i got there and like usual everything seemed alright with me except for my heart rate and blood pressure im 20 years old and have an anxiety attack practically every time im at the doctors office my pulse was 139 while my bp was 14199 i now have to monitor my blood pressure for the next month or so get blood work done and go back in a month i was also up to 169 pounds today was always around 150 during high school im just so fucking tired of this i just turned 20 ive been an athlete all of my life except for the past year dealing with these issues and i was starting to get back into daily exercise still am im a smart kid have money in my bank account despite not working full time student i feel like ive been doing things the best i can and yet i always end up back here im just so tired you know whats even worse im not stupid and im not heartless i know damn well people have it worse than me and that makes me feel guilty complaining like this a kid i knew in high school developed leukemia and lived through hell for two years before having to ask his own mother to let him go and here i am complaining about my problems any encouraging words would be much appreciated im just so exhausted im 20 years old and i treated my body well for the first 18 years of my life and while i havent treated it great in the past 2 most people i know my age treat theirs even worse and are fine now im sitting here with mental health problems and possible high blood pressure at 20 it just feels so fucking unfair,pre-pandemic

this sub has helped me through a lot of health concerns but today im finally in a place where i can deal with it on my own so im posting to hopefully help someone else i started off as a mess and eventually got a full heartbody checkup including an mri and wore a heart monitor for 24hours to check out my palpitations after being told that everything is fine that was a big step getting a professional comprehensive medical diagnosis to rule out what youre worried about goes a long way after chest pains numbness tingling in my limbs dizzy spells being sent to the er because urgent care thinks i might be having a stroke and a ton of other shit something outside my control changed my stress level i took on a different role at work that is much less stressful i had no idea how big of an impact this was because i didnt consider myself stressed but several symptoms subsided with this change like everything digestive and the chest pain is less frequent after i was told the chest pains are costochondritis inflammation of the rib tissues read stressinduced i saw a chiropractor for about 5 months who taught me some stretches and selfadjustments i could do with a back roller and now ive trained myself not to panic when i feel those chest pains just do the stretches and trust that im fine and sure enough i am also my doctor told me to cut caffeine and i didnt listen i am a coffee junkie and cut back but didnt cut it out entirely well recently i switched to decaf i know stick with me and its been lifechanging yes this is obvious yes we all know caffeine raises your physiological arousal level but many of us keep consuming caffeine not realizing just how much it actually contributes to the cycle im a much happier person on decaf and i dont think ill go back i found out all of the shit i was dealing with can be caused by anxiety so this whole time it was the fear of a health problem that was causing health problems stress impacts us more than we realize so to recap here are the things my dumb ass put off doing forever that really made a huge impact get a doctors opinion as in a thorough one if possible instead of just a quick visit they will run some tests and give you a professional take on it when you get this trust it if you have reason to believe the doctor missed something get a second opinion but really you should trust the doctor manage your external stress this doesnt mean quit your job but if something is stressing you out a situation at work a significant other family take some real steps to get out of that situation in my case it was a lateral transfer and a change in responsibilities but man did it lower my stress levels cut the caffeine and any other stimulants including recreational ones if you struggle with anxiety your brain is already pumping you full of stress hormones in a fightorflight response you absolutely do not want to make it worse even a little can impact some people like me apparently for the love of reddit never google your symptoms the terrible thing about anxiety is once it has you its a downward spiral but the inverse is true too once you are confident in your situation and know the quirks of your own body you can come out of it quickly too hope this helps someone,pre-pandemic

ive been seeing a lot of this lately does this sound like ptsd to you i think someone i know has ptsd how can i be sure i experienced something bad do i have ptsd please ask a mental health professional these questions this community cannot diagnose you and frankly its disrespectful to ask you wouldnt ask a cancer patient if they think you have cancer youd ask a doctor the same goes for any other medical issue if you think you have it ask a professional dont selfdiagnose dont ask people who are already fighting it to diagnose you we can help on the back end with coping suggestions and techniques but we cannot help diagnose you and it would be irresponsible to try,pre-pandemic
i was trafficked as a childyoung adult obviously there were many people involved in this situation but there was one man that was mostly in charge i got news a couple of weeks ago that he died in prison everyone in my life feels like i should be happy or relieved about that but im not happy at all its really painful i feel like im in mourning over his death i keep having dreams about all of the nice things he did for me handing me a glass of water allowing me to sit on the couch after a particularly violent encounter giving me a blanket to sleep with when i was really sick i cant stop i literally catch my brain thinking that this dude loved me and im really sad that ill never be able to see him again which is probably the most fucked up thing ive ever thought in my life seriously this man killed my daughter and essentially ruined my life but my brain is somehow trying to convince me that he loved me it makes me nauseous that i could even think that but somehow it creeps back in ive told a couple people in my life about these feelings and everyone is like dude thats fucked up how i dont know how im crazy i dont know i guess i just wanted to share with some people who might understand i am hoping these weird feelings pass quickly and never come back jesus,pre-pandemic

whitesilver dots this probably is the scariest now that i think about it cuz i dunno why i get them in my vision from time to time only last about half a second cob webs in vision probably just from aging who knows left eye pain julynovember on and off usually after lifting heavy weight in gym but i thought for months this was optic neuritis a prevalent symptom of ms scotomas in vision when looking at the sky augustpresent about the same time as the migraines started dizzynessaugustdecember on and off the list goes on but you get the picture the above are majority of symptoms that fit the ms criteria to say the least this past year has been a living hell for me and has turned a lot of good days into brutally awful days i thought there was going to be no hope for me on numerous occasions i thought the possibility of ms was going to be a real reality for me that i would have to give up the career i was pursuing which requires me to be healthy and do something else with my life the possibility of what will my significant other think what if my quality of life is effected etc etc so many of these thoughts inside my head consumed me day in and day out after the migraine symptoms and losing my vision temporarily and having a numb right arm after i decided to take action saw family doctor about issues late august saw family doctor two weeks later as symptoms werent getting better family doctor going to refer me to a neurologist late october get in to see neurologist neurologist refers me for mri jan 13 mri appointment jan 25 results are back but have to wait until feb 13 to see neurologist i think this time period was the worst anxiety wise feb 13 neurologist appointment feb 13 the day has finally arrived this is the day that is going to change my life forever the day i receive my diagnosis of ms i thought all was over i sit down in my neurologists office he starts talking as if hes going to give me some bad news and then he says it appears there was no indication of demyelination diseases in your mri scan demyelination disease is ms and it came back normal i was so relieved i started crying in tears of joy as soon as i left the neurologists i felt like i have just been rejuvenated like i have been given a second chance i felt so much weight slip off both of my shoulders and i immediately felt like the sky is still the limit for myself going forward it is still surreal to this day and i am so thankful without a doubt i know i will still be battling this terrible hypochondriasm going forward as i know for a fact that it is not that easy to just get over i will be seeking therapy in the near future and doing everything i can to be the best version of myself day in and day out i will keep fighting and i believe you guys will keep fighting as well and i am here for you i just wanted to tell my story to maybe give hope to others and to show that many of my symptoms that i had were all caused by anxiety and stress and that the brain is a very powerful organ that is capable of causing symptoms like that i made a post earlier leading up to the neurologist appointment and there were a few of you that wanted to know how it went so hopefully you come across this post and thank you to everyone who took the time to read this it was a long one keep fighting the good fight you are not alone,pre-pandemic
im sorry if this feels offtopic but i thought it was relevant in a sub for people who struggle with selfworth and a long history of rejection it shocked me to find so many supportventingsuicide posts in new downvoted to zero points there were 3050 of them i upvoted them back to 1 point but they still show 50 upvoted i wouldnt have the nerve to leave my post up if that happened to me i would delete it and never post here again i am so impressed that so many of you hung in there and left your post up even after you saw zero points on your request for support,pre-pandemic
i dont know how many of you saw it and i havent checked to see if my karma is now at 100000 but i made a comment the other day while manic about how hypomania is fine and can be sustained at a reasonable level i was of course wrong and have now slipped in to a mixed state and caused a real shit storm tonight but thats another story and im also feeling very guilty for saying something so irresponsible and inappropriate so if anyone saw it and was offended or upset i apologise from the bottom of my heart and i hope im still welcome in this wonderful and supportive community,pre-pandemic
and i still cannot escape this prison of not being able to trust myself or my own decisions the more clarity i attain the more shame i feel for my manic actions and decisions the embarrassment of making poor decisions weighs on me i feel pity from the people around me whove watched me dance through these episodes delusions of grandeur unstable moods crippling anxiety and immovable depression im doing everything right i just want it to stop,pre-pandemic
but you are going to be fine whatever illness you currently think or may have youll look back one day and realize that you are just okay any anxiety you have is only temporary medical advancements are made every single day and you are not a lost cause so take a breath its the holidays spend time trying to be as happy as you possibly can even if you have to fake it til you make it and i know its easier said than done,pre-pandemic
ive been clean for almost two years now and heroin was my drug of choice but i did meth from time to time this morning in my way back from taking my daughter to the bus i found a sizable bag of meth on the ground i brought it inside and eventually flushed it but i really struggled with it i rarely have cravings anymore but i also havent had anything in my face like that anyways im still here and still clean just kinda stressed at the moment,pre-pandemic
1 get a symptom ive not experienced before 2 spend days agonizing and having mild panic attacks about worst case scenarios afraid to make an appointment because rationally i know its probably all in my head 3 finally fear and stress outweigh my embarrassment and rational thinking and i make an appointment 4 symptom is almost resolved by the time i get in but i go anyway so i dont fall back into a fear spiral 5 doctor confirms nothings wrong and my health anxiety fades and now ive wasted the doctors time and i think he thinks im a crazy freak social anxiety and shame spiral ensues,pre-pandemic
i honestly dont mind one single bit for many people this sub is the only place they have to turn to for anything ed related its the only support or community they have for help and questions and yes we can argue people should look for posts before they post their own post to avoid repetitive posts but honestly i dont mind at all often we are not in the right frame of mind to look through posts we are freaking out and need quick reassurance an answer or to vent right now if people are restricting sometimes the concentration needed to read through prior posts just isnt there let people freak out about weight gain even if we all know its water weight let people ask if others fee invalid most of us just want quick connection and validation just somewhere where we can give a voice to the ed part of us that needs help so i just love every post and every post is valid except trolls of course in my opinion ask away rant away post away ps sorry for the clickbait title lmao,pre-pandemic
this happens to me so much i will get an idea for a new hobby or project or something im really into decide its my new favorite thing ever spend a lot of money on the highest end supplies or merchandise to cement its place in my life and then very shortly after i will either get bored of it overwhelmed or just fall into a depression and stop caring about anything including the new thing the last thing i did this with was cosplay i decided i wanted to go to a con and chose the most elaborate and difficult armor to make from scratch out of foam i wanted to spend all my free time working on my foam armor and spent so much time and money doing research buying materials foam box cutters paint costume templates and tutorials etc i even set up half of my bedroom around this project with all my tools and work table 2 weeks later i decided i didnt have the skill for it and gave up even though i had made some good progress now every time i walk by that part of my room i feel so guilty for giving up on something i spent so much money on anyone else do this is this a bpd thing,pre-pandemic
i never knew the worst case of depression is when tears are no longer flowing in your eyes since last month ive been taking high dosages of antidepressants hidden from everyone but myself i had no one to rely on my bestfriend gets mad whenever i speak about my anxieties saying that shes afraid to be with someone who is mentally and emotionally unstable i cant speak to my parents about how i feel because they just tell me that everybody has problems and force me to keep going on with the routines i should be doing i just want to shut down i have no selfesteem left and i have never felt this way before this is probably going to be my last reddit post i left home earlier today ready to do this ive been told that id go to hell when i die perhaps its time to go and check it out,pre-pandemic

i have really bad health anxiety of course so i always worry about myself having health issues or dying but i also spend a lot of time worrying about people close to me dying like lately ive had this bad feeling that my boyfriend is going to die i know its incredibly irrational as he is a healthy 26 year old but i just cant shake the feeling i would be so devastated if something happened to him because he is my soulmate and i know i would never find a love like this again i worry about the same thing with my mom shes my rock and if anything ever happened to her id be completely lost does anyone else have this how have you been able to talk yourself through it,pre-pandemic
if you say youre so depressed you cant function its aw itll get better and they forget about you then when you kill yourself everyones like oh i never wouldve thought i wish he wouldve given some sort of sign i said how many times i want to kill myself and i think i might do it but i know if i do people will act like its a huge surprise ive been serious all along i have a rope tied into a noose in a box in my room so that its always ready im not joking or just looking for attention when i tell people i need some kind of help everybody only pretends to care and then when youre dead tries to say they cared all along,pre-pandemic

so i was at my tattoo shop last week getting a small one done and my artist and a few other people were talking about how they dont get how people can throw up and not be loud how weird silent pukers are and i just went i can puke quiet but thats only because of the eating disorder and the whole shop just kinda went dead im amused by how uncomfy everyone became lmao,pre-pandemic
mine was that having constant content warning suicidal thoughts were completely normal even if its practically all i could think about from when i woke up to when i went to bed it got to the point where i had to have my mom pick me up cause i couldnt walk two blocks without thinking about jumping infront of a car edit i just want to point out that this post has been getting downvotes and i would like to offer a reason why this question is important degrees do not mean that everything a doctor says is correct there are surgeons who kill patients anesthesiologists who put people under while theyre still conscious and they can still feel all of the pain psychiatrists who push benzos purely because pharmaceutical companies paid them to and psychologists who are unaware of manic episodes and their intensities so they support grandiose ideas as just depression being alleviated professionals make mistakes but in this field mistakes cost people lives if your doctor isnt right for you find a new one there are psychs who are helpful and good and amazing it takes time,pre-pandemic
i feel like its very common for people to cycle through bingerestrict cycles but ive never really experienced that rather than bingerestrict its more like just restrictnot restrict i go through periods of eating a relatively normal healthy amount and then out of nowhere it gets super easy to restrict for a few weeks and there are so many reasons why this makes me feel like a fake whiney baby eating a normal amount makes me feel fake because i clearly am not repulsed by food and i dont have to force it down i enjoy it i mean during these periods my thoughts are exactly the same as when i restrict and i always would rather be restricting i feel the same guilt over the food i eat but i still eat it in the first place since developing an ed ive lost weight pretty consistently only gaining real weight when ive gone on vacation or during holidays but i lose weight slowly as fuck ive lost only 35lbs since last may and i have been having these disordered thoughts for almost the entire time but where the fuck am i suffering i clearly dont have an issue with the act of eating if i decided to recover i feel like it would be relatively easy for me because i fucking love food i feel like some wannarexic lmao i want to restrict 100 of the time and lose weight super quickly but i cant because i dont actually have an eating disorder im just forcing one even though ive restricted to the point where im underweight i just feel like i dont match any criteria for any eating disorders i have no binging or purging issues so i dont see how i could have ednos but i feel like i eat normally enough of the time for anorexia to be wrong as well part of the reason i want to lose even more weight at this point is because if im underweight enough then i know i have an eating disorder for sure this post is a mess lmao im just sick of my own bullshit and idk how common this is,pre-pandemic

i drive myself crazy when i dont know whats going on in a situation i have to talk my feelings out i have to figure things out i dont like to leave any room for assumptions because when i start assuming i cant stop i make lots of scenarios in my head and it drives me to be angry sad etc i am aware that i am like this and make it known to people but they dont listen when they dont listen i only get more upset this just goes back to a post i made before about how being alone might just be better i dont see why its so hard to just sit down and converse it saves a lot of time and confusion its only after i react to someone not doing a simple thing that people want to act like im crazy if i ask you to tell me why you feel a certain way im doing it for the both of us if you shut down give me a halfass answer etc i wont know what to do with myself or our situation and i shouldnt have to know i cannot read minds bpd or not everyone deserves something i hate this no one owes you anything attitude that everyone has i get that maybe its true but when you care about someone why would you not do everything you can to give them reassurance and comfort especially when you know theyre struggling mentally,pre-pandemic
soooo buttons i know you spend a lot of time on here you tease me because i am not as tech savvy and mostly just use facebook to save vegan recipes and argue with homophobic republicans which you hate and always say is not healthy for me probably true but i finally downloaded the app to post this half hoping you would see this and half hoping you wouldnt we cant seem to have a real conversation since i discovered your recreational use of painkillers has escalated to a full blown addiction i use the term discovered lightly since i think you wanted to get caught by me not the cops not your family not your best friend who is also your sponsor from your adolescent meth addiction me so that begs the question what is my role here i have spent the last week alternating between becoming an expert on opioid addiction and forensic grade lie detection i have foregone my own basic needs to make sure you arent using i stay up at night and think back on the last year which is when you said the addiction started and have become a brilliant mind in timelines and flow charts of people places and lies my adeptness at this has resulted in the realization this addiction has likely gripped you for the greater part of our relationship 7 years in march probably in large part due to my own occasional use in the last week i have turned the home we were once so proud of into nothing less than an intensive inpatient therapy unit i drive you to meetings not knowing if you will stay or leave to find some shady dealer i deal with your urine and your putrid sweat i see you hold your hands out for your suboxone like a pauper begging for bits of bread and i find it disgusting i think back on all the times you could have odd and i hate us both when i first met you i was so attracted to you you were so self aware intelligent and well read you were so in control of your mind but so awkward with yourself our first date you were so nervous and sweet i loved that about you so what now how do we come back from this statistically according to my late night research at least we have a 1 in 76 chance once i factor in that i am pretty sure you still arent being totally honest with me i think it leaves us at a 1 in no chance i am lost in this five feet of darkness and lies between us please come find me and bring a bright fucking light to shine in every ugly and humiliating corner becuase that shit doesnt scare me just dont shut me out kapish love pickles,pre-pandemic
i dont know how i did it maybe i do actually i do know i just stopped researching and came to realize it was time to stop this feeding chain of reactions i distracted myself i remember in february 2019 this was at my complete severe moment i isolated myself all i kept doing was researching the symptoms of a brain tumor begging my parents to take to the hospital the amount of panic attacks i would get during school and at home i fell into a deep spiral of shit at that month it was hell but then later on i stop doing that i sat down and realized maybe i should relax and not look up those things it is tempting but i dont i still struggle mentally im bipolar so thats more of a struggle at least im on suffering thinking i have a brain tumor i kept that rational thought of if i were to actually have it there is nothing i can do to prevent or change it there is no reverse effect to erase it i still however do sometimes think about it but it goes away for a while,pre-pandemic

i just wanted to share with people wholl understand id been seeing him since i was first diagnosed when i was 16 im 24 now i can honestly say he saved my life he always managed to find the right combination of meds and hes the main reason ive been relatively stable moodwise for the past 4 years it wasnt a huge shock he was very old and i always knew he would end up dying while i was his patient but at the same time it felt like hed live forever he studied psychiatry because his brother died by suicide and he practiced medicine until the day he died i always admired that about him he was a good man so cheers to my former doctor i wanted to give him a tribute of sorts hopefully this is an appropriate space for that,pre-pandemic

my dad called me the other day to tell me some news my molester brother was coming to christmas with his partner and my dad was wondering if i would be able to handle it without making a scene everyone will be there including sisters boyfriend it would mean a lot to mom to have all of her children under one roof he continued before grandpa died he said all i want is peace in the family and thats what i want my brother used violence to coerce me to commit sexual acts on him from the time i was 514 and he was 1120 when i told my school guidance councillor she was mandated to report it and an investigation was initiated on the morning of my first interview with the police my dad took me to breakfast at my favour restaurant in our small town where he said you can either put your brother in jail or you can keep the family together i lied to the police told them i didnt want to talk about it the investigation went away my parents never punished nick when the investigation was over they let him pick any city in the us and they would help him move there he picked nyc that was 11 years ago ive kept my silence to keep the family together my parents keep reminding me in our bitrimonthly family fights that there was nothing we could do and there will be no more family if you keep up with this my brother is always playing the saint and they just fawn over how success and accomplished he is hes seen as the darling helper who could do no wrong whenever i try to talk to my family about what he did they tell me tell your therapist that not us in my mom and is most recent fights she let out a tirade of why didnt you tell me it was happening why didnt you tell me one time and then followed that up with when i was a little girl i prayed to god that i would have kids but now after all of this i wish i never was a mom i have been trying to go nc with my brother but my family doesnt seem to respect that i often get texts from him in the family group text saying overly positive shit like nothings up hes coming to christmas and my parents wanted me to go on a trip with everyone else including him and his girlfriend where i would be expected to not make a scene i need some sort of grounding because ive been keeping quiet with this hell of family and rape for 21 years first so my brother wouldent get in trouble and secondly so my parents wouldent look bad to their family and friends the biggest hypocrisy of this is that i was sexually abused as a child by another perpetrator a older man who abused me for 2 years concurrently with the time i was being abused at home i told my mom what had happened he then was charged and convicted and sentenced to jail i had my parents full support then i told my parents about this man abusing me in particular first so they would know how to handle my brother turns out they didnt i am still glad i told them in that order because if i had told them about my brother and then the older man they would have covered up both and i likely would have killed myself from the stress that i otherwise barely survived edit thank you everyone for your support,pre-pandemic

is smiling a common problem for those on the spectrum i have recently started a job in retail but often find my colleagues telling me to smile more whilst i have been diagnosed with autism and adhd i dont consider myself to be a particularly unhappy human beingyet my resting face usually looks very intense i was only diagnosed with autism about two years ago i am almost 28 but i have always been encouraged to smile more i have even been mildly derided for my neutral expression by being nicknamed smiler in my teens im beginning to question if i should quit my new role as i dont want to upset customers or scare them away,pre-pandemic

your brain is crazy powerful and can literally cause you to experience newmore symptoms it can also make you more aware of perfectly normal traits and twinges that youve always had but had never paid attention to until now your brain is powerful but it doesnt control you you do have the ability to take control back it takes a lot of practice and hard work but you arent doomed to forever be a victim to your anxiety even if you need some help in the form of medicine or therapy theres hope for you to feel calm again this has been my mantra lately and i wanted to share it with everyone in the hopes it could help someone else,pre-pandemic

today i am 4 months sober ahhhhthat feels amazing to say because for some reason i have mostly kept my sobriety to myself im not sure if its because i dont want people to be weird about it or perhaps i dont feel like answering peoples questions as to why i have chosen to pursue an alcohol free existence but either way only a select few people are aware of my life change over the years i had progressively sunk deeper and deeper into the darkness of alcoholism and a turn of fate put me in a position to make a choice and although it has been a very hard path each af day seems a little bit brighter i just wanted to tell somebody that is all thanks for listening,pre-pandemic

about six years ago i was diagnosed with hodgkins lymphoma i battled it for several weeks before i was finally cured this was my first encounter with a terminal illness at the age of 15 i was healthy for a long time everything was great until i discovered i had a brain tumor i didnt have headaches often but this one could only have one explanation i knew i only had a few months left to live miraculously my tumor atrophied over the course of a week and completely disappeared i felt normal again things were great i was a new person until i contracted hiv i knew it the second it happened i wont go into details about the event that led to this but what else could explain the enlarged lymph nodes about a week later and then the fever and night sweats every symptom of a new hiv infection listed on wikipedia fit perfectly except for the ones that didnt this was the first major disease i had that lasted more than a month in fact it lasted over half a year i purchased my first hiv test kit 16 days after the initial infection i knew that the detection window was usually 46 weeks after the initial exposure but i religiously adhere to the mantra of better safe than sorry of course this test came back negative but i already expected that i was able to wait another 2 weeks at which time i immediately purchased a test kit twopack 58 for two tests was a better deal than 37 for one and hey i need to start buying in bulk if i want to test myself as often as my brain tells me i should test 2 came back negative but lets be honest only 75 of people infected will test positive 4 weeks after exposure i figure that since my immune system was naturally already so weak i get a cold maybe once every year or two i would probably take a bit longer to test positive i used the second test at 6 weeks which is around the 90 accuracy mark negative ive always been unique eight weeks and 4 tests in and it finally happened as i sat and waited the 20 minutes for the test results i broke into a cold sweat i already knew the answer and by the time i flipped over the test swab i had already accepted my fate negative fuck just be positive already so i can move on with my life alright alright not to worry im still only in the 96 accuracy window thats 4 people out of 100 that get a false negative 2 out of 50 1 out of 25 im way more unique than 1 out of 25 im like 1 in a billion 1 billion times 1 out of 25 is like 40000000 which means i must have hiv right i accepted my diagnosis even though the damned test kits kept lying to me i didnt really need their confirmation to live like a sick dying person heck i was really good at living like a sick dying person all on my own i had plenty of experience with it having already survived 2 terminal illnesses to this point i wallowed in self pity for another two months before the panic started to come back i was beginning to feel a bit sick sore throat runny nose uh oh i knew what that meant aids was setting in and i had just developed an opportunistic infection my immune system was probably already compromised even before i got hiv which is why the tests kept coming back negative i mean i dont have a scientific source for this but if you have no immune system in the first place then youre not going to develop any antibodies to hiv when you contract it and since the hiv test i had used detected the presence of antibodies and not the virus itself thats why the tests werent coming back positive as i lay on my deathbed i gave in and dropped another 60 on two more test kits bringing my total up to 6 i wasnt going to need the money when i was dead after all i took the first one 4 months after the initial infection and it came back negative not to my surprise this was more of an addiction than anything now i didnt really care about the result so much as the process 2 months later my aids had subsided a bit i took the second test for shits and giggles and it came back negative i felt like i had been trapped on a roller coaster for the past 6 months i had developed severe generalized anxiety alongside my hivaids infection to the point where i couldnt even drive to the grocery store without having an allout panic attack then things got better i told myself that i could beat this disease i just needed to take care of myself i started eating healthier forcing myself onto a better sleep schedule and even moderately exercising then something amazing happened my aids started to rapidly subside within a week i had regressed from terminal aids patient to a runofthemill hiv patient but i was able to cure myself of the hiv too all in all two weeks after i set my mind to it i had beaten this debilitating disease to a pulp i felt amazing for the first time in over a year i had a new life new possibilities new energy and drive i was going to conquer my dreams now no longer my illnesses and i did pretty damned good until i discovered that i had a congenital heart defect you know the story from there i sunk down down down then i saw a doctor had a battery of tests was told i was healthy as an ox and began to rebound here i am today 3 months after surviving the heart disease this week i learned i have ms i am not looking forward to this fight but i have confidence that i can beat this diseases ass too today i was diagnosed with another disorder as well its called health anxiety and this is the one im not going to fuck around with overall it is one of the most debilitating diseases imaginable it can turn a person with boundless potential into a sickly shell of their former selves and the worst part this one is not imaginary,pre-pandemic

so tomorrow im celebrating 6 years of continuous sobriety this is the strangest anniversary ive had so far and i really want to talk a little bit about emotional sobriety for a minute and the ridiculous pressure that people in recovery sometimes put on themselves to act their age this may be the longest period of time that ive been away from a drink but this past year has been the most challenging year ive experienced so far and i have felt closer to a drink than i ever have in previous years i am not sharing this for congratulations or for attention i was not planning to acknowledge my anniversary publicly at all this year actually because i always feel kind of weird about doing that but as i was journaling today i somehow ended up writing a novel about it so here we are this is actually really embarrassing and i acknowledge that i am completely blowing up my own spot on the internet to people that i do not know and that do not have the first clue about my past because ive been very careful to protect it but i feel like this is also important im attempting to be vulnerable right now because brene brown says vulnerability is a good thing and brene brown is bae but im also terrified of judgment i really hope this doesnt come off as preachy or egotistical because that is not me at all im putting myself on blast because if theres anyone out there right now who feels the way i felt this year hopefully something i say might be helpful to them hopefully they dont drink this year has been very hard to say the least i work full time during the day and have class 4 nights a week some days until 10 im tired overworked overwhelmed broke my own fault and pretty depressed most of the time im too busy to adequately take care of myself most days im really struggling to consistently eat well sleep enough get to the gym and be of service in any capacity i only get to one or two meetings a week if that and im not sponsoring anybody because i dont have time i started smoking again and really want to stop but you know how that goes im also having a hard time being present in my relationships i might be there physically but emotionally i am miles away i wake up every day and i feel trapped every time i come up for air another random wave that i didnt see coming knocks me out and fills my lungs with metaphorical water some days i literally feel like i cant breathe like there is just this invisible weight coming down on my chest and crushing me hour after hour day after day its insufferable at times there are brief reprieves but generally its been rough i promise ill get to the hope soon as the result of being too tired too busy or lets be honest too unwilling to work on myself during this period ive watched my general emotional state slowly decline and to be frank ive thought about drinking a lot if someone randomly brings up alcohol in conversation lately i actually start to disassociate right in front of them they are still talking to me about whatever but my mind is somewhere else trying to remember what alcohol feels like when it first hits your stomach ive felt extreme jealously toward coworkers of mine who go to happy hour after work or go home after a long day and drink a glass of wine on the couch or in the bath to unwind ive scrolled through instagram stories of friends drinking paused them and felt myself get really uncomfortable as i started to imagine what their drinks taste like i felt jealousy toward my family members who were all drinking white claw and enjoying our beach house weekend last month while i was drinking la croix i often sit and wonder what it might be like to sit around a dinner table with my friends eating good food and drinking good wine i got sober at 19 and never got to experience what thats like ive never had one glass of good wine in my life franzia and barefoot foreverlt3 and i never got to try a white claw gah ive been finding myself feeling like im missing out on something recently and this makes me really sad and really angry all the time especially because i know and 100 understand that this is insane thinking that im missing actual nothing and that drinking will never improve my situation ive done enough drinking for one lifetime but this is just the reality of what alcoholism and recovery looks like for me sometimes for the last week or so as my anniversary has gotten closer ive been reflecting on the last year and ive felt incredible shame and guilt about this although ive been physically sober for a while now my brain overwhelmed by these feelings of failure for missing the mark on self care and for experiencing this recurring obsession about alcohol again has told me that i dont deserve to celebrate this milestone i know this shit sounds wild because i am definitely physically sober but in my brain its 100 real and very intense if you know you know my boyfriend asked me if i wanted to do anything for my anniversary and i basically shrugged and said no because i just didnt want to make a thing about it this year it all felt wrong ive been talking about this to those who are close to me and the more i share about it the more i begin to realize that nothing about this experience is a failure ive gone through this before in recovery but never to the extent that i am right now and thats ok it doesnt mean that im doing it wrong that im doomed to relapse or that theres something wrong with me its just part of the process right now things are challenging at the moment for sure but things are also beautiful and transformative i really dont know shit at the end of the day but if theres one thing i do know its that everything is temporary and these feelings will pass nothing that im going through right now is bad and not one single thing that i am doing at the moment would even be possible for the me of 6 years ago so thats pretty cool everything im facing right now is a gift and is the direct result of a life ive worked so hard for a life ive been given a second chance to live a life i legit almost lost almost 9 years ago i dropped out of high school because my addiction took over my life and i couldnt face failing i moved to florida to run away from the mess that i made back home i was so ashamed and humiliated about who i was and everything id done 8 years ago the doctor told me my liver enzymes were too high at age 18 7 years ago i could not get through one day without putting a substance into my body i couldnt even take a shower sometimes because i was so sick 7 years ago i could barely hold a job even working for my dad slinging ice cream 7 years ago i quit college 6 years ago i had already been to 3 rehabs and 5 detoxes within a 3 year period 6 years ago after getting arrested i told a co in jail to go fuck themselves and lost my license for a year 6 years ago i was sent to the er in an ambulance on 2 separate occasions in less than 90 days 6 years ago i almost lost my life in a back alley next to a dumpster so 6 years ago i made a decision i decided that alcohol would no longer be my master no matter how hard life got or how unbearable my feelings became i made a decision not to to drink or use drugs no matter what one day at a time and ive made that decision for 2190 days in a row now something that ive learned these last few years is that recovery is not linear and anyone who tells you that or who makes you feel like sobriety is nothing but peace and serenity all the time is a fucking douchebag everything is always changing and shifting the only constant in my life is not drinking emotional ups and downs are still normal for me and ive had to learn how to become malleable and how to experience intense emotions without running away or letting them consume me they way they used to maybe your experience in sobriety is or will be different than mine but my recovery so far has been littered with periods of really intense darkness followed by periods of pure happiness and peace its always worth it though and im grateful every day life did not suddenly become easy when i got sober like i thought it would maybe for a little while my pink cloud probably lasted a year or two but ive learned that the world and the people in it do not owe me anything as time goes on i still feel pain regularly i still have bad days i still randomly burst into tears in my car sometimes when a song comes on that brings up past trauma and im still afraid all the fucking time no matter how many fears i face along the way what has changed is my ability to stand my ground and experience everything good or bad that life has to offer i do not run you may be confused about why i would day dream about something as innocuous as drinking wine around a table with my friends when i just revealed that i overdosed on a literal curb next to an actual dumpster 6 years ago because that is one wide margin of delusion but addiction is a subtle foe my addiction may sound like me and think like me but its something else entirely its like a virus that waits patiently for the perfect opportunity to strike it will plant an unrealistic image in my head when im tired weak and vulnerable and like a virus it disguises itself as part of me so that ill let it slip past my defenses undetected the idea will take root and grow and meander through all of the dark corners of my mind like a vine latching onto my insecurities and fears and refusing to let go it tells me it will be different this time it tries to convince me that i was just a dumb kid with a lot of trauma and no coping skills but now im a grown ass adult ive been to therapy and god dammit i deserve a glass of wine after a hard day i was ashamed to admit that i had been feeling this way to my support group because well i shouldnt still feel this way with 6 years of sobriety whatever the fuck that means before getting sober i always had this misconception that someone with a year or more of sobriety had it all figured out most of us feel this way in the beginning i thought they were spiritual giants and i put them up on pedestals i honestly thought they were better than me i truly hope nobody ever feels that way about me the longer ive been sober the less sober time actually matters in the grand scheme there is no golden year or amount of time that we reach and the growth just stops the journey doesnt just end and im grateful for that the journey is what i signed up for in the day is where life happens for me and more and more thats where i try to stay even though im sober i can still be a piece of shit sometimes im still mean for no reason some days i experience rage envy and hatred im so selfish impatient impulsive and i cant make good financial decisions at all most of the time i still have to make amends when im wrong which happens to be a lot and i am constantly beating myself up for not meeting my own unreasonable standards and expectations but i am also getting better i am often kind generous hardworking loving ambitious adventurous passionate thoughtful and honest i own my shit today and i take responsibility for my actions sobriety has given me the ability to take an honest appraisal of myself and to love myself for not just my great qualities but also for all of my faults and flaws as well with each year that passes i learn more about what it truly means to love yourself and to love others sobriety has given me the opportunity to know myself to know who i am at my core and not shy away or crawl out of my skin when things are hard to look at sobriety has given me every single good thing that i have in my life today it has given me the ability to see others and to let them see me to love unconditionally in a healthy independent way and to experience the other side of true hopelessness but most of all sobriety has given me a choice i never had that before and i refuse to give that up for the delusion of drinking one glass of wine on the couch while watching ghost adventures on a thursday night because 1 thats dumb and 2 the reality of that delusion is as follows me two bottles of gas station wine deep wandering around in the dark screaming at ghosts to come fight me so if any of my sober peeps feel this way right now especially my young friends its ok if your time in sobriety is not an accurate measure of what you feel your character or your life should reflect at this point i know that we all know this to some extent but a lot of us still feel shame when it happens to us and we still try to hide it by putting on an act that everything is fine and if youre newly sober or wanting to get sober please dont let anything ive said deter you ive only made one good choice in my life and that was getting sober every other good choice that followed was just the result its ok to be honest when we feel like weve missed the mark its ok to be vulnerable about this its ok to let people see the truth of what recovery looks like sometimes its ok if youre not ok right now we still deserve to celebrate grateful for today love yall,pre-pandemic

i guess most people feel off some days a little dizzy or weak or just strange when i have these days i completely lose it today was one of those days i couldnt really put my finger on what was wrong with me if anyone had asked i wouldnt have been able to point to something specific so instead of feeling off i felt like i was dying like this is the first stage of my body completely breaking down anybody else have something similar,pre-pandemic
not because it was fun because it wasnt being a teenager fucking sucked but it was okay that i was crazy it was okay that i was moody that i was passionate and extreme and depressed and elated if i quit my shitty waitressing job and got a new shitty retail job every few months or ran off to the beach on a whim it was okay it was normal it was just what kids do it was just a phase i was spontaneous but now ill be 30 in a few years and its not cute anymore its not mysterious or quirky or fun its not normal its destructive and terrifying and exhausting and im suffering i cant get it together is this how my life will be is this all i have to look forward to my whole life is not ahead of me it wont all be okay if i fuck everything up im tired of trying im tired of no one getting it im tired of not being able to name my illness because people dont understand it im tired of saying that im sick when what i really mean is im dying but today i survived im tired of overhearing how people really feel about bipolar when they arent being pc im tired that i have to hide and change a piece of myself to fit into a mold that nobody likes in the first place im tired of them trying to take away my happy of calling it bad or wrong im tired of being something that needs to be fixed im just tired,pre-pandemic

hi everyone this will be a long post but i think it will also be a helpful one for those of you who are struggling to cope or have not yet had access to cbt i am not a therapist nor am i attempting to counsel however i have learned some strategies in therapy that are slowly helping me and i thought for those who have not heard these perhaps they could be of use id like to start by saying that i do not subscribe to this sub i did for a while and i found that it actually fed my health anxiety constantly seeing posts by people who were seeking reassurance would always put a new and frightening illness on my radar so now i occasionally check back when i am in a deep state of anxiety the key difference however between checking then and checking now is what im looking for when i used to look at the sub it was because i too was seeking reassurance i wanted to know what others were struggling with if my symptoms matched up with other peoples symptoms and if i discovered a new ailment along the way well then great i could add another to the long list of things that would kill be before i turned 25 next april when i look at this sub now however i dont look to the posts i look to the comments i am not seeking reassurance but rather evidence in cbt my therapist has been working with me on the importance of building evidence both for and against the disease i am concerned about at that moment i give you an example a snapshot of me right now age 24 gender male medical history nothing significant family history bowel cancer and melanoma however these are not relevant to my current state of anxiety current symptoms aching pain in my left leg for the last 6 weeks am now getting pain in both legs on alternating days muscle twitches fasciculations in both legs primarily above the knee but all over and in other areas of my body slight weakness in my sore legs and my left arm testingtreatment i have had done regarding these symptoms lumbar mri clear with minor wear and tear xray left leg awaiting results regular physiotherapy visits treating for referred pain from back what im afraid of alsmndms bone cancer for a couple of weeks i was a mess i was having panic attacks that i had alsmnd my muscle twitches were going haywire i couldnt sleep i was getting tingles down my leg and left arm then i started to actually pay attention to my therapist and some helpful commentors on this sub below is what my evidence for and against all of these things looks like evidence that i do have als i have muscle twitches which is a symptom of als muscular pain is sometimes a symptom of als i feel some minor weakness but nothing that stops me walking or grasping things in my sore legs and arm evidence that i do not have als i am 24 years old most cases of this disease occur in people over 40 and often closer to 60 i have no family history while most cases of als occur in people with no family history almost all cases in people below 30 or 40 are familial related muscle twitches while there are exceptions as with anything are usually a later stage symptom of the disease there is very little medical study into muscle twitches because they are considered to be of little medical significance in other words they are so common and have hundreds of causes plus hundreds more that doctors likely do not know about all of which are far more likely than als this symptom alone means little to nothing a quote i saw online but cannot remember where said remember muscle twitches are common als is not the prevalence of als is about 1 or 2 in 100 000 thats only between 10 and 20 in every 1 000 000 or between 100 and 200 in every 20 000 000 people those numbers are pretty good generally before other symptoms people will experience clinical weakness in their limbs ie unable to walk properly unable to hold a mug not just tripping minor losses in dexterity or even minor foot draggingtripping i have been clumsy my entire life its a running joke between my girlfriend and i about how clumsy i am the weakness and soreness in my left arm is probably from a tendinitis injury i have struggled with on and off for the last 5 years evidence that i do have bone cancer my legs hurt evidence that i do not have bone cancer i had a lumbar mri come back clean meaning nothing in lymphatic system nothing in my spinal column no tumours causing referred pain no family history i have had an xray and while i do not yet have the results if they come back negative thats about as conclusive as you can get conclusion all we need to do is look at the evidence i probably dont have als or bone cancer its far more likely that i have some mechanical fault in my legs or a muscular issue that will probably resolve with some physiotherapy true there are no absolutes in life true i could have one of these horrible diseases nobody on planet earth can guarantee i or anybody else doesnt but the statistical likelihood of me having these ailments is so minuscule that it isnt even worth worrying about and i know telling a person with health anxiety not to worry about health is like telling a dog not to smell another dogs butt and id be lying if i said this was a cure for my anxiety it isnt i still have low days and i still have weak moments but what this has helped with is coping on a daytoday basis i wont tell you not to google because i know that wont stop you but i will say a limit the amount you do and b if you do google dont just search symptoms and match yours to whatever horrible thing comes up instead look for evidence look for statistics in your age bracket look for ties to family history and hereditary links and most of all remind yourself that its okay to get anxious but it isnt okay to let that anxiety rule over you and ruin your day week month or existence i hope this was helpful for those who had time to read it,pre-pandemic

honestly this happened to me if you read my posts youll know im mostly recovered from having panic attacks and worrying about everything 6 months without a major panic attack woohoo ive come a long way with keeping on top of my diet exercising regularly and forcing myself to be social with family and friends but ive been crazy happy the last couple of days due to finally quitting a job that made me miserable feeling confident and happy to be social and chat more to friends im not used to feeling anymore than content for a few hours so to feel ecstatic for a few days made me feel like i was going crazy haha it goes to show im not used to any emotions in their extremes including happiness i feel like true comfort is being in a meh mood after talking to a therapist in the past about this its actually very common chronic anxiety disorders basically put all your energy into coping with one extreme emotion and when you recover it sometimes unveils a tendency to feel very uncomfortable with emotions you did not previously express like anger confidence and happiness and was actually a trigger for one of my relapses i was convinced i was an aggressive person that was dangerous because in around 10 years of my youth i did not express anger not because it was repressed but because anxiety was my default reaction to everything im not an angry person and after a lot of cbt ive come to accept all emotions that make us unique and often very confused people im allowed to be happy im allowed to be angry and anxiety is ok in small doses too,pre-pandemic

yesterday it was a bad surf session triggered by comparing my performance with others today it was because the waves were too big for me to ride i told myself i was lucky to even have the time and opportunity to surf it eventually gets better with conscious effort to change my perspective but then some other small inconvenience comes up and restarts the cycle i want a technique to make it not start in the first place i dont want to die right now but i cant stop thinking how comfortable it would be to give up i hate myself when i feel sorry for myself which results in this crazy internal struggle which overwhelms me and makes me want to give up any help will be appreciated thanks,pre-pandemic
im 20 and was diagnosed bp2 by a free therapist at my university when i was 18 i have health insurance through my parents but they dont believe in mental health so i could never seek real treatment even hippa doesnt apply because my bills and stuff would still have been sent to their house and there was no way for me to change the billing address so ive been cycling pretty much non stop for 2 years i gave up hope of ever being able to be on medication or receive real therapy this whole mess has caused me to be so isolated my whole first two years of college receive horrible grades etc a few months ago during a horrible depressive episode i emailed my schools student support services and asked if there was anyway i would qualify for a grant for the student health care its 2000 a year ontop of a 36000 tuition and im paying for my own school so there was no way i could afford it i explained i had been diagnosed bipolar and was barely coping i didnt hear back from them for months so i kinda forgot about it well today i got an email they gave me a full grant to cover it for the rest of my time in school so i have free health insurance now allowing me to get a real therapist psychiatrist and even go to a normal doctor for free i cant even express how crazy this is i literally cried with joy when i got the email i was sooo so hopeless and giving up on all my dreams and now i have a way to get healthy again and i have no one to tell in real life,pre-pandemic

it really bothers me that people talk about mental health awareness but they just talk about anxiety depression or whatever but not psychosis or schizophrenia when thats an illness that can destroy whoevers life im not saying depression or anxiety are not important but come on psychotic illnesses are pretty serious and affect more people than what everyone thinks this situation should really change if we actually want to create authentic mental health awareness,pre-pandemic

we forget things that we genuinely care about hell we forget about things that we ourselves are interested in theres no controlling who it happens to or what its about if it can be remembered it can also be forgotten meds dont give us perfect memory dont shame yourself for forgetting it happens a lot do the best that you can to resolve the problem and make the best of it edit 1 holy shit this blew up im glad i was a source of much needed validation of your experiences and reality guys also just a fun note this post was inspired by the constant misunderstanding that neurotypical people seem to have about us when it comes to remembering they dont realize that our brains just refuse to recall information regardless of the time span between receiving it and trying to recall it my wife was unfortunately one of these people until i just showed her this post and the comments you guys helped my wife understand whats really going on she said she wont ever get mad at me for forgetting and to remind her of this post when she does thank you guys for that thanks for the silver you know who you are,pre-pandemic

i am 26 and have been through a ton of medical things ive been dealing with it for 15 years and only started to feel the trauma symptoms about 2 years ago because i was so strong for as long as i was people tend to not believe that my issues are as bad as they are i am in counseling and on many psych meds to help but it is so easy for me to get set back because my medical problem is lifelong and i am at the hospital or other doctor appointments at least once a week x200b how do i start to ease those who dont believe me into realizing just how deep rooted my problems are and that ptsd is not just for those who have fought in wars,pre-pandemic
okay so i graduated university my gpa isnt stellar as adhd did interfere with my ability to memorize boring information and spit it back out onto a piece of paper one area where i was strong in was finance and accounting math in general really i am currently in the process of applying for jobs and finding it somewhat difficult to get taken seriously because of my lower gpa 26 overall 335 accounting gpa my question is rather than explain it from the view of oh adhd interfered with my ability to memorize hence the low marks has anyone actually came out and said in a application that one of their main strengths is the fact theyre diagnosed with adhd i mean personally i think adhd is a gift from god we have a powerful brain that sometimes gets a little carried away i know in some positions it actually gives me a competitive edge sales for instance i am pretty certain that mentioning a bold statement like that will make you stand out however i dont know if the person on the other end will see it the same way i see it endrant tl dr i have adhd i believe its a strength to me more so than a weakness would it be smart to throw a statement on my application cover letter saying that it is something valuable i can bring to the table,pre-pandemic
ive always suffered from severe crippling social anxiety which has always made it very difficult for me to ask for help because the simple task of making a phone call to make an appointment is just something i cant do its now been a little over 2 months that ive been persuaded that i had adhd and i selfmedicated vyvanse using my friends prescription for a little over 3 weeks until i got a prescription of my own a few weeks ago i was worried i wasnt gonna be taken seriously by admitting using adhd medication prior to getting a diagnosis and it was really stressful for me to admit it because i was afraid they wouldnt take me for an appointment ive read a lot about the subject on the internet and many people recommended not telling your doctor about it because it would make you seem like you are seeking drugs but since i was really trying to find solutions and i really wasnt going there just for a prescription i told the clinic before the first appointment that i was currently using vyvanse and to my surprise they were really happy and told me that they see that everyday and that it wasnt a reason to not take me in charge on the contrary it would help the doctor decide which medication to prescribe in the case that a diagnosis was made since i received my diagnosis my mom has an appointment with the same doctor because i am 100 positive that i got it from her and my sister made an appointment with her own doctor for herself and her son because both have lots of symptoms as well and i feel like an hero of some sort if my godson whos only turning 6 this week have it and can be treated now and not only realize somethings wrong before his lifes already fucked up im an happy man in my case if i hadnt been selfmedicating my anxiety would have won me over and id still be where i was 2 months ago and being honest about it to my doctor has been the best thing ive done in the whole process if youve been wondering if you should tell or not your doctor about using adhd meds dont listen to the other people telling you otherwise and do it,pre-pandemic

ive been dealing with bipolar 2 for a loooooooong time i have it mostly under control therapy meds support system selfawareness but im one of those whose hypomanic and depressive cycles are seasonally aligned ie i have hypomania every april and october like clockwork that lasts 6 weeks and moves back into depressive for the last week ive been feeling the hypomania calming and the depressive state kind of spreading out like water if you know what i mean not the worst thing in the world i welcome being able toneeding to sleep more than 5hrs a night and stopping with the stupid impulsive dumb ideas and decisions the amount of money ive spent on clothes and home decor the last month ugh but the headaches and the helpless feelings lately as i switch have really gotten me down i hate the depressive episodes and feeling it coming along is like watching a train coming at me in very slow motion but my feet are nailed to the rails i do all of the regular things to make these episodes less like clean eating exercise cut down on alcohol force myself to keep a social calendar listen to my body etc but i guess i just needed to commiserate with my fellow bpiis for a minute it can be a lonely disorder and other people dont get it unless they experience it too fellow friends i just needed some virtual hugs today strength to all of us just doing our thing every day to get by,pre-pandemic
any other quiet borderlines here i feel like nearly all the rage is directed inward at myself so much that a lot of people im close to will never know just how bad i can get i dont usually explode at people because im too afraid of damaging relationships so i let people walk all over me unintentionally i just isolate myself when im upset and self harm i know better done dbt twice but im not feeling mentally together enough to fight this i also feel like im extremely boring and too socially awkward and people become disinterested really quickly at times i really question whether i have bpd or just a really emotionally unstable flavour of adhd anyone else feel like this edit also hopefully this isnt breaking any rules but if anyone here wants to dm me im always looking for peoplel to chat with,pre-pandemic
i was diagnosed with adhd when i was 10 over 14 years ago i remember when the doctor told my mom i would very likely heavily underperform academically i remember my mom tearing up when we left the doctors office i can so vividly recall what i thought at that moment nobody makes my mama cry i dont know what this adhd thingy is but i will beat the shit out of it and so my war against it started the next week consisted of me trying to get all the information i could about adhd online it was very hard as every single thing i read i could relate to this is me this is how i always act i do really have this adhd thingy i wanted to deny it so badly my parents are the best they got me started in the medication very early on went to a shrink until i was 15 which helped me a lot even though my parents were very understanding they never let adhd be an excuse for my fuck ups which might sound harsh but it just went very well with my fight it mentality for the next couple years i tried to do all the things that adhd would make hard to do and realized that i could not win on all fronts so i decided to focus on an specific aspect of adhd to fight the academic underperformance and so i tried to get the best scores make friends with the smartest people at school etc getting good marks made me feel validated and even more importantly it made me feel that even though i was handicapped i could do better than normal people if i tried hard enough fast foward 5 years i was 17 and got the 3rd best scores in the whole school it felt so good it feels so good to prove people wrong still something very important that i learned during those years is that you cant really win against adhd it never goes away the best you can do is accept it live with it control it i could keep babbling about myself but what i am trying to convey is that what worked for me was 1 i saw adhd as a challenge not an excuse i could hide behind not as reason as to why people should pity me as i am not a victim 2 no one should ever expect less of me because i have adhd it doesnt define me it doesnt control me the older i got the more i tired to not let people know i had adhd as that would give me a excuse to hide behind in case i fucked up 3 do not deny medication it exists for a reason it helps however dont be overly dependent on it the more situations you can handle without medication the more you will learn to control it 4 you are gonna fuck up you are gonna be annoying sometimes some people are gonna be rude to you as most people have no obligation not patience to deal with us when we go into overdrive the more you understand that less offended you will feel when they tell you to chill out some stuff is gonna be tough but you gotta love yourself if you dont then work hard to be a person you can love a person you can be proud about pd english is not my native language so please let me know if i got anything wrong good riddance everyone d,pre-pandemic

there have been times where ive frantically googled the symptoms for everything from ms to brain tumors to ruptured ovarian cysts and shortly afterwards i would see an ad or an article about something related to it nearby gynecologists cancer centers etc but since ive stopped doing that i dont see them as much anymore its been really helpful in taming my anxieties googling something once every so often doesnt affect the algorithm too much i dont think but when youre a chronic symptomchecker like i used to be triggering ads definitely start becoming more prevalent so resist the keyboard and just breathe,pre-pandemic
i havent been able to find much information about this online so im reaching out to this community i have sexual trauma from a couple years ago and it has been getting worse recently one of the worst symptoms is that when my boyfriend touches me i just cant handle it sometimes it doesnt even have to be in a sexual way even if were just cuddling ill suddenly become aware of his hands on me and i have this feeling thats hard to describe its an awful combination of disgust and anger i can still feel it after he stops and moves away from me and it makes me want to rip my skin off in that area it makes me feel bad because hes always respectful of my boundaries and i trust him completely but these episodes still happen randomly sometimes they last for a full day after it happens and its hard for me to even take a shower because being naked makes me uncomfortable even if its just me by myself i have obsessive thoughts about the trauma that are so vivid i can almost feel it happening again i feel really weird about it and the fact that i havent been able to find anything online makes me feel worse can anyone relate thanks,pre-pandemic
a few years ago i joined this sub when i was dealing with horrible health anxiety everything you guys are fearing stroke aneurism cancer infection i also feared during the summer of 2017 my fears consumed me i spent all day googling symptoms shaking crying hyperventilating being mistrustful of doctors joining online communities specific to vague illnesses trying weird diets i did it all and during that time a prescription bottle sat in my medicine cabinet untouched for four months i had a prescription of 10mg of lexapro that i was scared to take like many of you taking medications scared me one day im not exactly sure what went through my mind but i just got sick of it i got sick of sleepless nights and spending all day home cleaning the germs out of my house i was over being consumed by my fear of death at only 21 i popped a pill in my mouth and never looked back since that day in september 2017 i never had another panic attack or thoughts of health anxiety again i ended up cutting my pills in half and to this day i still only take 5mg of lexapro everyday because of that medication i got through nursing school and as a nurse i see what truly sick people really look like im not saying that to diminish anyones fears or feelings but i wish i could have seen just how sick people can be people with cancer and infections are so sickly having an awareness of this then would have been comforting to me so i hope it can bring comfort to you too youre not sick youre just anxious and thats okay theres help available for you too you can get through this one way or another medication is not the only route but its the route i took that saved me good luck,pre-pandemic
a lot of people toss the term bipolar arounds like its nothing they think that because theyve had something uncomfortable happen and it changes their mood into an ugly one then someone comes and brightens their day that theyre bipolar having a bad day then it turns into a good does not make you bipolar life fucking sucks sometimes and sometimes youre sad sometimes youre happy but that doesnt make you bipolar living with bipolar disorder is so much more than that its looking at something and experiencing love as youve never felt before its looking at the shade of colors in the trees and the flowers looking at how vibrant everything is sometimes you can even fucking feel the glow of the colors at least i do feeling like you can do anything in the world like youre unstoppable you begin to take on so many projects because your energy feels like it comes from the source and it feels great honestly you never want it to end you hardly need any sleep and you have an altruistic attitude towards everything youve been feeling like this for weeks now you have the most positive attitude ever then when it hits it fucking hits and it fucking hits hard the depression that follows is completely debilitating its obstacle after obstacle like youre just barricaded in your depression and theres not a way out there are times where you dont even want to get out of bed it consumes you you lay there thinking about how everything is miserable and you feel like youre not good enough you just want to be crossed out you want to be gone asleep you build up these walls these barriers that are hard to tear down no matter how hard you try you cant break them down and it feels like theyre going to cave burying you in its stones of negativity living with bipolar disorder is more than just having mood swings its feeling like youre the best version of yourself and you really vibe with it and so does everyone else around you only to crash so hard that you want to die and being forgotten because you arent who you used to be anymore but people pick up on it because you do it in cycles it starts becoming predictable and youre like a ticking time bomb,pre-pandemic

anxiety is being invited to a party months prior getting up washing 3x dressing going to the shop taking your time to buy the most expensive cake and prosecco going to the venue getting through the first set of doorsthen freaking out and leaving without seeing anyone then calling a friend getting her to stop by yours before she gets there to take your gift and lie for you by saying i had to work night shift im a nurse then spending the evening beating yourself up for missing yet another event ruminating on what theyre doing what theyre talking about and the memories theyre making without you knowing its just a matter of time till everyone finally stops inviting you to things then of course walking home leaves you even more freaked because your ptsd makes you jump at every loud noise out there and its fireworks season anxiety is a thief of experience,pre-pandemic

so last month i was able to take my prescribed 40mg in a matter of 2 hours and only feel effects for 4 hours i had to take a week long break due to dr mixups and delays with my prescription i slept for 15 hours a day and eating constantly because i felt insatiable nothing made me feel like i ate anything i week was utter shit now i am at the same point i was last month where my medication is only lasting 4 hours and 40mg feels like 20mg used to be but with a shorter duration i am crashing way too soon in the day around lunch time for most people i felt amazing and started turning my life around when i started treatment again after that prescription mixup 3 weeks ago i also only needed 30mg to get the desired effects for the day i know what im experiencing is a tolerance related issue and not anything ph related because i know what to do in regards to that i am dreading taking a break my days are totally shit when im off my medication i have no energy no motivation and no interest in things when i am not on my meds i was always like this even before i started treatment as well as when i was off it during that week break what do you guys think i should do about this take a day off every week if able to slow the tolerance increase and immediately take a day off and see how that changes things before taking a longer break or immediately take a few days to a week break and return to 1 day break every week and just do this every time my tolerance does this again i know people stay on the same dose for years without increasing their dose but personally that isnt working for me i have been on adderall for 3 months now and this has happened more often then coincidence edit formatting and wording fixed for readability update 1216 i took a day off and took a normal dose of dxm to help with tolerance a noticeable improvement and something i plan on doing maybe once a week in addition to my magnesium at night to help keep my tolerance down,pre-pandemic

when i see people trivializing mental disorders it makes my blood boil especially when it is adhd because it hits so close to home nobody not even my parents could ever understand what is wrong with me i was a bright boy but i simply could not focus for the life of me and it made me feel so bad about myself because i truly wanted more from my life i remember when i asked people for advice about should i take medications to treat my adhd everyone would keep telling me not to do it how those drugs are going to fry my brain and il end up a meth addict or crazy and how when they have trouble doing something they just breathe or play some music or go for a walk and rest and for a long time i really tried doing everything but i failed 2 years in university and that was the final straw i told myself i might become insane or fry my brain completely by the time im 40 but i would rather live 10 years in control than live a 100 being nothing more than just an observer in my life ive been on adderall for 2 years now and only after taking it have i realized just how much i have suffered because of my disease it took me so long to be able to forgive myself for all my failiures i even became a much better driver before i could not focus on anything and it took me so long to get my drivers licence and my instructor would always complain that i dont focus and i always felt bad and stupid i am a much safer driver now tldr adhd is absolutely lifedestroying disease and i wonder just how many doctors and engineers the wold has lost because their potential was cut due to adhd,pre-pandemic

about a year ago and more so in the last six months ive refound religion i found focusing on keeping god and his will on the forefront of my mind has helped me with my meds reduce the time i waste and make chores easier the love for my so also helps religion has helped me the most by far with kicking a porn habit i was addicted both physically and emotionally religion helped to end the emotional component by filling the hole in my soul and by softly minimizing my over inflated ego the porn habit had exacerbated the adhd does anyone have similar stories edit i didnt post this in ratheism i dont object to atheism science nor philosophy can firmly and scientifically deny or confirm the existence of a god or divinity only fundamentalist atheism such as what atticusmas is advocating i also object theologically and depending on how its practiced personally to fundamentalist christianity the religious thoughts i am specifically referencing is a mix of christian orthodoxy with some roman catholic and anglican speakers and buddhist taoist and classical philosophical thinkers included moderate islamic speakers concerning the islamic science of sufism started my soul searching and my attempt at humility before god there are humble saints and arrogant jerks in each religion the humbles almost always have gems of truth to share i understand the odd oppositional defiant disorder aspect of adhd as well as the emotional aloofness seen with many adhders including myself both lend to atheism but if egotism and materialism are set aside religious practice and is easily viewed as a true holistic and peaceful answer to life,pre-pandemic
hey again ive been part of this community for the past few months now and ive definitely had my ups and downs when it comes to health anxiety for the past few months its been the fear of breast cancer for me 21 years old and male go do the math on that one despite numerous tests and reassurances from doctors but there was something ive always noticed when browsing this sub and im pretty sure a lot of you have had the same experience id scroll down the sub looking for people with similar fears and similar symptoms hoping to find someone who can provide some form of reassurance however as id scroll id see other people having their own issues either related or not related to my own and id always have the same exact thought when looking at them oh they cant possibly be sick im the one with the illness or their anxiety is just causing their symptoms but my symptoms are real and im pretty sure a lot of you had thought the same exact thing we always think were the exception the 0000001 the unlucky ones but i want you to ask yourself something why why do you think like that why are you the medical anomaly i asked myself the same question and genuinely i couldnt come up with a decent answer but thats what health anxiety does it isolates you it makes you feel as if youre alone when youre not because chances are about a million people out there are also worried about the same symptoms you are and how many of those people do you genuinely think are really sick so again ask yourself why do you think youre the exception why are you somehow the unluckiest person in the world that you have every illness known to man,pre-pandemic

i think we all agree that we worry too much about what if and dont put enough stock into what is case in point me right now i started a few weeks ago with this feeling like i needed to pee all the time saw my doctor he did a couple tests nothing this had happened a few months ago same result he said it was likely just a stress reaction or irritation from the balanitis i was diagnosed with a couple weeks prior and there was nothing to be concerned about it mostly went away for a week or so i had my annual physical 3 weeks ago and my doctor did a full workup all the blood tests urine tests std panel the whole shebang nothing comes up aside from some elevated cholesterol not a new concern he does a physical examination as well and tells me youre a healthy person hearing that helped until it didnt fast forward a week this weird urinary frequency is back along with lower back and hip tightness and tenderness in the whole area this includes the bladder which freaks me out i also get a recurring case of balanitis doctor gives me a cream its clearing up but then i had the thought what if this is a kidney infection or something bam my mid back starts acting up this ignores the fact that my reflux is back likely because of stress and drinking coffee again which ive stopped and that i have no fever fatigue or any other signs of illness i hate this everything ive just described is something ive dealt with before and ended up being nothing remotely serious lower back pelvic and hip discomfort posture is bad and its pulling my hips in a direction they shouldnt go mid back pain reflux and gas i used to be on nexium for this and when i slouch thats right where i end up rounding my back urinary frequency went away quickly without any fuss but now its happening all at once and my mind is racing and i hate all of it the worst part is that none of it is even all that bad and the pains seem to come and go im living pretty normally and when im busy or my mind is occupied i dont even notice a lot of this but here i am afraid i have a kidney or bladder problem when i have multiple explanations on why that isnt true i apologize for that leading nowhere but i just needed to rant i was doing pretty well until last month and now in a few weeks i feel like ive totally disintegrated,pre-pandemic

i love to be reassured that im wanted and whats a better way to show that than sharing something as intimate as sex because of that ill be the most romantic and dtf person youve ever met right up until were about to get down to business then i feel like ive accomplished my goal and my mind is done with the whole situation this has always been a frustrating issue for myself and my partners but im just not into sex past the threshold of knowing its going to happen it doesnt feel particularly good which most of the time means im pushing rope after a minute or two and soon ends up becoming a chore i got what i wanted proof that i was worth something to you the moment it got steamy the next thirty minutes are going to be disappointing for both of us,pre-pandemic

my health anxiety is weird in that i dont really fear any specific illness instead i worry about dying of an unknownundiagnosed condition i worry specifically that my consciousness is about to end that im beginning the process of passing out and im never going to wake up i primarily get intense feelings of impending doom which leave me paralysed with fear often unable to do anything but lie down in bed and close my eyes in the past i used to go to the hospital a lot and beg the doctors not to let me die but now i at least have the courage to just freak out at home the impending feelings of doom are so intense they leave me shaking and feeling cold sometimes while huddled in bed in the midst of a panic attack i even involuntarily shake and yell out things to myself like please i dont want to die like the fear of death is so strong i actually blurt things out reflexively without being able to control it this is happening to me basically every day now and leading me to spend increasing amounts of time just lying down at home when i try and socialise im often distracted from the conversation by thoughts im about to die i spend about 80 of my life fixated on these horrible thoughts aboht dying and about 1020 of my life experiencing this intense feeling of doom i need help i dont want to live like this any more has anyone felt this way or been in a similar situation is there anything i should try to help myself,pre-pandemic

hypochondria is the worst thing to ever happen to me everyday im crippled by it i guess i just wanted to make a list of all the worst things i go through as a hypochondriac 1 seeing healthy people and wishing you were like them even though you probably are healthy but your brain is telling you youre not 2 changing daily routines based off the health issue you think you have at the time 3 changing your entire diet to become healthier for me it has been limiting carbs and sugars because im afraid of developing diabetes 4 checking your pulse all the time to make sure your heart is beating properly unfortunately for me my heart is never beating normally i have constant heart palpitations and my heart races a lot not even sure if its due to anxiety im scared its something serious 5 having very bad mental health days where you cant leave your house this happens to me a lot 6 not knowing if your symptoms are caused by anxiety or something serious this drives me absolutely insane 7 not being able to lead a normal productive for me i cant hold a job because i always fear something bad will happen to me at work and ill panic 8 being triggered by seeing things on shows or in movies for instance a man has a heart attack in the show your watching and then you freak out about having a heart attack 9 obsessively looking up symptoms and not being able to stop once you start 10 wasting a ton of money on doctors appointments only for them to say youre okay 11 being in tons of debt from going to the er because you think youre dying 12 always looking for reassurance from others obsessively asking others if they ever have the same symptoms as you so you dont feel alone these are the only ones i can think of right now but feel free to list the things you deal with as a hypochondriac im curious about what others go through,pre-pandemic

i dont even know how to put all of my thoughts down properly here ive been having terrible emotional breakdowns lately and i have no idea if talking about it will even help all of the problems in my life are directly tied to a condition i was born with and how ive been treated because of it based on what i know when i was born my biological sex was ambiguous and doctors tried to have me surgically corrected into a female my parents have denied knowing anything about it but they refuse to let me have access to my medical records even though im an adult the only reasons i have information about it are because of scars genital pain and hormone internal ultrasound testing from my gyno nothing about my body is sexually correct i have breasts but i have male pattern chest hair and pubic hair i have what should be a vagina but its actually just a small hole so narrow that i cant even use a tampon much less have sex with it i was born with a phallus but they shaved it down until it was the appropriate size to be a clitoris it hurts a lot now even as an adult its like a terrible stinging sensation that gets so bad sometimes that its brought me to tears before i cant even touch the left side of it because it stings and burns so badly ive always known that something was wrong about my body even as a kid i knew that certain things werent right and that i didnt feel the way that other girls did my parents refused to acknowledge it and hid everything from me my parents were very rigid about gender roles when i was growing up and they punished me whenever i didnt behave like my forcibly assigned sex most of my earliest memories are of me crying because i was forced to wear dresses makeup and necklaces i vividly remember begging my mom not to pierce my ears and spending my whole childhood wishing my ears would close up again because wearing earrings made me feel deeply sick when i got older it just got worse my parents wouldnt let me have hobbies or join clubs that they thought werent for my gender they stopped me from doing even simple things like learning to play the trumpet they refused to ever let me cut my hair above shoulder length and would only let me wear clothes that were girl colors if i did anything that deviated from what they wanted they would scream at me and call me a faggot or a dyke even now as an adult living in their house they do this and theyve said physically threatening things like youre not too old for us to spank you when i turned 18 i started having serious medical problems i ended up with an exceedingly rare kidney disorder from a hormone imbalance that came from the surgeries i was forced to have as a baby i nearly died from it that winter but still my parents told me nothing about my medical history i didnt get diagnosed until i was 20 when my pain was getting so horrific that i had to quit school and my job i went for my first visit to a gyno and she told me that i was abnormal i felt like a complete idiot when she told me my parents had always pulled me out of sex ed in school and i was raised in such a strict religious environment that i sincerely had never seen what anatomy was supposed to look like and i felt so broken and stupid then i was so scared of what would happen that i didnt tell my parents anything that my doctor told me i had been dating my boyfriend for years already and i was so scared to tell him that i waited months before i said anything to him either i just feel like such a failure i was never even remotely happy as a woman but i know that my family my boyfriend and everyone else could never accept me as a man either and ive never felt like a man in the first place ive always felt like i was something between that even as far back as i can remember but i know that people could never understand that even someone as loving patient and kind as my boyfriend cant fully understand how deeply this hurts me i feel so completely alone in the world i feel mutilated i feel like a disappointment to my family because i can never be what they wanted physically or emotionally i cant take the pain anymore either im constantly peeing blood and my kidney feels like a knife in my back ive been suffering from depression and dysphoria since early childhood and years of therapy havent helped me i just want it to end no more talk from my parents about how my entire existence is a sin no more feeling like im a horrible mistake and no more feeling like its going to destroy my relationship and hurt the only person who ever truly loved me i wish there were a way to fix this i wish my parents had left my body alone and raised me in a way where i could have been myself but now i feel so lost and alone that i dont even know who or what i am,pre-pandemic

i know everyone here is trying to find answers to cope and overcome their health anxiety and as someone who has fully recovered ive noticed besides many dont really know how recovery looks like if you understand how recovery looks like i believe you wont fall into anxiety cure gimmicks because people dont really talk about how recovery looks like even when you are making progress its easy to selfsabotage and get discouraged during the recovery journey i wanted to give some steps on how recovery looks like i recovered without any meds or supplements btw i focused on acceptance exposure and patience i talk more about recovery below everyone is different and everyone is struggling with different aspects of anxiety derealization physical symptoms panic attacks obsessive what if thinking but much of the core recovery are still the same across the board i found my recovery and those ive helped follow this pattern the recovery journey goes something like this x200b 1 if you struggle with panic attacks this is the first thing to go away much of this is because you lose the fear of panic attacks much of the fear is what keeps panic attacks alive for longer and more frequent once you lose the fear it disappears pretty quick 2 anxiety still remains high so you will still feel feelings of derealization depersonalization physical symptoms what if thoughts but the intensity decreases this is quite stubborn as your nerves are sensitized and your nerves wont calm down so easily there are survival advantages to this as anxiety decreases the what if thinking also decreases physical symptoms lose intensity but are still present 3 you begin feeling glimpses of some freedom from anxiety in this step your fear now shifts from anxiety to what if the anxiety comes back as you start getting better the glimpses of freedom get longer and longer 4 getting hit with setback there will be multiple triggers during recovery that will convince you that you havent made any progress you have keep moving forward as you continue you journey setbacks become less frequent and less intense 5 anxiety eventually disappears but you dont know when it left you because after a while you stop caringyou are too focused on living eventually physical symptoms derealization and everything disappear last at least for me and many of the people i help physical symptoms and derealizationdp lose intensity throughout the progress of recovery so your confidence has grown during the entire duration of recovery ive created a video to really dive deep into the steps of recovery in the link below i also talk about what i did to recover in way more depth in the link below i hope this inspires some hope and minimizes much of the confusion around recovery best of luck to you all,pre-pandemic

just a rant its long malware is software written specifically to harm and infect the host system ptsd is the malware infecting my system and fear is the virus that wrecks havoc so i have been triggered and my symptoms take over my entire being i have 3 options flee freeze or fight these are the only options fear will give me suddenly a harmless and simple situation has turned into a battle for my survival and yes to me its as dire as it sounds so my logic and reason programming has been overridden its not gone its still running but its only running at minimum so the virus can feed off the program and piggy back on the signal to proceed with the virus own programming so i am faced with the three options mentioned above what do they look like flee literally leave the situation in any way i can seeing as the logic and reason programming is still running albeit at a limitation i can process enough information from my environment to look for an immediate exit and follow through with fleeing from the situation analyzing my environment for an exit is about the only way i can use the logic and reason program that is still running and this is an immediate reaction either i phsically leave my environment asap or make arrangements and overcoming necessary hurdles to leave the way i flee is dependant on the trigger that accessed the survival instinct and the severity of my reaction to flee is also dependant on said specific trigger no matter what im doing or whats going on when im triggered its time to flee fight so my fear of my survival has been activated essentially my logic and reason program has been infected with the malicious code fear and my logic and reason programming is running at a minimum ive already scanned and processed the option to leave but i have come to the conclusion that fleeing is not an option meaning my exits in my environment are blocked or there are people who are blocking my exits for my reaction to be extreme enough to want to fight the people blocking my only exits must be some type of authority for example police officers emts or any type of medical professionals my understanding is that these people are the only people who can act on their authority at will with or without good intent in civil society these people are considered as necessary and these people are supposed to hold good intent i am recounting vividly how each and everyone of these so called authority with good intent violated me physically and psychologically seeing as i dont want to relive said horrible experiences again i consider theses authorities as enemies to my survival whenever i see them when my survival instinct has been severely triggered i will fight these authorities i will flail and scream and cry and do whatever makes them feel uncomfortable by being naked or screeching and howling when they touch me and it seems like in my experience these authorities do not have the faculties or understanding to not not treat me like an animal i mean in all of my recounted experiences of cops emts and nurses they exacerbated my symptoms by physically hurting me and demeaning me remember my logic and reason program is still running in the background so im still aware of whats being said to me how they are touching me how they handle me and what emotions they evoke when they demean me plus im cogiscent enough to realize causing injury to said authorities is a metaphorical death sentence i dont want to go to jail or be arrested or treated like a dangerous and malicious mentally ill person so i am cognizant enough not to cause injury to others im just scared and i cry do these professionals really think im a danger to them when im naked and bawling and screeching about being raped and that i dont want to be touched without care dont i have a right to say dont touch me during perineal care yet said medical professionals disregard my repeated requests rendering me even more panicked about being in the er they think im insane well they are the ones who are insane with reasoning that extreme measures of restraint ridicule and deliberate touching of my clitoris is the only way to treat a frightened crying naked young woman who let these people be medical professionals and they get to live their lives thinking they did nothing wrong while i suffer im reliving these memories to the point of not functioning due to the extreme anxiety that these memories induce i have ptsd from my experience at the er ptsd that is being treated with the help of my primary doctor who btw i can barely see because he triggers such horrible feelings and memories medical professionals are suppose to be a beacon of hope but instead they are psychological abusers when it comes to psychological trauma its like all their training goes out the window and im just some animal these medical professionals should not be allowed to wantonly explain away their cruelty and the robbing of my humanity with a phrase of that just my job yet i have no name of the woman who touched my clitoris deliberately while providing perineal care i dont even recall if she was an rn or cna but the restraints those were uncalled for and im going to have to live with that trauma for the rest of my life freeze knowing i cant fight or flee my body and brain just shuts down im immobile incapable of normal interaction im still cognizant of whats around me but im being forced to watch the memories like some sick psycho is tying my down to a chair and forcing horrible movies about my life im shivering holding back tears gripping whatever is in my hand with dear life just visible distressed and immobile every single one of these reactions are embarrassing and shameful in polite society im no longer worthy to exist because people just dont understand what trauma does to a person edit i didnt expect my post would get as much traction as it did thank you for your stories i feel kinda weird for being grateful to share this specific type of trauma with others yet before the ptsd subreddit i felt so alone and so ashamed i wish you all safe travels on the path to healing ps any medical professionals who just have the need to educate me or anyone else on proper ems procedure with the intention to exonerate ems personelwell i cant stop youbut just know your unsolicited advice will fall on deaf ears pss im coming off as angry and maybe a little harsh in my writing tone becauseim angry im not neccesarily proud of sounding so angry but i think i have the right to do so in order to express the trauma i received i believe its part of my personal healing process,pre-pandemic
so lately ive been thinking about the hard limits that having aspergers has placed on my functioning as a social animal my limits are of course different to yours and your limits are different to those of the next person on the spectrum but i think we can safely make a few general statements about the people reading this post youll never be the spontaneous charming hypersocial entertainer in your social circle but youre capable of giving an entertaining speech if you practice and youre not well suited to customerfacing roles but youre capable of performing work which is meaningful to you and valuable to your employer if your needs are accommodated and so on the idea is that were autistic but we also have the capacity to adapt to the world of neurotypicals as autistics we cant reach the highest levels of performance in the social realm but we can socially integrate with neurotypicals with enough skill to get that engineering job or that it role or whatever and let our true strengths shine i wonder though if starting and maintaining a romantic relationship should be considered a high level social task i wonder if most of us with highfunctioning autism just dont have the inherent social ability required for this sort of relationship ive been on speed dates and tried talking to women in public and it just feels like these activities arent meant for people with autism even normal people feel uncomfortable and have difficulty knowing what to say when theyre speaking to a potential date so what has your experience been with autism and the complicated rituals of dating,pre-pandemic

depression and anxiety that i had been keeping down with drugs and alcohol for such a long time surfaced when i finally got sober ive got a long way to go i think but im grateful for every step i have taken along the way ive gotten to know myself and grow like never before ive made so many new friends and reconnected with other ones id cut off when i was using my relationship with my family has never been better although its far from perfect i tend to only focus on the negative aspects of my life so today im trying to see things in another light today ive been sober for 365 days tomorrow there will be 366 hopefully and i probably wont feel any different but im positive i will live a good life and be happy if i stay away from drugs the decision to get sober was the best thing that ever happened to me,pre-pandemic

hi my names sean ive been battling an opioidopiate addiction for 34 years now i think it all started back in 2016 or so i have an illness called ulcerative colitis and if you know anything about the illness youd know it is pure hell the crampspain the embarrassment the isolation its a lonely and painful illness mostly because it prevents you wanting to go out due to constant trips to bathrooms and messy accidents ive shit my pants both at home and in public so many times i lost count you become a homebody and thats not me im a very extroverted guy i love going out having fun shopping partying going to concerts and sports games im very social and i have a lust for life so to speak i remember i started smoking weed when i first got the illness and yeah weed helps but only so much i remember i got a job because i forced myself to it was my first job i was around 18 years old i had a girlfriend and everything so i wanted to impress her my family and friends and show them my disease wouldnt defeat my spirit then i had a bad flare up and when i say bad i mean bad i had to leave work and call out so many times in this two week span and i remember talking to a friend and i told them that nothing really helps for pain except weed but i dont like being high at work i dont work well high he said have you tried percocet i said no of course i havent i had never done anything but weed i didnt even drink at the time he let me borrow a handful of them and told me to let me know if they worked for me and boy did they work i took my first percocet right before a shift i had i was so green i thought this probably wont do anything i was so wrong i felt nothing and everything at the same time no pain no problems no worry i was fucking superman even my coworkers would say wow man youve changed to me in the following weeks i would use the drug i developed this dependence on it because the drug helped make me feel normal which is all i ever wanted and helped me function at home at work at social events i was a different guy i was hooked on them for about two years after that before i quit and honestly the withdrawal period was the worst and lowest point of my life but at least i was clean despite all the pain i was clean i ate better started working out i had friends again but i dont know what happened i got a bad flare and after 7 months of being sober i had to so i took another percocet and when i tell you it was simultaneously the greatest and worst feeling i ever had the greatest because the feeling of euphoria and pain relief couldnt be beaten by a thing id choose this over the strongest orgasm any day of the week and i know that sounds so bad but it is what it is thats what it is like i relapsed in may of 2019 after being sober 7 months and now after a few months of abusing the pills im trying to get clean again im going through withdrawals right now and its the most agonizing pain you could ever go through especially with my ulcerative colitis too it intensifies the pain from that and its so hard for me to keep a smile on my face not snap at anybody and leave my bed i cant be up 10 minutes without falling asleep standing up or missing my bed i sleep but i sleep so brokenly i wake up in intense fits of almost traumatic pain and tbh shit my brains out it feels like theres a knife in my colon scraping against it and then in addition i have these uncontrollable shakes burning fevers cold sometimes freezing sweats im almost 4 days clean now and today im gonna try to have my first full meal since quitting its hell but theres a silver lining and its that i know i can beat this again and anybody else going through it i want you to know that you can too i guess the point of this post is to enlighten and welcome others either going through it or have gone through it or know someone going through it its going to be okay you will beat it choose life like the movie trainspotting said lol hope this helps sorry for how long it is,pre-pandemic

written on the fly my experience with it is that its only a disorder if you try to live the way our culture wants you too the culture that seems only to prize constant economic growth so it gives you things to do with your life that are focused on promoting that growth and those options are miserable for lots of folks and great for typeas and others like sociopaths but for those of us who identify as adhd its constantly aggravating you see so much similarity with the shambles our lives become as we constantly try to keep up with all the things you have to do to keep the growth going ive seen so many stories of shame selfloathing and sadness because you just cannot seem to get life done it is a battle every 15 minutes every day to check your focus to not upset your spouse because a chore was forgotten or be viewed as unreliable by peers because you have issues with being ontime or you spaced out on a task you can become fearful of what others think and hide out and wish you were differentthat is what a culture focused primarily on economic growth gets you it cares about performance over selfworth having an issue regulating your attention is a disorder in such a society because you are viewed as labor and a resource and are expected to function as such its all inputs and outputs and metrics very rightbrained very industrial and so only from that perspective is it a disorder i have found island cultures tend to mesh well with attention issues it is a slower paced what is needed to live well is much less there tends to be an actual emphasis on family as opposed to lip service we give here like shaming people who move back home all those things make life easier because there is not as much competing for your attention and that which does positively reinforces a way of being that lets you flourish as you were made which benefits us all in ways that often cant be quantified versus a way of being that treats you as a cog does not share in the growth you generated and prefers you drug it up to cope with the misery of making other people money from an air conditioned cage and the drugs are not just ritalin they are also found in our food and they affect your attention significantly im not anti gmo or anything i try to stick for fish for meat but who doesnt love bbq im just talking about eating cleanly mostly organic plant matter and how if you suffer from attention issues and you radically change your diet you will see how it helps your attention you are literally taking yourself off drugs by doing this i dont believe any of this is a conspiracy we got here piece by piece as a culture that is like thisbut consider that your rapid attention gives you awareness and you are perfectly aware living how they suggest is not working so now be aware that you dont have to do it their way and love yourself it is so hard after years of beating myself up take none of this that i am living super well with my adhd i still get so sad sometimes but i get present with it i am aware it is a result of years of learned behavior and i sit in that awareness and i breathe,pre-pandemic

the reason i subscribed to this sub in the first place was that i like most of you felt lonely and depressed all of the time i had no energy or drive to get up and do anything i wanted some comradeship and justification for these feelings today i have made friends i have gone to dates im an active member in a social circle and people seek out my company so i just wanted to say thank you and good luck i hope i never end up here again and i hope you all can eventually leave as well see you on the other side,pre-pandemic
i dont know if this is normal doubt it when it gets to this point or a bpd thing but ive been this way for as long as i can remember whether its something about fantasy elves magic vampires etc drugsaddiction a documentary high school comedydrama etc etc etc i feel like im consumed by it and thats me example right now ive started watching euphoria and instantly i felt myself dissociate go into a darker mode think like a character become sluggish wish i had drugs want to become a bigger mess and die so this show is putting bad and risky feelings into me some showsmovies make me bubbly and pleasant and act like someone else its not me being easily influenced because trust me im really not in general but this always happens with things i watch am i just off or does anyone else know this feeling,pre-pandemic

so recently ive been trying to work things out with my ex and hes been pretty nasty to me at times and at one point he called me a sociopath because i still wanted to talk to him even though he told me i was disgusting and a whore and this and that and after having abusive exes and an abusive mom and shit like that my ptsd allows me to completely disassociate when people abuse me i disassociate and compartmentalize without even realizing it and its like i do this shit with my mom because i love her and i do it with him because i love him and i just have this understanding that if i love them and want them in my life i have to take the abuse for a little while but wow it was an interesting realization,pre-pandemic
our friends and family all assume my young sis has autism or some sort of disorder like asperger however im the only one in my family that thinks she is just an evil and cunning person that has ruined the entire family she is 30 ive read up on autism and she does exhibit only some of the symptons for example communications she is bilingual and can speak faster than i can her vocabs arent brilliant but it does get the job done saying that she doesnt have any friends incredibly manipulative ive even google to see if autistic people even knows how to blackmail people came up with no results and most of the time it says they have difficulty understanding jokes or sarcasm however my young sis understands them fully well we have had maids or caretakers in the past she blackmails them to buy her toys and things she wants or she threatens to get them fired by lying to our parents for beating her etc every time we take her to see an autism specialistdr she puts on an act she refuses to answer any question and if she does its always a one word answer like yes maybe and no most of the time she will say maybe just to confuse them she is very attached to my mother and not a minute of the day that she would leave her side she is also very abusive and violent if you confront her and tell her off or say things she doesnt like she will slap kick spit on you im the only one that she wont do it to because i will return simply return the favour she slapped my grandad who was 90 years old in a wheelchair simply because he told her stop being so naughty or when he takes up my moms time gets jealous of any one getting close to my mom including my dad needless to say they havent slept in the same room for the past 30 years now from what i believe she started off being just slightly weird but over the years its getting worse and worse i think she puts on an act at first but because she keeps repeating this all day she has grown into it and its becoming a normal thing for her she pretends so much that its becoming a reality and she is going crazy saying that she did get put into a mental hospital last year for beating up nurses and doctors my parents had to pull some strings and make up lies to get her out of it i can go on and on and on but from what i wrote it doesnt sound like she has autism right she does exhibits mental illness things like she will stare at space and will start laughing and try to talk to invisible objectsnot person she makes weird sounds daily like a baby she acts like a baby all the time makes really weird and strange faces from what i can see it is a way to get my moms attention and she thinks its cute to act that way up to around age 25 i think she she was just a cunning and evil person but the last 5 years has changed so much that i dont think she is putting up an act anymore she is going lunatic she tells blatant lies all the time example she gets into argument with me and while my mom is looking she will pretend shes fallen over and claim that i beat her and call the police or when she take things and will say that she hasnt taken it even though you caught her in the act gets away with it all the time because everyone is scared to confront her no one wants to deal with the drama i should just do the right thing and send her off to the mental institute but my mom cant handle it she is too attached to her and doesnt want to give up on her daughter every time i mention that the family would be together again if we just send her away but she refuses she says the hospital doesnt even let her visit plus every time they drug her up so much that she doesnt even recognise us however imo i think sacrificing one person in the family is better than destroying the whole family but the damage is already done and i think its already too late,pre-pandemic

before i came across this subs i didnt even know what gaslighting was it was something so ingrained in our family dynamic that i didnt realise how toxic it was my nmom is the worst for it i never had a name for it but i just knew there was no point in ever challenging her about anything because her story always changes well this weekend i was the one to do it im ashamed to admit that this is not my first time but im actively working to change my partner very kindly did lots of house work as this is a contentious issue for us at times when i saw he had done so much i didnt know if saying thank you and making a big deal would cause tension so i left it with the aim to say thank you later as i was making lunch he made a light hearted comment about how i didnt thank him for doing the housework instead of apologising and saying it in the moment i replied i did cant you remember as soon as the words left my mouth my heart sunk yuck what was i doing so i quickly caught myself and said oh shit i didnt actually say it did i i just thought it doesnt really count when you do that sorry haha and then proceeded to tell him how thankful i was i hate that this is an automatic response for me to lie like this but hopefully if i keep challenging myself i can eradicate it from my reflexes,pre-pandemic
you recently found your phone from 20142015 you were just 19 then wow you look so young you were going through some hard shit man i know you wanted to kill yourself every day and i know there were good reasons but turning to drugs was not the correct answer and you never did feel better in fact you felt 10 times worse scared and trapped like an animal in case you forget here is a short list of the drugs youve done nicotine alcohol marijuana cocaine methamphetamine synthetic spice acid lsd xanax heroin based mdma and psychedelic mushrooms oh i guess thats not a short list huh you were actually a fuck up how did that happen and why didnt you stop you werent happy with your childhood so you became a troublemaker and your friends were troublemakers too so im not surprised they started doing drugs and you did them as well they say that weed isnt a gateway drug but after smoking it for a couple of years you wanted to move on and do more maybe that isnt the case for everyone but for you an addictive personality one taste and one drug isnt enough at any point you could have stopped using drugs but you didnt its not because you didnt want to no its because you were addicted and dont let any version of us tell you different let me take you down memory lane to highlight your drug use okay so this story is a little funny but it shows you how dumb weed is and no you cannot complete engineering college while smoking you were in physics class high because it was right after lunch mr payne handed out some quizzes and it looked like algebra but there were no numbers just variables nobody seemed to understand how to complete the quiz but you had an epiphany all the letters suddenly made sense and the equations were so easy the equations were solvable without numbers you even told andres to cheat off of your quiz because you were so confident after turning in the quiz mr payne graded them and gave them back you made a 17 or something like that you actually thought you were going to get a high grade but it turned out you werent supposed to solve anything just rearrange the variables into formulas and you failed the shit out of that quiz and so did andres im going to keep the memories coming for you you wanted to buy cocaine but your dealer was out of town so you asked nic where to get some he messaged a few people and said he found where he and you could buy so you and nic got the cocaine with the last of the money in your bank account and brought it back to that shitty no furniture apartment of yours it was very compacted and pressed together so you had to really cut it up eventually it was fine enough to snort this coke stung your nostrils and it was very strong stronger than any coke youd ever done nic laughed and said to you that this wasnt coke it was meth he told you he could tell because he was a recovering meth addict so in that drug addict brain of yours you decided to smoke the meth using a lighter aluminum foil and a dollar bill instead of throwing it out you fucking smoked the rest of the meth this memory is so hazy i dont even know if the details are accurate you lived at dennys and had a major panic attack you had been smoking cigarettes weed and drinking all day your chest started to get super tight and you felt like you were dying to this day i dont even remember if this really happened but i think you called dad you told him you thought you were having a heart attack and asked what to do somehow you didnt end up going to the hospital but you really thought you were going to die how would dad have felt if he knew you were fucked up and wasted on drugs how would he have felt if you did die and the autopsy revealed that you odd on something remember syphoning gas from peoples cars wow you really did it all didnt you you worked a fulltime job in construction and somehow managed to live like a fucking homeless person thats almost impressive how stupid it is im going to tell you your story about syphoning gas because its so retarded and dont forget you were high the entire time you drove your car down an alley at around 200am and parked it about 300 feet from where you were going to syphon you left the door cracked and the keys loosely in the ignition so you could get out fast if you had to so on you go carrying your gas jug and tubing until you get to some older vehicles because you cant syphon new vehicles you stick your tube down into the gas tank and get some suction and it starts flowing get your fill and its on to the next one youre now at like your 3rd car and you hear some rocks scatter so you take your shit and bolt down the alley but instead of leaving you keep syphoning just further away eventually you hear another sound and bolt to your car but the fucking door got closed by the wind wow you locked yourself out of your car and youre carrying a gas can tubes and your breath smells like gas that was a great idea leaving the keys in the car to have a head start you hear police sirens and throw the gas can over a fence into one yard the hosing in another and pull up planet fitness on your phone the police blocked the alley and came up to you asking what you were doing you told them you were lost and trying to go to the gym but he smelled your breath then checked your pockets and there was more tubing in your pockets that you forgot about you got put in the back of a cop car and two people were talking to the police outside you couldnt help but start crying because your entire life was a fuck up so far over the course of what seemed like an eternity but was probably an hour the police officer in the front seat was asking you questions like why are you doing this where are your parents etc he got your full sob story which was true but a sob story anyways remember those rocks you heard shuffle in the beginning those were two separate people who caught your ass and they called the police but lucky for you the cop youd been talking to talked them into letting it all slide you somehow didnt get into any trouble i think you used all your lifes luck in this moment one of the men agreed not to press charges if he could speak with you he said i heard some shit in my yard and saw a man messing with my car so i got my gun and was going to shoot but then you ran down the street then the cop told you a quote that i still appreciate to this day he said son there are two types of criminals those in prison and those who are not in prison yet and you are not a very good criminal so i suggest you drop all of this and leave it behind you with that he let you out of the car and helped you unlock your car door at least you learned from this and never stole again writing this is a surreal experience ive been sober for 35 years and looking at those old pictures of you i dont even know you i say good riddance you were a belligerent thieving sob story telling deceiving irresponsible piece of shit you did nothing to prepare me for the future writing this in 2nd person isnt even weird because thats how unalike we are i get my bills paid on time i have a good credit score i am going to college and making good grades i work full time i have morals i stick to i invest in my future i am not perfect but im 10x better than you ever were,pre-pandemic
my anxiety began about 6 years ago from smoking a really potent strand of marijuana i had my first panic attack while i was extremely high and thought i was going to die ever since that moment i had a chain reaction of daily panic attacks for about 6 months it was awful i made my husband take me to the er so many times convinced i was dying x200b i didnt understand why my body was doing this and it created an extreme hypochondriac version of myself i couldnt get off of google i had convinced myself i had ms als parkinsons brain tumors cancer blood disorders liver conditions you name it the thing about health anxiety is that when you read about symptoms and convince yourself you have symptoms your brain plays a tricky game on you where it begins to create those symptoms our brains are a very powerful thing we still dont fully understand them but i assure you our brains very much have the power to create symptoms from merely being scared of getting them we have lizard brains in all of our years of evolution our brains still have the ol fight or flight system we are creatures of incredibly complex thoughts our brains have one focused end goal it is always trying to achieve survival because of this our brains love to worry so we can create ways to survive although useful this has turned into an extremely harmful thing when misused by hypochondriacs we are constantly worrying constantly trying to find ways to overcome hidden diseases that arent even there trust me i have been there and was there for several years but i have not had a panic attack in three years and when i do get bouts of anxiety i can overcome it within 13 minutes aside from the usual suggestions on here which i fully endorse x200b 1 exercisewalking 2 practice mindfulnessmeditation 3 supplement with magnesium or adaptogens like ashwagandha 4 get off google look google can be helpful i still find myself using it to research symptoms but i made myself a rule only google a symptom if i have been enduring it for longer than 12 weeks if i am still having issues evaluate everything going on in my life is something i am doing causing this symptom stress an injury am i not drinking enough water not getting enough sleep what has my diet been like if the symptom is effecting me severely for more than a week or two which it hardly ever does because i will not google it then maybe i can see if its something worth looking into so i can find other options to help myself 5 gratitude journal seriously the more i focus on the good things i have going on in my life and the more i practice telling people thank you smelling the air getting out in the sunshine the less power anxiety has over me 6 nature being in nature is so powerful i remember when i used to have anxiety attacks if i went outside and walked around my panic attack would melt away pretty quickly there are all kinds of studies on the effects that nature has on us obviously this is hard during winter but things i have found to combat that are filling my home with lots of plants and absorbing myself and being a good plant parent going to the conservatory 7 hugs seriously another thing that i find extremely relaxing is hugging there is also quite a lot of research on this as well 8 bellydiaphragm breathing 9 diet i know this is always brought up but man is it true a lot of the foods we consume fuck with our blood sugar and impair our bodys ability to cope with stress the best thing i did for my health anxiety was purchasing the book dare the new way to end anxiety and stop panic attacks i do not have enough good things to say about this book it changed my life a huge component of this book is that how we react and by reacting to panic attacks is what keeps triggering them our fear of fear is what keeps triggering the constant fear it has a simple solution but takes time and patience and can be very uncomfortable it wont end getting feelings of anxiety but it gives you the tools to let those feelings be small and fleeting so you can easily move on the book also comes with a link to his app which has a lot of great audio content to get you through a panic attack when you are having one which i used to use on the airplane x200b when we feel anxiety coming on and we think oh shit not now fuck how do i get through this i need to calm down its ok its ok we are validating the anxiety and confirming to ourselves that these feelings of anxiousness are something to be scared of and something that we need to immediately be relieved of we are training our brains to react to anxiety instead of simply letting it be there and then move on from it my saving grace is picturing my anxiety as an adolescent version of myself when anxiety pops up in my body i immediately envision myself holding the hand of the child version of myself and thinking oh hey wow it is so nice to have you back i am just going to the grocery store or whatever activity you are doing at the moment want to come along lets go together it will be so fun sometimes i envision my childlike version of myself as anxiety reincarnated and then i take sympathy for this anxiety kidversion of myself and envision myself nurturing them throughout the panicanxiety i will think to myself is this all you got because i actually forgot how much i love feeling dizzy and how much i love trembling it actually makes me feel alive bring it on i can take more when you feel anxiety coming on you have to start training your brain to welcome it this is uncomfortable at first who wants to be facing an oncoming panic attack and think woohoo youre finally here but i swear to you it works it takes patience consistency and follow through but this method seriously saved my life when we start associating anxiety as a passing thought something that is normal and boring your brain will stop associating the feeling of anxiety as something to freak the fuck out over even the first time i tried this i was surprised with how fast the attackanxiety passed the more you begin to destruct how you react to anxiety the quicker the anxiety attack will pass each time you have an episode anxiety is created by our brainsnervous system and therefore we need to begin retraining our brains when you start to panic over symptoms think to yourself i have an extremely powerful capable body and i am much stronger than i give myself credit for i have overcome this anxiety before and it will pass again my body is tricking me i am just going to continue doing xxx activity and if these symptoms want to come along then that is fine they can be there we can coexist because i know it is just going to pass but i am going to bring my attention to this thing i am doing now i promise you you can beat health anxiety by having the tools to not let it consume you we will always be more sensitive to symptoms but we can absolutely have the tools to not freak out over it and ruin our days let me know if you have any questions i recently saw i was still subscribed to this sub and wanted to let everyone know that there is hope,pre-pandemic
ive dealt with substance abuse and addiction for a long time in my life ive personally used more drugs than most have probably even heard of and ive been hooked to my fair share of them throughout my many soires with dependency ive learned a good deal about how addiction works and because of that whenever i see others discuss it it makes me so sad and sometimes even angry at their ignorance when people discuss addicts most of the time they do so with a tone of disgust and animosity ugh these people make me sick we shouldnt even narcan them do the world a favor addiction is a choice you got yourself here its your fault i can understand their resentment perhaps they have personally been hurt by an addict maybe it was their family or friend maybe they have been stolen from lied to or betrayed after this it can be hard to find pity for them because from the outside it is so easy to say why are you choosing to do something that hurts you and everyone around you why do you keep doing it but thats not how it works when you are gripped by addiction you dont get to make a choice the choice has been made for you the only choice you get is the choice to live or die and our inherent desire for self preservation is a powerful driver the heroin addict isnt choosing to be a heroin addict theyve fallen into the same trap that so many others have fallen into before them the trap of escapism the healthy happy person doesnt choose to shoot up there has to be some deep discontent that drives them to any avenue of relief if you live your whole life being miserable and one day you discover a cure for that misery its not quite as simple as just dont do it it can seem like the only option the only escape from the incessantly servile rat race of every day life imagine being given the cure for your constant debilitating pain and being told you cant have it and you just need stronger will power i see this attitude with other non substance addictions as well particularly with food addiction theres this disgusting attitude i notice on reddit where people shame the obese under a bullshit guise of benevolence because shame makes people change no shame doesnt make people want to change it makes them hate themselves even more it makes them apathetic miserable and desperate for any sense of comfort that shame is what drives them to overindulge in the first place and the lack of empathy and arrogance of these people who insult and degrade other human beings disgusts me i hate the lack of empathy i hate the ignorance i hate that we cannot just for once reach a hand out to the people who need it i hate that we cant just for once say im here for you youre loved and you can get better these people are whats wrong with the world not the addicts the addicts are sick the others are hateful fools something i wrote a long time ago on a dark and lonely night the darkest sky birth to the brightest day the forgotten hours in which he waste away the lonely man looks to a new days sky he was void and cold but could never cry the sunrise now no beacon of hope a symbol of deviancy with unknown scope his eyes burned and his head fought back worries and fears the minds payback dawn had come and so he went to uphold his ungodly covenant with his rites the battles ceased quelled his demon fed the beast the darkest sky the most forgotten hours the only time free from the souls devour his spirit cursed forever corrupted and unclean his reflection blighted such is the fate of the fiend,pre-pandemic

i took my comment from another thread to start this discussion my mom had bpd and abandoned me when i was 3 thankfully my dad was amazing and held onto me whenever i would see her starting again at age 6 her symptoms would have her be extremely volatile she wouldnt give me affection unless it was a show for someone else called me her niece in public for a while drank all the time and made her adult problems mine i had to escort her out of family parties at 10 when she would get drunk and belligerent when i was 13 or so i remember she spit on me when i was 16 she chased me into a bathroom and told be she was going to beat my ass because i started calling my step mom mom too i never called her by her name to her face she just didnt want to share following 16 she started with a lot of false suicide attempts for attention which i always treated seriously our relationship was so weird first she didnt want me then we were familiar strangers acquaintances distant cousins and then friends until her last suicide attempt that accidentally went through the table broke under her the police i called called me to come down it was the day before her dads 70th birthday and i had to tell him to his face that his daughter was never coming back i did her makeup for her viewing its the least i could do i loved her so much in the most damaging way to myself i put up with everything because it was obvious her bpd made her suffer and everyone except her family left her i couldnt stop grasping for the love she wasnt able to give now i struggle to get and keep jobs that was only the worst thing that happened to me i had a marriage with a man that was practically the male version of her and i was raped after i left himi got catfishedplease dont call me stupid i was vulnerable it took 9 months to meet now the obvious triggers get to me cluttered houses crowds loud places and the month of july is awful for me sorry this was so long tldr mom had bpd was abusive killed herself and involved me now the obvious triggers get to me cluttered houses crowds loud places and the month of july is awful for me edit i havent cried about this in months and now im sitting on my hallway floor leaking through my eyes and thinking about learning how to paint so i can get my nightmares out,pre-pandemic
the socalled psychotically depressed person who tries to kill herself doesnt do so out of quote hopelessness or any abstract conviction that lifes assets and debits do not square and surely not because death seems suddenly appealing the person in whom its invisible agony reaches a certain unendurable level will kill herself the same way a trapped person will eventually jump from the window of a burning highrise make no mistake about people who leap from burning windows their terror of falling from a great height is still just as great as it would be for you or me standing speculatively at the same window just checking out the view ie the fear of falling remains a constant the variable here is the other terror the fires flames when the flames get close enough falling to death becomes the slightly less terrible of two terrors its not desiring the fall its terror of the flames and yet nobody down on the sidewalk looking up and yelling dont and hang on can understand the jump not really youd have to have personally been trapped and felt flames to really understand a terror way beyond falling this quote is from infinite jest by david foster wallace im honestly starting to feel the flames and the jump is looking far too comforting,pre-pandemic
honestly this is one of the most puzzling things about society people tell you that we dont live in a vaccum everyone has people who care along with other shamings of suicide calling you cowardly but when you want to liveoh no youre entitled to nothing if you dont do well in school your parents kick you out and you end up homeless liviing on a cardboard box but remember dont kill yourself because people care about you so much i understand having to work to participate in society but i find it so stupid that people cant see the incongruity i cant honestly imagine telling a homeless person freezing in the cold keep struggling because life is worth it if they want to die then let them die and vice versa,pre-pandemic
you know it you meet someone boom 24 hours later youve mapped out your future for me this is always in a romantic sense this person likes me ive got my hopes up bpd me is like date them make it exclusive tie them down so they cant leave you you know what i did i told this person when it came up in the conversation that im not in the place to date seriously that im happy to see where things go and just hang out and have fun i didnt pressure them to date me or try and work out if they wanted to date me i left it light and breezy obviously the bpd part of my brain is screaming but i actually managed to do it i actually managed to convince myself that this person is not my soulmate ive known them a week and that trying to lock them down in a relationship is neither healthy nor wise for either of us this may seem tiny but for me this is a massive achievement,pre-pandemic

so at the beginning of this week i was diagnosed with and started treatment for fairly severe adult adhd 10mg of dexedrine a day ramping up to 20mg next week then levelling off this was basically confirming something i was diagnosed with as a child and had known about for a long time but hadnt dealt with in any meaningful way i am in my final year of university in london studying for a ba in english lit yes what can you do with a ba in english is my theme song and spent my second year on exchange to uc santa cruz in california i didnt do very well in my first year at uni got depressed and behind had trouble completing work on time concentrating etc i was getting 1sts and high 21s the equivalent to an american universitys a or a on all work i actually handed in its just that i wasnt handing in very much work i had previously done very well at school prior to higher education in spite of concentration problems other learning difficulties bullying and the like so not doing well academically was a huge blow i ended up having to do everything that was overdue all at once at the last minute a situation thats repeated this year to a certain extent although now that im in treatment and working again it seems we caught it in time the reason i mentioned ucsc was because while i was there i had access to both some of the best weed in the world at good prices from reliable dealers and dispensaries and my flatmates supply of adderal for when i needed to write a paper id been smoking for three or four years by this point and generally found it took the edge off my world experience made me feel calmer and weirdly less paranoid i did extremely well academically got straight as without trying particularly hard was happy and generally flourished in that environment i was planning to apply to a phd program when i got back to the uk fast forward a year and id been intellectually paralysed more or less since getting back from california had done barely any work for several months was depressed and nearsuicidal over my workload and the possibility of failing my degree at the final hurdle it looked like my life was going to take a dramatic turn for the worse my partner effectively forced me to confront the issue rather than just hiding from it and ive now got both a diagnosis and the medication to treat my condition honestly its like having my mind back after a year i can concentrate im not paranoid and on edge the entire time im calm focused and able to work for the first time in months im no longer failing my degree and have done more work in the last three days than i had in the rest of the academic year turns out id been effectively treating the social side of the adhd constantly being onedge paranoia some hyperactivity talking too much butting in and finishing other peoples sentences etc with weed for the year i was in california and earlier as well and had obviously used my flatmates adhd medication for its intended purpose as and when i needed when i got back to the uk and didnt have regular access or none at all for the adderal to either of those things which kept me level and working i fell apart now that im on medication im doing so much better its almost unbelievable i wanted to share my story and i had a question for you guys as well what are your opinions on the use of marijuana for adhoc or where legal prescribed treatment of some of the symptoms of adhdadd is it even able to be prescribed for the condition in us states where there are medical marijuana laws im curious because it seemed to genuinely help me in social terms and id rather not be permanently on large doses of dexedrine or other fairly powerful amphetamines constantly although obviously will be taking them regularly enough to keep my dopamine levels up for the rest of my life tldr i used weed to treat social symptoms of my nowdiagnosed adult adhd and my flatmates adderal last year for academic work fell apart academically this year at uni due to not having either of those and a lack of actual treatment but now have meds and am doing well what are your opinions on its use as treatment for the social symptoms in situations where concentration is not required for work as well as an occasional replacement for the calming effects of amphetaminebased treatment when fluctuating dosage downwards ps for the benefit of the mods can i say that im not advocating marijuana as a replacement for actually treating adhdadd and obviously know its illegal in most of the world including where i live but i wanted to share my experience and do have a genuine question about peoples experiences with and opinions on its use as a complement to medication and whether it can be prescribed in us states which have medical marijuana laws peace out,pre-pandemic

hi all x200b ill try to write this in a few words im trying to find evidence of a link between that genes that give us autistic traits and physical strength as it happens to me ill explain below and have a video below for you to see its not a joke its a serious questionstudy i have x200b i think autism could be a wonderful thing although i realize its not always the case but i found i was aspergerautism level 1 some weeks ago and everything in my life made more sense than before x200b i tried to find out if i was when i found some hidden papers from my childhood telling that between 2 and 6 years old i was a more severe case of autism child not talking to anyone agressive isolating myself etc between 6 and 8 i improved a lot since then i had a wonderful life and nowadays im just a mild autistic person and never imagined i was x200b as i now know how to talk to people recognize sarcasm and use it almost eliminated my obsessive compulsive disorder got used to look peoples in the eyes doesnt mean i like it can make friends talk to strangers etc x200b im just very distracted which now i know its the reason that my relationships all went bad once i turned around and noticed that my girlfriend was 40 feet back staring at me saying you werent listening to me you dont love me etc so my distraction destroys relationships and i dont feel the need to be with people but besides that my life seems perfect this way i have 911 autistic traits from the known panflets about autism but always lived a neurotypical life x200b i even got to have perfect motor skills etc x200b now i learned that some of my physical traits came from autism like my hypersensitivity to light my hypersensitivity to sounds even listen to my neighbours discussions pain tolerance probably my cold tolerance can stand below 0c 30 farenheit just in a tshirt not feeling cold x200b and i know i have a really unusual strength i can roll 3 or 4 frying pans together as if they were mazagines i can bend horseshoes with my hands bend steel bars adjustable wrenches but having a height of 511 and a bodyweight of 140lbs body mass index 19 to 20 never had training before x200b of course then i started doing feats and improved but my base strength was too high x200b check an example x200b i know i look pretty neurotypical but i guess nobody will say that to me here as ive heard also from my friends that you dont look autistic i have grown to be almost neurotypical besides my adhd walking on the street with mathematical patterns like fibonacci loving to be alone etc on the video i may look some neurotypical guy if thats what you might think but i still have 911 from the 14 basic autistic traits x200b they say my brain compensated at my time there wasnt a 2e child i would be autistic or not autistic just that my mother insisted for me to go to a public school no special teaching and i adapted luckily because of my brain for what they say i learn everything very quickly am a selftaught polymath x200b i cant go higher on my trainings because when bending unbraced using only hands or wrists steel bars that require above 600lbs of force to bend i start having blood coming out from the pores of my skin and hear my heartbeat intracranial blood pressure too high and risk of brain hemorrage etc so i stopped training because i found my bodys limits but not my strength limit though x200b i think this may come from autism x200b i even made a video telling that to find others but its in a terrible english x200b i think it would be too much of a coincidence for me to have adapted to society very well in my point of view because people say im a little antisocial as im very introvert but not shy and besides all the cool traits i had having also this huge physical strength x200b so i thought it must have come from the aspergers also x200b and once someone told me like it seems you want to be like da vinci as i specialized in several areas like computer programming technical analysis on finantial markets etc but also painted created and play music etc and i answered no i would never be like him ive very strong and he wasnt x200b after all i was mistaken da vinci was very very strong and was able to bend horseshoes with his hands like me and he was asperger like me x200b so there must be a link here x200b im not saying all aspergers or autistic persons are very strong maybe its a rare gift but i believe there is a relation x200b i thought in creating that video so that i would reach very strong and light some steel benders and oldtimestrongmen hoping some of them would be aspergers x200b i thought that if there were like 1 aspergers in population or autistic persons like me and i would find 10 or 20 or 30 of aspergers in the middle of the strongest guys ive found there would be a link x200b but they usually dont like the idea to do asperger tests some due to religion issues someone explained that it would lead to discussions others because they dont see themselves as autistic like i never did because i was ignorant in that area so i didnt have much luck convincing them to do the tests x200b so my only option left was to ask autistic persons like me if they knew cases of that and here i am x200b there is a point in this oldtime strongmen in the past always said this dennis rogers says x200b that each one has a governor our heads that limits us like a chip in a car that if we take the chip out it would be a lot faster but blow up its engine sooner a measure to protect us x200b some say some persons have more tolerant governors letting them use more strenght when their lives are at risk they call it hysterical strength but its a rare phenomenon difficult to study x200b you can see one explanation for this x200b you can see in the middle they notice he has a lot more muscle acceleration than usual he has a lot more muscle fibers being activated at once than the typical human being i have no clue if hes aspie or not though x200b and this comes from our brains more muscle fibers activated at once by each motorneurons we have or having more motorneurons or activating more than usual etc etc x200b so it comes from our minds as human beings are a lot stronger than we imagine we are just limited to a certain ammount of strength for our own sake and some persons can go beyond that having no limits x200b as i have that rolling frying pans with my hands the first time ive tried and adjustable wrenches with no train for 10 years before and 140lbs for 511 tall i have that surely x200b now i was a more severe case of autism in childhood nowadays everybody think im a typical neurotypical person but im asperger still x200b there must be a link im certain of that and i notice certain oldtimestrongmen in the past like mighty atom in the us seemed asperger to me introverts focused on certain hobbies etc x200b on the asperger section nobody had clear answers maybe here some of you have x200b do you know examples of stronger than usual persons being autistic specially level 1 autismasperger to be sure it happens also in aspergers like me thats its a trait possible in mild autism also x200b if so tell me your opinion on this or where should i find examples i want to test my theory and find answers and know what gave me this strength autism or i was simply gifted with strength also x200b by the way this is a serious question im really interested to find out im not claiming to be super man or something x200b or it would be very important if you know do you know some specialist that may study these things and give me answers someone that studies autistic traits etc x200b thanks,pre-pandemic

so i got this friend we met a couple of years ago and i also got to know her husband and her two sons the older one was about 5 and his little brother was 2 years old i think they were really lovely the older one a shy and thoughtful kid while the younger one was more playful and wild over the time we lost contact and stayed in touch via facebook so a year back i read a status of her where she claimed that her two sons and herself as well were diagnosed with aspergers autism i write it like that because i dont know if they went to see a doctor and if this diagnose is of any professional nature as she was not one to trust doctors so the last few months she was posting more than usual on facebook and some of the things she wrote left me speechless so her older son is in his last year of grade school and she made a post where she complained about his teacher apparently her son had only done a lot of his homework in a sloppy fashion not finishing most of his assigments so she went to the teacher who did not recognize the autism of her son she had said telling her that he could not do that because he was autistic she then asked people on facebook if they could help with his homework because it was midnight and they were still trying to finish it all i went through more of her posts today there was one were she said she was desperate because her sons didnt want to go to sleep which is pretty normal for children i think and when someone commented a thing like those naughty boys she went wild on them saying it was only because they are autistic and there comes the part that makes me angry she uses the autism of her boys as an excuse for everything sheltering them behind this badge i dont want to sound insensitive now but does it help a child to tell them at every occasion that they are not able to do certain things because of a diagnose this can really twist your life i knew a boy in my teens he got diagnosed with borderline and as he read about the often occuring self harming issue he started to cut his wrists just to fit into that diagnose because sloppy diagnoses often can do more harm than the problem itself i did research and i am by far no expert on this topic but i read that aspergers has not much to do with not finishing things or not listening to your parents the boy might have just been lazy with his homework which is normal for a child but as a parent i can not tell this kid that its okay because his autism is to blame how do you see this i think it does much harm to a child when he is always told that they are different and that they shouldnt set their standarts high because theyll never do better autism cant be abused as an excuse for every problem that occurs with a child its normal that kids misbehave and act shy or lazy but i cant blame autism for everything i mean even if they are autistic in first place they are children who deserve acceptance and encouragement what do you think about it sorry for the long post and my bad english sorry if anything sounds offending i really dont want to offeny anyone im just curious about the topic,pre-pandemic
someone will piss me off ill be like ill just skip dinner thatll really stick it to them but does it really,pre-pandemic

99 of the posts on this sub are of people panicking and in need of immediate reassurance that theyre okay i suppose thats the nature of health anxiety but it makes for a stressful online environment without any real growth i would love to see this sub dedicated more towards recovering from ha and supporting real progress rather than just applying bandaids after all seeking and receiving reassurance is actually harmful and makes ha worse in the long run we need more success stories no matter how small methods for distracting from ha temporary solutions methods for confronting ha longterm solutions sharing advice from therapists personal reviews of antianxiety medications posts updated with outcomes posts about developing and maintaining good physical health community challenges weekly success threads so many of us engage in unhealthy behaviors that will inevitably lead to the disease we so dread so many of us worry about nonpreventable disease that we forget to do what we can to prevent preventable disease so many of us have a selfdefeating mentality that we will always struggle with ha and that theres nothing to be done about it but suffer through it but there are steps to take healthy habits to practice and real solutions to address the root of our anxiety and this subreddit should be a hub for that kind of supportive information a beacon of hope for people who cant stop worrying about their health and need practical tangible help lets not wallow lets do the work together can we hold each other accountable for unsafeunhealthy behaviors check up on each other be more intentional with our posts can we cultivate a culture of real healing rather than just putting out endless fires edited to add more bullet points,pre-pandemic

a fellow redditor posted a question about how to deal with fixating on symptoms and i decided to share my way perhaps it can be helpful to someone for me once i fixate on a symptom no form of distraction works reading playing games tv nothing the more i try to distract myself from it the more i notice it so i do these steps 1 accept that im experiencing a symptom yes i have a headache yes my heart palpitates and remind myself its just that a symptom and not a full blown deadly condition like my anxiety makes it to be 2 think of three different reasons why i may be experiencing this symptom that is not about dying aka i have a headache because ive stared at a screen for a few hours my heart is palpitating because i ate too much sugarim dehydrated etc 3 try to focus on a reason behind the symptom thats not about dying then try to do something about it if possible if i tell myself my palpitations are from lack of water i refill my water bottle if i tell myself im dizzy because of the lack of fresh air i go outside for a bit etc etc 4 in some cases when i am fixated to hell and back i confess itt to someone like hey im feeling uneasy today and im fixated on these palpitations i might speak stupid stuff for a bit im lucky i have close people who get me by now if youre all alone message us in this subreddit 5 i then spend a few hours going what if its actually a heart attack tho to my friend to which they say no its alright youre perfectly healthy its like fixating on yoir tongue in your mouth and suddenly it feels weird and restless and like something is wrong i say all the crazy shit that this symptom makes me think all of them even the silly ones like what of palpitations are actually my heart preparing to stop most of the time seeing someone else completely unbothered by my panicked thoughts make me relax because my friend would be actually worried if something was wrong them being calm shows me how crazy my anxiety makes it all to look like once ive said it all out loud its easier to stop rethinking the same things 6 next time i fixate my friend goes youre perfectly fine youve fixated on this before and you survived it i was there and you were fine after a while youll be fine again sometimes when i start overthinking and going omg why am i so dizzy my friend literally goes you were dizzy like this three weeks ago water helped you last time try that and it works you can also make a symptoms diary and note whenever you get a symptom and how long it lasted what helped it go away when it comes back etc once i knew my heart palpitations were mostly a symptom of too much sugar and not enough water i can somewhat help myself further on my main point is sometimes ignoring the symptom only makes it worse and actually facing it and your fear surrounding it is the only way to get through it and that comes from someone who was so fixated on their heart and breathing that actually caused incredible stomach ache because i was breathing wrong for months because i couldnt stop fixating on the damn breathing i had to retrain myself how to breathe properly and to finally realise that fixating on a symptom is a symptom of itself a symptom that my health anxiety is acting up hope this helps,pre-pandemic
when the woman on the phone said she needed a reason why i was changing my number i felt scared what if my reason made her laugh so i told her it was for safety reasons she didnt laugh she just said okay and continued with her instructions my traumas keep piling up even though theyre years ago the trauma starts when i realize it so one is less than a year ago one is just a few months old even though they both happened within a month back in 201516 then theres the whopper that initially gave me ptsd id like that ones head on a spike tbh but all that aside they cant get a hold of me the ones i didnt get a chance to block the ones i did block it doesnt matter im untouchable for now and it feels amazing,pre-pandemic
hi rautism im a police officer verified on rleo and rprotectandserve i just finished a two hour autism and crisis intervention training class the class got me thinking and i want you hear from the asd community about how we the police can better serve you feel free to ask any questions,pre-pandemic
hi all i want to ask that you try to follow up on your posts in the comment section did you have a worrisome headache stomach ache test result etc and post about it come back later hours days weeks afterward and post about what happened how long did the symptom end up lasting how did you find relief what was the probable cause anxiety dehydration gas etc this is especially important if nothing happened that means that the symptom just resolved and youre okay do it for the others who may be struggling with the same worry and do it for yourself so you can look back on your past anxieties and see how they played out eventually your post history will become a record of selfassurance wait i know ive worriedposted about this before how did it turn out last time oh yeah the symptom went away in a few hours i think we can all learn a lot by looking at our anxiety in hindsight and being able to revisit our past worries and the corresponding closure,pre-pandemic

my experience is that 90 of the people who act like they are all evolved about mental illness act like they are supportive understanding and caring will bail on you in a heartbeat when you are manic i have actually done this to others my last 2 doctors have fired me after a manic episode because they couldnt handle me when i needed help the most even my wife i gotta admit i dont blame them its just a shitty dynamic for me anyone else but there were a few who ran toward me when i was suffering i thank god for them bill jill,pre-pandemic
its really weird for me like night and day when im manic or just relatively normalmood i read constantly and am super curious and passionate able to retain so much information but when i get depressed i just cant absorb any information and cant keep focused on anything for more than 30 seconds ugh,pre-pandemic
there was one night where and i had 0 reason to really believe this was logically true i believed i was having a full blown heart attack and could drop dead any second like i said there was very little logical basis to this i didnt want to go straight to the hospital again the process takes hours upon hours and i was determined to break the compulsive habit since i had gotten my heart checked out there not long ago at all and i was totally fine however i couldnt possibly stay home by myself i was driving myself up the walls with anxiety i kept feeling like i was dying instead i brought my laptop and sketchbook to this cafe thats open late near where i live i simply got a drink and sat there watching netflix and drawing and trying to distract myself this actually calmed me down substantially i was in a different environment and also there were other people around if i did somehow spontaneously pass out someone would call 911 being a part of societyreality so to speak also helped ground me rather than my brain speeding ahead into imagining dying the day after i was totally fine the discomforts i felt that triggered my anxiety the night before was gone after a night of sleep i had nearly worried myself sick but i was alive just a bit of advice i guess if home is too much and you dont want to go to emergency stay somewhere public,pre-pandemic

so my health anxiety is almost entirely grounded in cancer today im worried about lymphoma and brain cancer a month ago it was lung and digestive cancers before that leukemia and before that bone cancer you get the gist my dad was diagnosed with cancer and did pass away from it before you freak out he was older active but poor poor diet his whole life history of alcoholism i mention this because its good context for my issues my health anxiety spirals every year around this time janmar when he was sick even though i know many many statistics about age of diagnosis and general health and this and that it doesnt always stop the worrying as many of you are well aware i tend to catastrophise if i feel bad it must be cancer and since its cancer ill die a painful death in a couple months i typically avoid cancer stories as they trigger me up pretty badly duh but today i stumbled across a story of a 27 year old guy who was diagnosed with a rare brain cancer a few months ago today he announced he was cancerfree the world isnt perfect and it isnt always fair there are lots of what ifs but i think its so so so important to remember the what ifs are conjecture and not fact so you go through the thing your lymph nodes are swollen youre probably a little sick with a cold or maybe youve been poking your neck non stop for weeks to check so you probably dont have lymphoma okay but what if you do honestly youd probably be fine this is not always the case but if we go by percentages 99 of your worries are not cancer or malignant or serious at all 75 of that 1 of real and serious conditions respond well to treatment theres variance but this is a great time in history to have cancer treatments are so plentiful and effective maybe you do have brain cancer but so that 27 year old kid did hes alive and well to be abundantly clear i think its most important to challenge false conclusions first and foremost challenge your worries if youre in a rut though and you just cant shake the feeling that this time is has to be cancer i just know it has to be stay optimistic we are a community of worriers challenge yourself to think of best case scenarios even if theyre within the worst case im here with you if youre scared of something today and im so positive that we will get through it just fine i want you to be positive of that as well,pre-pandemic
i have moments almost every day where i feel completely suicidal that last anywhere from an hour to three hours ill search out pills fantasizeplan about overdosing relentlessly cry the works im actually really concerned for my safety during these times but then itll pass and ill be as normal as a lonely someone with bpd is i know that it feels extremely real and suicidal in the middle of the events but afterward it just seems like im faking it because im so normal and not depressed does anyone else get like this do i make any sense i feel like im exaggerating it and when i think about going to inpatient for help i doubt myself because im not constantly depressed,pre-pandemic
really fucking tragic i wish i could go back to 10 years ago its just not the right path,pre-pandemic

so from ages 13 to 15 i was groomed by a woman and i sent her hundreds of nsfw pictures which she sold on cp sites every since then i have a deathly fear of young women around the late teens early 20s age to the point where i dont let my 19 year old sister touch me or be in the same room as me but today today was different i let my sister hold my hand and i didnt freak out run away or cry i had anxiety the entire time but it wasnt a out burst like normal my therapist taught me to associate my sister with trust and how she would never try to hurt me and i did that i told myself in my head all she is doing is holding your hand thats it and it worked im so proud of myself i had to share it somewhere i know it might be dumb to some but for me it was amazing,pre-pandemic
my bro is just amazing he got up at 324 am and was jumping on my bed just making a big noise and so after i calmed him down we i my bro was opening and closing the microwave door a bunch so we brought our mom the tea and she thanked usand then my bro did something i never thought would happen he licked us in the face like 100000 times a form of him showing love and then he grabbed each of our hands and saidi love you and my autism is a gift but i use it sparingly i mean what in the world was that even my bro talking what do you think mature answers only please,pre-pandemic
ive been using this sub now for quite some time and honestly stopped being so active because i noticed this the more i used this sub to ask for advice about certain symptoms and behaviours it only got downvotes and negative replies and now i realise that people dont want to talk about the negative symptoms of bpd even other people with bpd this really grates on me and while i love this sub for support from others in the same boat i cant stand the fact that this should be our safe space and we still get shit for posting the things we wouldnt want to post to twitter or facebook x200b when people come here with a story about something negative they did or said they are looking for advice to change that behaviour to become a better person and fight that part of themselves no one comes here to glorify abusive behaviour so why are we all so against reading it and helping each other out the more we talk down on people who openly admit theyve done something wrong the more we add to our own stigma the more other people will begin to believe that we are all inherently toxic people and less people will be willing to reach out and ask for help x200b i feel like this sub needs a kick into gear surrounding this topic even if a seperate flair was created so anybody who doesnt needwant to see those posts ie partnersfamily members of those with bpd doesnt have to see them but anybody willing to read and understand and offer support and advice is welcome to in a safe and nonjudgemental space after all isnt that one of the major points of dbt no judgement remember that while reading these posts weve all made mistakes and done things we regret x200b please remember not everyone can affordhas access to therapy and counselling some of us need help from wherever we can get it and if you are fortunate enough to have access to therapy share the things you learn with others every little idea can help someone in need x200b thanks for reading if you made it this far,pre-pandemic
okay this sounds very weird and specific i know but over time ill get super obsessed with a showmovieactoretc and ill spend tons of time doing research watching it thinking about it drawing it writing about it etc in the moment ill finally be able to feel emotions and get happy sort of manic sometimes too but its a nice change from just feeling empty and depressed all the time but the second i finish it like finish watching the showmovie ill get super depressed and empty like worse than i felt beforehand does anyone else experience or relate to this i feel really alone,pre-pandemic
the good doctor is a medical drama about an autistic physician with savant abilities in surgery and medicine the show has been lauded for representing autistic people and showing that someone can still succeed in a field despite their disability however they have chosen a gentleman with savant abilities something that is only found in 10 of people with autism according to applied behavioural analysis edu as they call themselves anyway i thought that was fair enough until i saw the promo for the next episode in which he drives his partners muscle car without a licence his partner telling him you have autism you are not blind nearly smashing into a tree and later downs consecutive shots of tequila i have little knowledge of autism remember but i do recall hearing that autistic people dont take well to breaks of their routine i probably should have made that clear i have no idea how accurate the behaviours depicted in the show are of someone who actually has autism but it seems really suspicious that they are getting it seriously wrong the reception should always lie with sufferers and their families though so how do you see it,pre-pandemic
im not going to comment on posts trying to justify other peoples decisions im perfectly happy to give support to others and offer up my own experiences etc but when people are consistently making wrong decisions something needs reevaluating we need to take responsibility and not play the victim wed feel so much more empowerment and confidence if we did this,pre-pandemic
i honestly just really want someone to acknowledge the fact that my mom is finally clean she was an alcoholic who gave up her family job but she turned her life around and went to rehab i couldnt be more proud of her i just wanted to say to those who are struggling you are not a bad person you are simply just damaged and thats okay its okay to be sad its okay to be hurting im so proud of everyone who has stopped their addictiondisease and to the people who are struggling you got this its a lil stupid post but im happy,pre-pandemic
they have no idea i obsessively think about crashing my car almost every time i drive it they dont know that i live in complete fucking filth that my bedroom is piled with garbage and bags of garbage and bottles and cans everywhere and purchases from 6 months ago still with tags on and scattered items all leftover from 98 hobbies i took interest in for all but 5 minutes that ive been wearing the same pajama pants for 7 days and they literally fucking smell but you can bet i will put them back on again as soon as i get home and they have no clue how much deodorant and dry shampoo i use because i usually feel that i dont deserve to be clean and showered they think that im busy when im really just buried inside my trashed junked room barely existing they dont know that i like to peoplewatch from my window and i do it often that i find comfort in it because i rarely think that i deserve to exercise or even be outside that i binge eat and withhold food all the time they dont know about my thousands of credit card debt they dont know that lately ive been waking up more often than not with a severely intrusive urge to drink they dont know that when i found that mans wallet on the floor at the bar which i returned untouched it was full of large bills and i cried hard in the bathroom after because the voice was screaming steal it steal steal and the urge was so intense and the automatic rush made my head hurt they definitely dont know that i spend most of my time thinking about them how one minute i cry irrationally in fear for their lives and the next minute im digging my nails into my palms furiously brainstorming ways to ensure they never leave me they definitely dont know that i dont deserve any of them because i would rather be sad and alone than have to see their reactions to me pathetically admitting my devastation they dont know that i have no fucking idea who i am because i always forget if you actually got this far thanks for reading i wrote this earlier and chilled out a bit since fun fact after i wrote this my boyfriend gave me some attention and i was like wow im awesome im the bestright then he didnt answer my text for 20 min and i just knew for that 20 min that he was probably never going to talk to me again heres the shocker he was just fucking busy lol edit for a while it was really hard for me to reply to everyone for some reason and im really sorry but im ready now cuz ive been feeling a lot better started dbt and feel my meds working you guys have no idea how much i appreciate you thank you so much hugs to every single one of you xx,pre-pandemic

this is a reminder that you are not a doctor you are an individual who shares a headspace with an obnoxious and persistent roommate named anxiety you likely have little to no knowledge and training of how the human body and disease processes work your only source of information is google which provides you basic pieces of info but without any context at all to put the medical puzzle together with any accuracy and yet we are prone to listen to the anxiety when it whispers what if you have disease or you should google it and then we attempt to diagnose ourselves i see posts here often that say i have convinced myself that i have disease i have diagnosed myself with disease i am 100 certain that i have disease and to that i say you are not at all qualified to make that determination honestly imagine setting an appointment with a doctor going to your appointment and meeting the person who is supposed to diagnose and treat you imagine that person had never gone to medical school imagine that their only source of information was webmd imagine that they had dozens hundreds thousands of misdiagnoses on their track record and have only been correct once or twice if ever would you take them seriously or value their medical opinion at all next time your livein roommate anxiety decides to diagnose you remember that he is an absolute quack with no training and no credibility stop trusting the opinion of someone who isnt qualified to make a diagnosis,pre-pandemic
this is a little mantra i say to myself when im struggling with health anxiety it has helped me quite a bit with my own symptoms i am reasonably young healthy active etc so when i get a symptom of some looming catastrophe that can very reasonably be attributed to anxiety i make a conscious effort to assume it is only anxiety for me i experience shortness of breath chest tightness or pain numbness of arms or lips twitches sour stomach blurry vision throat tightness and others all of these can be caused by anxiety for me deciding to assume it is only anxiety and tell myself so has gone a long way to me moving through the symptoms and getting back to life of course this is coupled with no googling whatsoever no trips to the er or the doc without good cause etc id rather assume its anxiety and run the minuscule risk that i am some wild outlier than assume im the wild outlier and ruin day after day with allconsuming worry if you have reason to believe youre healthy and well maybe this little mantra can help you too health anxiety is difficult but missing out on the stuff of life is no good either good luck everyone one day at a time,pre-pandemic
its like i know im being melodramatic i know im not being rational i know im not making good decisions but theres like a naughty part of me who wants to drink and drug her feelings away and scream at the people she loves because shes 999 that everyone hates her and then begging for them to come back i think the worst part is when i let that part of me take over though when i get tired of fighting off crazy irrational thoughts and finally just give in i let anxiety anger depression and loneliness take hold and corrupt my thinking to the point that i can think of nothing else if they ever find some magical pill to make this shit go away hmu,pre-pandemic

if you are horribly burned in a fire you can take drugs to relieve the pain if you shatter your spine you can take drugs to relieve the pain if you are addicted to drugs and your life has turned to utter and total shit you can take drugs to relieve the pain and thats how the trap works imagine if the only cure for burn pain was fire imagine if the cure for back pain was whacking yourself in the spine with a hammer the drug addict is caught in an analogous situation the only fast reliable remedy for the psychological pain of drug addiction is drugs there are other cures a notable one is not doing drugs but they are all slower and less reliable somehow the lure of feeling better now overrides the hope of feeling better later this is the basic mechanism of addiction the behavior of an addict is perfectly logical in the short term and perfectly illogical in the long term because life exists in the long term addiction is illogical overall what is surprising how easily addiction can ensnare people who are perfectly intelligent and selfdisciplined you can go to certain parts of any sizable city in america and watch drugs addicts totter around looking at their blighted faces their filthy clothes their total lack of selfregard you would be forgiven for thinking that they lack selfdiscipline how could you think otherwise when a person cant be bothered to shower much less get a proper job or just stop smoking crack for more than a few hours what else could you call it but a lack of selfdiscipline imagine the nazi troops at stalingrad encircled by the soviet troops fighting against total annihilation would you look at these troops these underslept unshaven men in stinking unwashed clothes and accuse them of lacking selfdiscipline would you say tuttut these nazis are an undisciplined lot of course not you would understand that their shabby state is not from a lack of selfdiscipline but rather because they are concerned with other things dire things while there are several notable differences between nazi soldiers and crack heads the same principle is in effect for both for both there has been a terrible reordering of priorities the showering the clean clothes the job all of these become secondary to fast access to the drug if showering and clean clothes got them fast access to the drug they would walk around looking like a detergent commercial you would never see whites so white but they dont need clean clothes they dont need showers they need drugs the drugs are the solution to everything highly selfdisciplined people are actually quite vulnerable to drug addiction it is because they believe that they need to control their feelings they often seek to simply eliminate bad feelings just as they seek to eliminate underperformance from every other area of their lives the demon of addiction looks at their grand selfdiscipline and giggles with glee it knows that it will be precisely this selfdiscipline that will bring them to heel they will selfdiscipline themselves right into total obedience to the drug as an example look at prince and michael jackson were they selfdisciplined definitely the world has hardly seen such selfdiscipline they were obsessive workaholics devoted to their careers and they propelled themselves to the very pinnacle of professional success they both knew the dangers of drug addiction and fastidiously avoided drugs keep in mind avoiding drugs in 1980s hollywood must have been like avoiding water in a swimming pool at the bottom of the fucking ocean yet they managed to do it for a while because they had selfdiscipline now they are both dead they were both destroyed by drug addiction in the end selfdiscipline was not enough to save them why not because selfdiscipline is just a talent an accomplishment and like any other talent or accomplishment it can be turned and made to serve the dark master what then is our defense against this menace what is the answer,pre-pandemic
sleeping with another human in the room is a big struggle for me even worse if im sharing a bed with them and even worse with a new person but i had my first sleepover with my girlfriend we only held hands and then i cried and we built a blanket wall so we wouldnt have any accidental skintoskin contact but then i successfully fell asleep and slept through the night i almost always have to sneak off to the couch either because i cant get to sleep at all or because i woke up in the night and freaked out but im very pleased today just had to share my excitement with people who understand,pre-pandemic
so ive been using cocaine for 10 years it started off occasionally at parties but the last 5 years its been 46 times a month about half the time by myself and its been killing me anyway last night i was in a good mood and out of nowhere got slammed by a really strong craving i tried ignoring it for awhile but eventually decided to give in and i went to the atm and pulled out money but i didnt call the delivery guy i went home and just sat in my room trying to think my way out of it after about a half hour i went to bed fast forward to this morning and i just finished a run not long but longer and faster than 2 days ago i was listening to music and thinking about how good the exercise felt i started thinking about how if i had used last night id be lying in bed exhausted and desperate for sleep and id want to die i just got completely overwhelmed while running and started crying because i didnt have to go through that today and what i was doing was so much better i really want this to be the time i kick it for good im ready i need this,pre-pandemic
its so incredibly frustrating to know youre acting on emotion rather than logic but being unable to stop it its like im a passenger in my own brain and im trying to tell the driver who is also me to fuckin chill but they cant hear me i thought i didnt experience dissociation but sometimes when ive been in severe crisis mode during an episode i feel like im watching myself rage from outside of my body it feels very surreal and my rational mind is like stop youre making it worse but my emotional mind aka bpd has full control of my words and actions and is like oh you think thats bad hold my beer ive just been thinking about this recently because i relapsed just when i was doing so well but we all know that recovery isnt linear blah blah but its still so humiliating to know that i made a huge scene over something trivial fun fact alcohol does not help this situation my roommate and boyfriend could obviously see that i selfharmed too so that was also super embarrassing im so lucky they havent written me off yet but im determined to go the rest of the year without absolutely losing my shit,pre-pandemic

after two weeks its safe to say my health anxiety has dropped from a constant 810 down to a 01 it is simply amazing that i am fortunate enough to feel like a real person again the key erp therapy ive been seeing a therapist who specializes in ocd instead of general anxiety it has made all of the difference even though i feel normal again i am going to continue with the therapy for as long as she recommends so that i know how to manage it when and if it returns which it probably will in addition i have stopped googling symptoms altogether for the last 9 days which also has included visiting this subreddit and have been making an effort to get out socialize and do things to get my brain away from the ruminating thoughts please do yourself a favor and find a therapist that specializes in erp,pre-pandemic

addicts are all hypersensitive thats why we numb with the use of alcohol drugs or any other addictive behaviour this society is build with the idea everyone can make their dream come true if you work for it this is far from the truth still people keep supporting this system because they still have a great life addicts are the ones who suffer and get ridiculed every single day addicts are lazy dumb stupid simple people who are nothing of value for our great system what about our socalled leaders majority has no empathy has a fake face and just smiles fake it till you make it addicts are the most honest and sensitive people i came face too face with as long as society blames addicts for being weak and admires people who dont give 2 shits about human life addicts will keep dying more and more every single addict i met in my life had something special and were all very sensitive,pre-pandemic

so i dont know why but i know i was behaving very oddly walking around my apartment complex i got lost in my own complex a police officer showed up i guess someone called him because of me and started asking me a bunch of questions i was in psychosis but he may have thought something else was wrong so he wants me to take him to my apartment i go in im soooo out of it but this is where it really saves my ass i didnt realize it but i walked into the wrong fucking apartment it took me and even the officer a few minutes to figure out what was wrong i was 2 buildings down from my apartment nobody was there even though i heard people in their rooms the police officer figures this out and immediate starts asking how much did you have to drink today and i somehow remembered my schizophrenia medical alert card that i ordered when it got popular on this sub a few weeks ago i handed it to him and he made a face like uhh whats this but as soon as he saw it was a med id his whole demeanor automatically changed he became a lot more relaxed and understanding he just said come on lets get you home and walked with me and made sure i got home safely im so thankful for this card this interaction could have been so much worse i highly recommend getting one i never thought it would actually help me so much link to buy card link to get a card for free note that it takes a lot more time to get the card for free also if you can afford to buy it you should so that they can keep giving free ones to those who cant hugs edit wow thank you for the gold and silver,pre-pandemic
tldr stop drinking at all cost you may be so sick mentally that even if given a 2nd chance at life youd blow it again a change of heart is the only way you cannot out smart alcohol i just want to first say im 3 years in recovery i got lucky a dui set me on a better path i thank god i never hurt anyone but my wreckless behavior was going to to kill me soon had an intervention of the law not put me in check it wasnt easy i stumbled a sponsor and extra study groups and great people around me lifted me up im always in debt to these people rewind my drinking buddy at age 32 was in liver failure after a night locked in a room with wild turkey 101 and nyquil never mix alcohol and acetaminophen i think he was too drunk to realize nyquil had it in it yep so living with me and my wife at the time he did this he came down the stairs the next morning yellow has homer simpson a week later he was told he had one week he called me crying and as a friend begged me to stop drinking and i did for a while after doctors told him he would die soon he made it a month on a vent on dialysis fighting for his life and so close to death that his nose and fingers began deteriorating it was hard to watch then by my opinion god brought him back in a 24 hour period after a month of suffering he went from deathbed to sitting up speaking all we can say is miracle he got out from the hospital many weeks later and stayed sobor for about six months mind you he was on a liver transplant list at this time now on medicaid no on disability all from this single life event he was a hot mess financially and struggled when he realized he pretty much needed the disability for healthcare and hed never have a real job again at 42 he was driving his high school graduation present car to put it in perspective fast forward some and like i said he made it 6 months after being given life by grace of god imo before picking up the drink again he spent the next ten years tempting fate and drinking like nothing happened he had a new mix of serious pills from psychiatrist to play with now also with the drinking thanks doc for the record when he came out of the hospital after nearly dying he didnt come out the same man perhaps a touch of wet brain millions of brain cells destroyed by high amonia levels he was a little slower a little weirder it was to quote pop culture almost like pet cemeteryish they way he came back so different current days two weeks ago he got a gullstone blockage and infection his blood was so thin they couldnt operate his liver had made him so weak even if a brand new one was offered he couldnt take not that he qualified any more so slowly in pain he suffered eventually being put back to sleep and placed on a vent again and back on dialysis he made it five days and then sepsis and a damaged heart took him out so i came here tonight just to say alcohol takes lives everyday it almost took mine it look his i have to go see him buried in 48 hours alcohol isnt your friend its a cunning baffling addiction where you just cant stop because stopping means pain so it is the disease yet the cure in your mind for an endless loop of 24 hour periods we simply cant imagine a sober life as it seems like such a distant past but you can do it and if youre here suffering tonight and read this i promise you that aa can help only a true change of heart and mind can fix it otherwise eventually it will take you out or a complication caused by it will theres no magic pill or special trick to stop alcohol will steal everything from you if you cannot make some changes remember that so tomorrow if you are suffering struggling need help please go find a meeting let these people help hold you accountable and remember this sad story happens every day in someones life across this country 88000 people die from alcoholrelated deaths each year in the united states rstopdrinking,pre-pandemic
when the twelve steps dont work for you twelve steppers respond by saying its your fault you are too dishonest you are too lazy you are too arrogant headstrong actually the twelve steps just arent the answer for many people with addictions so maybe stop being a presumptuous dick let go of this belief that the twelve steps work for everyone unless theyre a lazy nogood arrogant liar its a bullshit belief and its offensive when the twelve steps dont work for you and you find something else that does work twelve steppers respond by saying you were never a real addict real addicts can only get sober through the twelve steps real addicts cant get sober any other way now recently ive heard twelve steppers try to claim that they dont actually believe that the twelve steps are the only way to recover the na basic text tells a different story we sought help and found none often doctors didnt understand our dilemma they tried to help by giving us medication our husbands wives and loved ones gave us what they had and drained themselves in the hope that we would stop using or would get better we tried substituting one drug for another but this only prolonged our pain we tried limiting our using to social amounts without success there is no such thing as a social addict some of us sought an answer through churches religions or cultism some sought a cure by geographic change we blamed our surroundings and living situations for our problems this attempt to cure our problems by moving gave us a chance to take advantage of new people some of us sought approval through sex or change of friends this approvalseeking behaviour carried us further into our addiction some of us tried marriage divorce or desertion regardless of what we tried we could not escape from our disease whats the takehome message here apart from the twelve steps nothing can help you we sought help and found none doctors cant help you doctors dont understand your dilemma medication cant help you your friends family will drain themselves in vain trying to help you switching drugs wont help you you have no hope of moderating other churchesreligionscults besides the twelve steps cannot help you moving cannot help you nothing can help you regardless of what we tried we could not escape from our disease this is the impression you get at twelve step meetings without these meetings youre fucked this is a lie feel free to stop going to meetings no one needs them unless theyre brainwashed into believing they need them so what happens when somebody with an addiction does find something that helps them from outside of the twelve step religion twelve steppers feel the need to neutralize the threat to their religious beliefs instead of accepting that some people with addictions can be understood helped by doctors by medication by moving by switching to marijuana by learning how to use lessthey protect their false belief by denying your experience of addiction you were never a real addict its fucked up its not right and it needs to change,pre-pandemic
its a bit of a hostile paraphrasing perhaps but wtf i really like zen pencils which are comics drawn around inspirational quotes but this part of the quote from james rhodes pisses me the fuck off youll know it when you see it to quote a world where people have simply surrendered to or been beaten into submission by the sleepwalk of work domesticity mortgage repayments junk food junk tv junk everything angry exwives adhd kids and the lure of eating chicken from a bucket while emailing clients at 8 pm on a weekend seriously seriously having a kid with adhd stops you from turning off the tv and practicing at something you claim to be passionate about try living your dream when you have a real problem you have no control over like uhm i dunno adhd noone gets to blame their kid with adhd for them not being able to live their dream having kids is voluntarily having kids takes time if you have kids they might have a disorder kids with disorders might take up more of your time these are all things any intelligent person is aware of before they make the decision to have children especially since theres probably a hereditary aspect to adhd you make your own bed you know who isnt to blame for any of the issues that arise from having a kid with adhd the kid they didnt ask to be born they certainly didnt ask to have a neurological disorder that almost seems designed to keep them being able to work stop using them as an excuse as to why youre not getting off your ass to practice the piano learn to draw or write that novel youre always talking about because that is exactly what they are excuses take it from someone who knows people with adhd know all about excuses and procrastination yet we still struggle to get shit done in spite of everything i am still an artist i work on my craft every single day i have practiced for years and years and i get my share of wistful i wish i could draw comments when people look at my work and for years i naively offered to help with books tips websites youtube tutorials and even free private lessons both offline and on you know what 99 of those people turned me down they had nothing to lose but a bit of time and effort a pencil and some paper and they still went nah and the 1 quickly tapered off into being an hour too late for their classes and not doing their tiny amount of simple homework sitting around talking nonstop instead like it was a social event i learned that i wish i could x just means i wish i could x without putting any effort in so now i just smile and nod when people tell me they wished they could draw and save my tiny amount of previous energy and focus on practicing my craft every single day tldr if you cant even turn off the tv to make time to practice what youre supposedly passionate about maybe you dont deserve to achieve your dreams,pre-pandemic

thats usually a pretty reliable indicator that something isnt quite right about your drinking its a question that gets asked a lot on the recovery subreddits so with that in mind i thought id put together a list of selfassessment questions that can help someone who is questioning whether they have a drinking problem to more closely examine the nature of the relationship they have with alcohol the first questionnaire comes from the dsm5 the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders which is the current standard for diagnosing alcohol use disorder this is the modern medical term for a range of problematic drinking behaviour covering both alcohol abuse and alcohol dependence and is a progressive condition with predictable stages that gets worse over time the more and longer someone drinks under the dsm guidelines anyone meeting any two of the 11 criteria during the same 12month period receives a diagnosis of alcohol use disorder the severity of an aud is graded mild moderate or severe nbsp mild the presence of 2 to 3 symptoms moderate the presence of 4 to 5 symptoms severe the presence of 6 or more symptoms nbsp in the past year have you nbsp had times when you ended up drinking more or longer than you intended more than once wanted to cut down or stop drinking or tried to but couldnt spent a lot of time drinking or being sick or getting over the aftereffects experienced craving a strong need or urge to drink found that drinking or being sick from drinking often interfered with taking care of your home or family or caused job troubles or school problems continued to drink even though it was causing trouble with your family or friends given up or cut back on activities that were important or interesting to you or gave you pleasure in order to drink more than once gotten into situations while or after drinking that increased your chances of getting hurt such as driving swimming using machinery walking in a dangerous area or having unsafe sex continued to drink even though it was making you feel depressed or anxious or adding to another health problem or after having had a memory blackout had to drink much more than you once did to get the effect you want or found that your usual number of drinks had much less effect than before found that when the effects of alcohol were wearing off you had withdrawal symptoms such as trouble sleeping shakiness irritability anxiety depression restlessness nausea or sweating or sensed things that were not there nbsp before i stopped drinking i answered yes to every single one of these questions which i wrote about in more detail in this post i dont have an alcohol use disorder any more but i know exactly how i could get one again really quickly the second questionnaire is based on one that appeared in drinking a love story by caroline knapp which i have expanded and added some questions of my own to nbsp do you use alcohol primarily for its moodaltering effects to make yourself feel confident and sociable or less anxious for the euphoric buzz to relax to shut off your thoughts or help you sleep to numb or change difficult feelings like boredom loneliness or emotionalphysical pain or to turn down the dial on sensory inputs etc do you sometimesoftenalways have trouble stopping drinking once youve started do you find that one or two drinks just isnt enough to get the effect youre looking for do you also tend to use other moodaltering substances or processes in a similar way if alcohol isnt available or in combination with alcohol eg nicotine sugar junk food caffeine kratom prescription or recreational drugs shoppingspendinghoarding gambling internetpornsexgaming work exercise bingingpurging selfharm etc are you playing addiction whackamole have you stopped using one or more of the above because it had become problematic only to find that something else popped up in its place is there a history of addictive behavior of one sort or another in your close family are you drinking more frequently or in larger amounts than you used to did you start experimenting with alcohol or other substances at an early age before the age of about 25ish when the brain has finished developing whats your ace score like are you using alcohol to selfmedicate conditions such as anxiety depression loneliness social anxiety or shyness adhd autism bipolar ptsd ocd chronic stress grief etc have you always felt somehow different and found it hard to connect with other people are you drinking to fit in or fill up a sense of inner emptiness do you wonder how other people seem to be able to have a couple of drinks and then stop without a second thought and ask yourself why you cant have you noticed that you seem to drink a lot more than other people around you and have a higher tolerance for alcohol than they do have you ever said something like i dont want to stop drinking altogether i just need to figure out how to control it and learn how to drink like a normal person do you sometimes find yourself drinking when you told yourself you wouldnt have you tried implementing all sorts of rules and schemes to cut down or moderate your drinking like switching brands or types of alcohol promising to only drink on special occasions stopping for a while just to prove that you can etc only to find that it didnt really work for very long and your drinking eventually got out of hand again have you tried every method you can think of to avoid minimize or cure hangovers up to and including the infamous hair of the dog remedy have you spent a lot of time talking to god on the big porcelain telephone after drinking too much or spent days recovering and swearing never to drink again until the next time have you ever lost control of your bladder or bowels due to drinking or peed in strange places conversely has it ever been a point of pride that you never really get hangovers or have you noticed that you dont seem to get hangovers as badly as you used to do you tend to surround yourself with other people who drink like you do does most of your social life revolve around alcohol is drinking closely linked to your hobbies or your job have you ever lied to a doctortherapistpolicemanfriendloved one etc about your drinking or got in trouble with the law because of your drinking duis etc do you find lots of ways to rationalize minimize or justify your drinking well im not that bad i dont drink in the mornings it doesnt really affect me its not affecting anyone else i deserve a drink everybody drinks red wine is good for you the recommended drinking limits are ridiculously low nobody bothers about those i only drink beer its normal to drink like this in college i still manage to get to work every day i need it to steady my nerves im a better version of myself when i drink im not a mean drunk people would think im boring if i didnt drink i cant possibly stop right now not with event involving drinking coming up i just need something to take the edge off soandso drinks more than i do and they seem fine etc etc have you ever hidden alcohol smuggled alcohol in or out of somewhere or had to get creative when disposing of the empties so that others wont see them or found other cunning ways to disguise your consumption from loved ones switching to bagged wine home brewing putting alcohol in a water bottle or coffee cup keeping a nearlyfull decoy bottle on public display while secretly swigging from the one you have stashed in the toilet cistern etc do you rotate the shops where you buy alcohol so that the staff wont judge you or claim that you are stocking up for a party when in fact its all for your own consumption do you only buy enough alcohol at a time to get you through that day because if you bought extra youd drink that as well do you find that sometimes the alcohol you bought wasnt enough and you have to go and find more have you ever felt the need to drink whatever sort of alcohol you could get your hands on if your primary tipple of choice wasnt available or had run out the cooking wine the strange bottle of banana liqueur left over from christmas that noone else wanted the ouzo that someone brought back from holiday the vanilla extract the hand sanitizer the mouthwash etc do you often or usually drink alone do you often drink on an empty stomach in order to feel the effects more quickly do you sometimesoften drink before or during work or drink and drive do you drink heavily when you are disappointed or have had a quarrel with someone or when youre in a good mood and want to lift your spirits even further when you are stressed or feel under pressure do you tend to drink more heavily than usual do you drink to cope with traumatic events you have experienced can you handle more alcohol now than when you first started to drink do you do a lot of careful arithmetic to work out the best abv price ratio when purchasing alcohol have you switched to cheaper brands or stronger drinks to get the effect youre looking for more economically do you spend a lot of time planning and working out how much you can drink and when or avoid making commitments at times when you know youll be drinkinghungover do you sometimes worry that other people will smell alcohol on you and find various ways to try and cover it up have you convinced yourself yet that vodka doesnt really have a smell have you memorised the licensing hours of every establishment that sells alcohol within a 10mile radius so as not to get caught short without enough booze to get through have you ever been unable to remember part of the previous evening even though your friends say you didnt pass out are these memory blackouts happening more frequently than they used to have you ever lost or damaged important personal possessions while drinking heavily keys wallet phone coat bag shoes car etc or injured yourselfsomeone else or had to go to hospital because of your drinking when drinking with other people do you try to have a few extra drinks when others wont know about it do you pregame by having a few drinks before you go to an occasion involving drinking or drink moderately when out with other people then rush home for a proper drink afterwards have you ever vomited after drinking too much and then continued to drink more known in the trade as the tactical chunder do you sometimes feel uncomfortable if alcohol is not available or avoid activities where you know you wont be able to drink are you in more of a hurry to get your first drink of the day than you used to be does the first one barely touch the sides on the way down when youre not drinking do you spend a lot of time thinking about having your next drink does life seem empty and boring when youre not drinking have you lost interest in other activities you used to enjoy do you sometimes feel a bit guilty or ashamed about your drinking has a family member or close friend expressed concern or complained about your drinking did you continue to drink anyway do you get defensive when people bring up your drinking do you often want to continue drinking after your friends say theyve had enough or after other people say that youve had enough do you usually have a reason for the occasions when you drink heavily when youre sober do you sometimes regret things you did or said while drinking do you tend to post nonsense on social media or send inappropriate emailstextsmake phone calls while under the influence and then desperately wish the next day that you hadnt or make wildly unsuitable choices in romantic partners due to drinking get into fights become verbally or physically abusive towards other people or do other riskyembarrassingdangerous things that you wouldnt otherwise dream of doing while sober have you ever tried to control your drinking by changing jobs or partners or moving to a new location do you try to avoid contact with family or close friends while you are

problems as a result of your drinking do more people seem to be treating you unfairly without reason do you eat very little or irregularly during the periods when you are drinking is the food you do eat mostly beige ie lots of late night kebabs takeaways highlyprocessed fast food greasy carby hangover food etc do you have various niggling health complaints like aches and pains brain fog skin problems acid reflux digestive problems high blood pressure excess weight palpitations sleep problems night sweats etc do you spend a lot of time googling symptoms to try and find something to blame it on other than your drinking do you sometimes get terribly worried about your health do your bowel movements resemble a flock of bats leaving the roost at dusk do you sometimes have the shakes in the morning and find that it helps to have a little drink tranquilizer or medication of some kind do you use lots of caffeine to counteract the effects of the alcohol and viceversa have you recently noticed that you cant drink as much as you used to do you sometimes stay drunk for several days at a time do you sometimes feel very depressed and hopeless and wonder if life is worth living do you

it is causing do you find it hard to imagine what your life might be like if you didnt drink do you imagine that life without alcohol must be a boring joyless existence do you spend a lot of time on the internet filling in questionnaires about having a drinking problem and lurking on forums about alcohol addiction nbsp if youre concerned enough to be here asking the question and youre answering yes to the above more often than not its probably safe to assume that your drinking is a problem or is likely to become one dont worry though help is at hand and you can recover recognising that you

hey everyone im doing a lot better than when i started i saw someone a few months ago lament that those who recover leave the subreddit so we never learn how to get better i promised that when i recovered id try to contribute so here is my attempt many of us have likely searched for can anxiety cause x y or z in an attempt to comfort ourselves that our symptoms are mental not physical so i am providing a list of physical symptoms anxiety has caused me with most of these i have sought medical help with all of these enough time has based that it is surely not cancer strokes terrible infectious disease or some awful thing causing it thus anxiety or some benign spurious cause is the most likely culprit perhaps others could comment with their physical symptoms as well 1 head aches 2 really bad head aches 3 pressure in my head as if i were underwater or in an airplane 4 tingling on the side of my head on my face fingers and toes 5 a bizarre tingling sensation crawling down my face 6 both arms legs and my face feeling like they are falling asleep simultaneously 7 feelings of being disconnected with reality 8 certainty that some terrible healthrelated catastrophe will strike me within seconds 9 dizziness 10 intense vertigo lasting up to eight hours per day 11 heart palpitations 12 chest pains 13 blurring throbbing peripheral vision 14 random tingling almost numbish spots 15 tingling sensations shooting down my arms when i move them 16 waking up with my arms legs eyeballs and tongue moving rhythmically 17 symptoms resembling a urinary tract infection decrease strength of urine stream increased frequency of urination pain in the bladder area bladder feeling more full relative to how much i urinate with a clean urinalysis and urine culture 18 stomach pains diarrhea and also gastrointestinal symptoms 19 extreme discomfort and feelings of sensoryoverload with light and sound 20 dozing off then snapping back into reality forgetting what had happened 21 forgetfulness including of recent events how did that get there 22 thinking it is the wrong year 23 difficulty falling asleep 24 difficulty waking up 25 exhaustion 26 scary things happening while i work out making me think im having a stroke heart problems or something wrong with my head 27 mood changes 28 depression 29 muscle cramps 30 sexual dysfunction 31 weight loss even when taking a break from diet and exercise im not telling anyone not to get things checked out but as my neurologist told me anxiety can mimic virtually anything physically i also want people to know that i am doing really well right now despite having very crippling extreme health anxiety in the past prayer therapy and medication have helped me recover a lot i am even weaning off one of my medications now in the past i was able to wean off everything and stayed healthy for years im currently recovering from a relapse let me know if you have any questions ive been incredibly blessed by this subreddit and would count it a personal blessing to pay it forward and help those who went through went i went through i dont consider myself a very strong person so i really think if i can get through it you can too,pre-pandemic
mom i never thought id be writing this for years i saw you as a disappointment a women who lost control of herself and found it in a bottle for years i believed you replaced me with that bottle i hated you you hated me i lost you around the age of 8 you were never the same you remembered nothing and spoke unkindness toward me you drank at all hours at all times it still shocks me how you were able to keep a job my father your husband did nothing to help you he let you drown yourself thats not love my sister and i were so angry and hurt we became vile with our words and actions we didnt know how to love i never knew how to help you i was in too much pain i never knew what to do to help you stop drinking im sorry that i yelled at you im sorry that we hurt each other so much pain has been transferred in this family we have caused each other so much suffering in the past sept 2018 i began changing my ways no more yelling no more screaming just love and compassion we had never tried this method before lets be honest our family was not the type to dish out unconditional love we all were defensive with one another maybe thats why we all ran from one another i hid with insecurities and comedy my sister with food and makeup dad with lies and work you hid with a bottle we ganged up on you your vice was the most overt im sorry we took our shit out on you when you were hurting just as much i started loving you unconditionally and thats when everything changed you started opening up more little by little you kept drinking but you were waking up you started telling me things that you have never told me about your childhood i didnt know about your sexual abuse i didnt know how you grew up feeling betrayed and scared im sorry i love you my unconditional love and understanding was not enough i knew your soul was suffering but you were still gripped by immense pain you couldnt let go of the bottle it wasnt until that fateful day in june when we almost lost everything you woke up your ego needed to be shook to the core for the message to truly sink in we talked about spirit trauma and pain we both understood that pain drove the drinking not disease of course not everyone may agree with this but hey this is for you not them mom almost one year ago you quit drinking and havent touched a drop since you are 56 and you have begun a new life again you have started all over and i cannot express how proud i am of you i still cry thinking about it every day i see you i see the light come back into you it was not easy at first lord knows we were all on edge the pain of the past was coming back fierce and formidable you stayed strong of course we all slip and get nasty but we always come back learning from it you started working out you started praying you started doing things for yourself you have never done before im not saying everyday is a cakewalk but shit you have certainly become my inspiration we cry together now we hold each other and share love through each others embrace because we know what it feels like to be in the dark scared i see myself in you and you see yourself in me we mirror one another the other day you cried because you said how you wished to go back to my childhood years and start all over i cried with you not because i lost my childhood i already forgave that but because now we have a lifetime to make beautiful memories together we have talked so much about all of this i know you know everything im writing mom youre my hero you are the strongest woman i have ever met you personify resilience and emanate love we dont expect perfection from one another just love unconditional love who knew that was the cure to it all if you told the family two years ago that unconditional love and understanding would save your life we would have laughed now i cant see living in a family without it im 24 now i got my mom back i got my family back day by day we open up more and more cant have rainbows without rain i love you to the moon and back mom x200b your daughter m,pre-pandemic

i assume no one will ever actually listen to it but what the hell here we go anyway i just thought itd be nice for anyone out there who has gone far too long without hearing anyone speak to them its 3am so when i wake up im probably going to forget that i recorded this but uh enjoy edit as cliche as it sounds i did not expect a response like this thank you all for the kind words i am not the best when it comes to accepting praise or compliments as my minds first instinct to reject them for some reason but im trying to get better at it most of all im just glad to know that my goofy little message potentially helped someone out there who needed it in the moment,pre-pandemic
im just venting here ive had ha for several years now and sometimes its unbearable but there are of course things that make it easier like sleeping more prozac eating healthier etc but man do i wish i could just be normal have a drink and not think twice about alcohol causing heart palpitations staying up really late without worrying about what symptoms ill have in the morning not having to agonize over every food i put into my body because of what the health effects could be sometimes im so jealous and mad at people who dont have to experience this kind of anxiety day in and day out like it must be nice to not worry about imminent death or fatal diseases all the time on a positive note prozac and therapy have changed my life and even though theres no cure i highly suggest self care cutting out googling symptoms and diseases and exercise i made this post mostly because im in the middle of a relapse and feeling pretty salty about it,pre-pandemic
in 40some years i have treated many people with adhd and so far every single one every one of you felt in their core that there was something just deeply fundamentally wrong with them that they were inherently bad somehow just bad people every single one my therapist is in her 70s she wasnt fucking around i had never directly expressed feeling that way but fuck she cut right to the core of me ive felt this way my entire life like i was just bad inside hurtful damaging just to be around that if people could see inside me they would hate me too fuck i feel like something has shifted in my head i touch that feeling and it doesnt feel real any more i dont know i hope even one person could feel like i felt learning that this feeling isnt me im not a bad person fuck man,pre-pandemic

day like18 or 19 ive lost count of being in the medical 2 major surgeries hospital you all first of all have been my main support system to get through this hard time having bipolar and going through these trying times of pain and loneliness today my nurse took me outside the hospital in a wheelchair to the water fountain she bought me some starbucks coffee we sat together and chatted about uplifting things she didnt know i was having a bad day i had already cried like three times before then i felt hopeless i felt a mood swing coming on im on an antibiotic currently that makes latuda less effective but her act of kindness completely turned around my day im ever so grateful to her and it was a busy day here too with like 17 more surgeries coming in yet she made the time for me i want to thank all medical staff for those extra things you do for your patients you might have no idea what theyre going through and one small act of kindness might change everything i just wanted to share a good thing that happened,pre-pandemic
look i got all this and i see some people who have just got add or adhd complaining about not being able to do collage high school because of various reasons i understand that i was bullied chronically when i was younger too i am now 2425 years of age now when i was 14 i wanted to kill myself i had the stereotypical drunk abusive step dadcan imagine the things he would do at school i couldnt play football because of my dyspraxia so i wasnt cool due to this i was bullied by the popular athletic kids whilst also being shunned by the ones who shared my interests in areas such as anime and games so i was alone at home and at school so what did i do i studied studied again till i understood the continued to study i didnt have a lot at home but i had my books yes no where was safe but it wasnt nearly as bad as id like to remember one thing ive realised from talking to many people with adhd which also includes myself we like to dramatise everything be our relationships our friendships or even traits but getting side tracked i kept my head down realising that if life is a game then knowledge is your exp more you know more you can do fast foreword 4 years start sixth formcollage jockey kids get bad grades and cant continue so i get a clean slate due to all new faces learn how to talk to people properly become popular i guess every talks and knows who i am which is good i even get in a few relationships which lead to intimacy i take up the biggest course i can find triple award engineering triple award 3d design a level maths with further and a level physics my work ethic doesnt change i managed to get d in my btecs and bs in my a levels ive carved out a very small friend group now to this day we still all talk and play games i gained valuable experience with relationships and know i wont be a wet fish when it comes to dating now so whats next a job or university i still lived at home during this point and my step dad hadnt changed i would often stay till closing times to avoid him and study then go to a friends because of this i had signed onto university an electronic engineering beng program i beat all the requirements by a lot so i didnt worry i did get a phone call from them though because of my grades i had been switched to an integrated masters giving me charter ship if i finish the course and work for a year so i do it i struggle i struggle hard with it what i failed to mention is that since about the 14 year old mark i stopped taking tablets i wanted to do this in my control not the tablets but i realised at this point that the tablets arent a hindrance they are there to help me concentrate i pass my integrated masters with a 1st my placement year offer to take me on full time work there for two years take savings and invest market shares stocks turn profit snowballs till i have 30000 take the money and create a start up now owner of my own electronic company with financial backing i wanted to create this post to show people that your disability as people call them arent some sort of affliction which needs to be medicated its a part of you it is you use it as a drive yes sometimes we have to work harder half an hour homework could take me an excess of 2 hours but eventually it took me 10 minutes i live in a studio flat with my wife overlooking most of the city every time i look over im reminded of the crap ive had to go through to get here damn i earned it though adhd isnt a curse its just a debuff which means we have to try twice as hard i hope this helped someone and either if you want to be a chef or artist you may have to try harder but when you get to everyone elses level youll outshine them because of your creativity have a lovely day everyone and keep your chins up youre all awesome,pre-pandemic
honestly wtf is wrong with people i just came across a post and not the first of its kind i might add of someone basically questioning why bipolar people suffer instead of just managing it wtf everyones situation is different some people are too afraid of judgment some people are too afraid of being committed to the hospital some people dont have health insurance some people cant even get out of fucking bed dont come here and question why we cant just get our mental health perfectly stable no one on earth who suffers with their mental health wants to feel this way the internet is a sick fucking place this subreddit shouldnt piss anyone off or offend anyone if you need an education open a fucking book dont come on here questioning people like were asking for this ugh,pre-pandemic
so i have quiet bpd which ive heard used interchangeably with highfunctioning bpd but i absolutely cannot stand the term highfunctioning to me it feels like an invalidation of my daily struggles sure i get up i go to class i have a 40 i have a job im doing just fine on the outside but in reality im constantly battling suicidal thoughts the shocks of emotional highs and lows throughout the day leave me drained the reason i do well in workschool is because i have no concept of who i am or my worth unless someone is giving me an a or an award or saying good job i question whether my boyfriend is gonna leave me every single day im not highfunctioning im just suffering quietly does anyone else feel this way,pre-pandemic
i dont expect you to read this just need somewhere to vent here i am again sitting alone in front of my tiny space heater trying to find a reason to keep going it doesnt help that its christmas eve im basically a 24 year old virgin and have spent holidays alone for the past 5 years i remember bill burr said at like 39yrs old he stopped going home for the holidays i envy that at 18 i went to college across the country to get away from my abusive mother even picked a college she hated it would embarrass her speaking of college im still unsure whether i was molested its hard to say when you wake up to some guy in your bed the not knowing really pisses me the fuck off to this day my mom doesnt think shes done any wrong after i dropped out i went back home for a little bit i dont know what i expected a year or two later i move across the country again to get away now i am truly and utterly alone im currently on my 22nd or 23rd deadend job honestly cant believe ive lasted so long at this one i guess i look up to the store manager a lot and dont want to let him down ive seen a hundred therapists been on a million different meds went to rehab for 6 months and i feel worse now than i ever have depression anxiety paranoia theyre all too minor to describe what i feel had my first suicidal thought at 9yrs old at that same age i realized i wanted a girlfriend it was like there was a hole in my heart i think i just wanted a female in my life because i hated my mother but i knew i was too young and figured id get one later in life nope never been in a real relationship i was with a girl in high school for a couple months maybe we sorta had sex once but i wouldnt even call it that every girl ive tried to pursue since either wasnt interested or i didnt try hard enough didnt have enough experience to understand what they wanted me to do doesnt help that i grew up afraid of my mother and hating her in college i was so desperate to get laid i went on craigslist casual encounters when that was a thing but girls from my floor found those pictures and passed them around that shattered the little confidence i had that is just one experience but probably the one that most changed my perspective of women i wish i could tell those girls how much damage theyve done then all my fuckups with girls just added to my pain dating apps dont work its like my account is invisible at this point i dont try whatsoever its as if ive been conditioned to not make a move and the ironic part is i look like a model genes muscles sixpack dress well and im actually very smart the few parties ive ever gone to girls basically threw themselves at me and i would freak out have a panic attack and then leave alcohol didnt help im not gay im just broken a beautiful girl might look at me and give all the signs that she wants me to talk to her she might even come talk to me first ill just shut down afterward ill get angry at myself so ive stopped going places where i might meet a girl because i know whats going to happen ive always found it interesting how much i relate to ugly guys who wont pursue a woman because they know what will happen and those guys take one look at me and hate me its like theyre thinking man if i could just trade places with that guy hahaha aint shit would change man youd be just as alone and maybe feel worse than you already do at this point the only reason i havent shot myself in the face is because of my dog my cat wouldnt give a shit but i cant do that to my dog i just cant the sad part though is dogs vibe off you and adopt your personality meaning hes gone from an angel to anxious and quick to fight other dogs so maybe itd be for the best if he had a different owner cant exactly take him to the dog park anymore and im sure you can tell how close i am to suicide because i know exactly where to shoot for your sake ill spare the details i dont know why im writing this i guess the holidays are pushing me over the edge i just cant be alone anymore the girl i like is a coworker who shut me down for a different coworker who went and cheated on her and now i feel like maybe shes expecting me to make another move i dont know but the way i am im not gonna pursue a girl who shut me down you know how hard it was to tell her how i feel couldnt even do it in person had to send some stupid message now i have to see her every day i guess thats why you dont ask out people from work i have panic attacks every night and the thin walls in this ghetto apartment complex do not help nor do the gunshots down the street i have no one to call my dad kind of understands what im going through but theres only so much he can handle every time i talk to him i feel like hes about to have a heart attack my brother says i have an illness that just needs to be treated i feel like he thinks i just want attention obviously i dont talk to my mom i actually blocked her and the suicide hotline dont get me started its like they want you to die the two real friends i had forgot about me once they found girlfriends i dont know how much time i have left and i always thought i was destined for big things youre all i have left reddit you and my dog shit the cat probably wants me gone if you read this far thank you from the bottom of my heart edit thank you everyone this was more helpful than rehab and yes i love my cat hes actually really interesting basically a reallife garfield edit 2 i think dave chappelle said it best when he talked about anthony bourdain thats why i used that title i cant stand when people think i have it all so how can i be so unhappy anyway thank you again everyone and thank you for the platinum whatever it means that made my day edit 3 i am either delusional or my coworkers read this post not sure which is worse but it really feels like one of them read it and passed that shit along like a hot potato i hear them talking and i hope its just confirmation bias but it sounds like theyre talking and laughing about what i wrote why are you laughing you fucks more gossip to gobble up one of the guys here tried to have a real talk with me how bad are these intrusive thoughts getting i havent been acting different at work why would he ask me that i did have people contact me saying they werent on this sub but found it just scrolling through rall so i dont know how many people actually read this i guess its possible someone i know came across it funny that i care when im so close to ending it all glad i got it off my chest though was a huge weight lifted and the support from you guys was unreal i didnt respond to everyone but i read every single message and comment speaking of which you trolls can go fuck yourselves it takes a special kind of twisted fuck to hide behind a keyboard and say that shit but it turns out this post helped some people thats such a foreign feeling for me i didnt believe them i dont know why im still writing i just hate being me need this life shit to end,pre-pandemic
i just dont want anything to do with them i feel embarrassed when i see them i guess part of it is cause ive changed since then and others have seen my manic episodes i literally hate going back to old work places and i usually refuse even when i need to its not like i made any lasting friendships there and i just feel awkward about doing it i guess the outcome is theyll either talk to me and see what ive been up to which i cant be bothered with or theyll just straight up ignore me because we werent close and that could potentially get to me i guess for old friends i think its more to do with social media activity when manic im scared to use facebook if i was to update my facebook i could only put up a picture or something incase my sense of humour went over peoples ahead or they start questioning why im updating my status and reacting as they do when im manic i downloaded twitter but then realised to actually enjoy it you should have some people following you back without having friends you might aswell just enjoy reddit which im doing i am down to no friends because i sort of wanted that i have no burning desire to make new friends i mean it would be cool to say i have some but i dont actually see the point i have a gf anyway so guess thats enough,pre-pandemic
ive been a heavy alcoholic for about two years now since my engagement dissolved since then i must have gone across the street to the liquor store over 600 times this time was my last i think i was in the store for the second time in one day and the cute girl at the cash register said well they always come back i got red in the face and quickly paid for my beer and left the thing is i dont have to go back again i can stop i just called the rehab center ive gone to before and am going in on wednesday ive had enough its time to make a change this one isnt coming back again,pre-pandemic
ive never known a life without trauma the first one happened when i was a month old i dont remember it but the effects still linger to this day obviously that means that ive lived my 9999 of my life with trauma i had other traumas happen throughout toddler hood childhood and into my teens im sad that ive never known what it is like to be completely carefree and without damage despite being on better terms with my past a small part of me wants to live in a life where my traumas never happened,pre-pandemic

so im in the middle of a cycle started new medication cause the old ones stopped working and i feel like i have no support i was diagnosed young 12years old im 27 now i hold down a job relationship friendships and hobbies etc though right now im barely hanging on whenever i reach out to friends and family they just blow me off saying things like well you can control it and you are okay you are not a kid anymore or your not that person anymore and the thing is just because i dont show it as obviously as i did when i was younger i still feel all the same feelings when im manic now i take my prn and try to work off my energy with activities when im depressed i reach out use my coping skills im just getting by now and have been for months and im so god damn tired idk i feel like no one takes me seriously cause ive been doing well for so long i feel like my world is crashing down all around me and i tell my loved ones exactly how i feel and they dont care im really struggling bad now i find myself isolating because why even bother reaching out when im just constantly invalidatedcan anyone relate i am proud of myself and i have come a long way i am so grateful and thankful for even having a life i never thought id make it to 18 let alone 27 it just really hurts deeply that because i work my ass off managing my illness my feelings my moods my thoughts are no longer taken seriously i feel really lost and alone,pre-pandemic
i tried i really did but the second i took the pills i instantly regretted it i called 911 in the ambulance is when i really noticed what i had done and having the paramedics there to calm me down and help me was everything to me im currently in the hospital i cant leave my room unless its to go to the bathroom i cant even close my curtain to get privacy they took every single cable and metal object out of the room im in terrible pain i didnt sleep at all last night hospital beds are the worse i miss my bed and my dog despite the dreary scene of the hospital the nurses and doctors have been nothing but nice and supportive the nurse who drew my blood even drew a little smiley face on my bandaid to cheer me up a little one nurse even gave me her number in case i ever need some support ive never been treated so nicely by a group of strangers every single one of them giving me a different purpose to live thankfully i didnt ingest too much pills to damage my body too much just slight kinda damage but nothing life threatening but this has made me realize a lot life really is worth living no matter your situation there are plenty of people who can be there for you every single nurse and doctor here gave me thousands of resources to help me and this has given me the will to live i should be getting out by tuesday when a psychiatrist comes to mentally evaluate me and give me permission to leave until then im in a hospital room prison being watched over like a baby but its good to know that theres people out there who truly care to all the people considering suicide please dont do it its not worth it i truly thought i had no one and my family wouldnt care but seeing their crying faces when the ambulance took me away made me realize that even when you think you have no one youre wrong the selfish decision i made will be in my mind forever but it gives me a reason to go on were all strong enough if we really try stay strong and reconsider your choice edit i didnt think my post would get so much attention seeing as my other posts wouldnt get much im sorry if i cant reply to all of the comments its really a lot however thank you to all the kind people and positive messages im glad to see my story is helping others as well,pre-pandemic
i am so happy that im not the only one with extreme health anxiety i have sank to my lowest because of this awful thing our brains do to us it is almost unbearable it got to the point where living seemed like such a job and a pain i have had 30 office visits this year and plenty of erurgent care visits and im telling you no one not even a doctor could tell me i wasnt dying no one could tell me i didnt have cancer didnt have a blood clot a brain tumor etc i was never like this i can actually pinpoint the tipping moments that created this anxiety things are better now the stress that health anxiety brings is unlike anything ive ever experienced and to know that there are others like you guys that feel what i feel is reassuring and is like a light at the end of the tunnel remember to stay away from google thank you all,pre-pandemic
anyone else tone down your femininitysexuality to prevent sexual abuse i stopped dressing feminine wore baggy clothes channeled my masculine energy to scareintimidate men so i dont get sexual attention yeah i did this and also when i was covertly sexually abused by my dad instead of protecting me my mom got jealous and stopped taking me to get my hair done and wouldnt let me get my nails done even though she had originally promised i looked unkempt growing up and now at 27 that i know what happened to me and have come to reality with the abuse i went through i have no sex drive and have no interest in flirting and emitting sexual energy towards other men also when i have flirted in the past i realize i behaved like a little girl so now im grossed out that men were attracted to me when i acted like a little girl does that mean they have pedophile tendencies also im really intimidated by dominating and masculine men but also attracted like i only can be around men who exhibit femininepassive energy right now and i get scared around dominating men who can make me submissive and thus controlled controlling my environment helps me feel in control and feel calmer due to my abuse history weird part is my abuser dad was actually passive and had submissive energy but was still abusive creepy and manipulated by playing the victim you would think i would be more scared around those types of men but i still find myself feeling safer around these kind of men over dominant because i can intimidate and scare them away by channeling masculine energy i am grossed out by men and dont trust themtoo many creeps out there who seem nice but then betray you if i had a daughter id be so protective its a scary world out there anyone relate,pre-pandemic

i started my education before i knew i was bipolar i really struggled for the first few years as id often start off the semester in a hypomanic state and finish it in a deep depression this was a cycle for about 45 years often accompanied by course withdrawals and a couple failures however a very observant md saw my cycles and referred me to the schools expert in bipolar disorder he diagnosed me in 20 minutes and started me on a regimen of medications the final year and a half went amazingly well so well in fact that i was able to finish all the courses i needed with good grades this morning i got word that im officially done edit thanks for the reward kind stranger,pre-pandemic

every conversation i have had about suicide in recent memory with mental health professionals or volunteers has included variations of the following have you considered listening to music have you considered going for a walk have you considered taking up a new hobby have you considered making new friends have you considered volunteeringgetting a job it happens every time it happens in every conversation it happened yesterday and it happened twenty minutes ago i finally summoned the courage to text a helpline for the first time because i just cant call one and this is the only help i received fuck yes fuck yes i have considered every possible option and opportunity to make me not imagine shooting a bullet in my skull or dragging a blade across my throat or tying a rope around my neck heres the problem it never works i have had meaningful employment and voluntary roles that i genuinely enjoyed i have socialised and met plenty of lovely people i have spent the last six years in a loving and nurturing relationship with a wonderful man i have taken long beautiful strolls in nature by the river i have fed the ducks and petted dogs and helped the elderly and looked after children i have listened to music and played the piano and sang my favourite songs the thing is i cant walk without imagining myself hurling my body in front of a car or drowning in the lake or lying on the train tracks i cant bake a cake from scratch without imagining myself plunging the kitchen knife into my wrists and bleeding out all over the counter i cant meet new people without withdrawing isolating myself and remembering that i am a burden i am a parasite i am worthless and i need to just die i cant trust anyone because i have been abused and broken and betrayed so profoundly that everyone feels like a potential threat the next predator i cant work or volunteer or commit to anything without my joints aching and my bones creaking without my mind spiralling and without my energy slipping away until i can barely move anymore i cant enjoy a hug with my boyfriend without imagining him choking the life out of me i cant do anything without wanting to die and picturing the multitude of ways i could end my life i could be having an amazing day and feel so much relief because wow for once i feel good the thoughts will linger in the background and watch they will creep a little closer and whisper in my ear and stand in front of me then climb inside my brain to remind me that they are still here that they will always be here no matter what i do to distract myself to find hope to find meaning im lost im lonely im alienated im tired it is so difficult to find people who understand because try not to kill yourself is not a part of everyones daily routine its not on everyones todo list i have considered everything i have tried everything and i still want to die every fucking day edit thank you all so much for your kindness and support it means so much i am working my way through the replies to this post and a previous post it might take time because i have a lot of messages but i will reach you all one by one thank you 3,pre-pandemic
not the usual crying for sex man its just that i find it funny xd yeah i know they have passed by far their useful life tbh im not really sure about why do i keep them my parents gave them to me at 19 which was kind of absurd cause i wasnt stupid enough to have sex without precautions and 19 seems like a little late but i got them i cant remember but i probably said that and made a sarcastic comment about how they would be there till i diedwhich now that i think about it almost happened like two years ago anyway im sure that if i die of old age with them in the wallet i will get a life trophy or something and maybe unlock a sandbox mode,pre-pandemic
when i sound fully competent and selfaware as i explain that i have borderline personality disorder it doesnt mean i do not have bpd i am not always in the middle of an episode when i explain how bad i can get during an episode i am not looking for sympathy and reassurance i am not putting myself down so that you will validate me i am trying to be honest about what is to come so that we can both be prepared we should probably set important boundaries before we start any sort of relationship i will not have trouble respecting boundaries if our relationship was built on them it is harder for me to respect boundaries established later in a relationship for that i am sorry if i go fully silent in the middle of an episode it is not because i am giving you the silent treatment i am dissociating and trying to prevent myself from escalating the situation and doing and saying something i will regret please give me some time to let my emotions return to normal and recognize i am not trying to punish you if i discuss suicide i am not doing it to make you feel guilty to me suicidal thoughts are such a significant part of my daily thought process that i genuinely forget that most people are alarmed by casual suicidal discussion if you let me know you are uncomfortable i will work hard to stop mentioning it around you i do not want to make you feel responsible for my thoughts and i will always remind you that it is not your fault my enthusiasm and passion are not fake just because a few people on the internet say that it is if we bond over something and i am excited my happiness is genuine we are sharing a real connection i am not just mirroring everything you do i have my own interests and hobbies that do not change just because some of my identity is in flux doesnt mean all of it is if i become interested in something you like that is because it is a normal part of forming bonds with others if i am having a breakdown that has nothing to do with you the best thing to do is to distract me from the negative emotions i just might not be able to ask for that in the moment because i am not thinking clearly which is why i need to change the emotions before doing anything else please do not make empty promises if you dont think you are capable of something do not tell me that you are i understand wanting to make me happy in that moment but i am absolutely crushed by empty promises cancelled plans etc i have to work hard to manage my expectations please do not promise me the world when you know you cant give it to me if you want to end the relationship please do so do not lie to me about how youre feeling and stay with me just because you dont want to hurt me do not cheat on me because youre afraid of dumping me that betrayal makes it worse i know it will be hard but if i am begging you not to break up with me block me refuse to engage it will hurt me so much that i will try to do anything to stop the pain but i ultimately recognize that it is bad for both of us if i do that and it is easier for me to say that now than in the middle of an episode my love for you is real i will not destroy your life i have empathy for you i care about you my brain is a little bit broken and i have to fight it sometimes its too broken and its too hard for you i understand if you need to leave just dont listen to people who tell you i do not have the capacity to love care and empathize i do,pre-pandemic
i almost did it yesterday i skipped school and went into the woods with some alcohol and a rope and i planned to end my life i tied the noose and i jumped from a tree miraculously my neck didnt break and and a homeless man came out of nowhere and cut me down in that second that i was hanging from the tree all i could think about was how much of a mistake it was i spent the rest of that day talking with the homeless man and learning about his experiences and i realized that life has its ups and downs but thats what life is you gotta live through the pain because its all experiences not good or bad experiences just experiences thank you mike if you are reading this,pre-pandemic

it took me 8 years to mention to the public that i struggle with addiction i should have done it sooner but i guess i just wasnt ready im writing this to let people know they are not alone i released my first album lonely traveler back in 2004 there is then a long gap between records music is my world i continued writing songs and performing shows to help spread the word in support of lonely traveler but soon lost my way i was in and out of behavioral health units and rehabs for 2 to 3 years i had my last drinkgod willing on november 16th 2010 im lucky to be alive i was diagnosed with depression and bipolar disorder while in the behavioral health unit ive had panic attacks and anxiety since i was 12 years old panic attacks that were so bad i ended up in the hospital when they first started i had no idea what was happening to me i thought i was dying or having a heart attack they were very scary over the years ive learned to deal with them much better they arent as frequent or severe from the outside looking in youd never know i had any mental health ailments i always greet people with a big smile and my dimples do a good job helping cover up my darker days that being said i think all humans are depressed from time to time some definitely more than others i also feel addiction and depressionanxiety are cut from the same cloth i used alcohol to self medicate for years it worked for a long time to help with the pain until it didnt work anymore the wheels eventually fell off the bus and the train derailed from the tracks i write this to let those out there that are still suffering know that there is hope there is also nothing to be ashamed of admitting that you are sad or depressed or have an addiction problem is hard i can promise you though that once you face your demons and accept them youll feel relief when you do ask for help youll immediately feel relief once you surrender you start winning there is definitely still a stigma in regards to mental illness in general mental illness isnt treated the same as other ailments people feel sorry for those with cancer but not people with addiction problems i think the general public has come around more in the last few years but there is still a long way to go also there are some that truly understand that addiction is a disease the stigma isnt categorical among all people being a guy people commonly say ah get over it toughen up you shouldnt let this or that affect you you have nothing to be depressed about guess what depression anxiety and addiction doesnt need a reason furthermore showing your emotions is a sign of strength and not a weakness it takes more strength to show your emotions and feelings than to hide them in addition men have been taught to hide their feelings and remain stoic they dont want to appear weak or less than sometimes ill wake up sad for no reason honestly my life is absolutely wonderful and i have so much to be grateful for i literally have zero reasons to feel sad or depressed however there are some days where my head feels heavy like a thick gray cloud my thinking is muddled and the world feels like its caving in on me i cant explain it some days are just like that i tell myself that this too shall pass and it always does when im in that fog though it feels like the world is ending it is hard to function i then get mad at myself for not having the energy to be productive in these tough moments i need to remind myself that its okay i take paxil to help with anxiety and depression there is nothing wrong with taking medication to help you feel normal it doesnt make you weak ive also used meditation as another way to calm my mind another key ingredient to keeping myself in tip top mental shape is exercise exercise is the number one thing i can do in my life to help keep me healthy in general it really is that simple theres a trickle down effect exercise releases the happy endorphins such as dopamine in the brain i also use a lot of positive self talk to keep me in good spirits the mind is very powerful and will believe everything you tell it if youre feeling down or struggling with addiction nobody is going to shame you and those that do arent worth knowing the people that care about you most will support you they will respect you and they will be happy to see you happy if youre feeling low please call a friend or family member to chat friends and family have saved me many times over the years there is no shame in admitting you need help were all human and we all need help sometimes brett,pre-pandemic

the thought of suicide always gives me relief whenever i feel like everything is going wrong i could easily get rid of myself and i would no longer have to participate in this shit existence i cant imagine actually growing old i dont understand how others can magically plan out their lives while actually having real goals for themselves and not once think about harming or killing themselves its so foreign to me,pre-pandemic
does anyone else feel embarrassed and guilty for the social media presence they portrayed while in a manic state guys i could just break down and cry right now but i know that wont change the past i was going through my old posts on social media and screenshots of convos on my google drive god i was so cringe the things i would say posts i would share the rants i would go off on oh god those damn rants most is from last winter when i was reeeaaaaally bad i never even noticed i was manic until it was to late and got hospitalized in april so from december to april i was running around like a maniac its so odd the way it can make someone have a completley different personality sharing sexually charged quotes posting fucked up song lyrics flirting with everyone the worst is the revealing photos i had posted at one point i had family om my friends lists now with a clear mind i would never do any of these things thats just not me and the old conversations i had back while manici could puke i am so embarrased i would give way to much detail about very personal things i was easy to go off with anger i acted like i was a literal queen and above every single person around me the part that i hate the most is that no one realizes how sick i have been the past few years they all just think im some asshole bitch thats complete trash on social media i have deleted facebook a few months ago and so far it seems to help but the constant embarresment and anxiety from my past eats at me,pre-pandemic
thanks mom for making this coment every time you wanted me to do things your way without actually teaching me how to be good and now two decades later i alter between doing whatever it takes to make people love me like not saying no impulsive sex doing drugs and isolating because i hate myself and know that everything inside me is rotten and theres just no way out for me because i do behave like this and thats the reason why nobody loves me so i might as well just avoid people altogether,pre-pandemic

sorry for the wordy title i dont know how else to put it i keep on going through this cycle usually after having a good couple of days ill suddenly become really positive and motivated to throw myself into recovery and make my life as good as i possibly can i make mental plans about trying even harder in therapy improving my eating habits getting a good sleeping pattern exercising more saving money investing time in my hobbies getting organised going back to work with a perfect attendance record having perfect relationships with people and not wasting a single second of my days at the time it feels like its all possible and ive cracked the code to being mentally healthy im ready to put 100 effort into it all and then a few days later or however long it takes my mindset completely changes suddenly i just dont care about any of that stuff and achieving even a single one of the goals i thought about seems impossible the motivation turns to nothing and i feel like im never going to change even if i try to do so i almost laugh at my past self for being so hopeful because it feels ridiculous now id rather just waste my time away until it runs out rinse and repeat dae,pre-pandemic

i get having a favourite person disassociation abandonment issues no sense of identityetc but in some ways its so much more than just the nine or so symptoms in the dsm thats almost too simple someone just reading the dsm could never understanding exactly how far reaching and invasive this disorder actually is i think my friends think im a bit lost and emotionally a bit manic they think im a little highly strung or simply hyper they think my existence is like the stereotypical manic pixie dream girl a little troubled but interesting the extent of the mess is hidden and i dont know if i want them to know more they dont know about so many things how i had a meltdown the other night because i couldnt braid my hair right at 1230am in the morning cried and wanted to throw things like a child the way i get so pent up on one emotion and too obsessed overthinking to the point where i bite myself or grab the nearest sharp object to simply release some of this energy the paranoia how actually genuinely crazy i am thinking everyone hates me is talking about me and then the extreme like thinking cameras are in my room how suspicious i am of them and how my opinion of them constantly changes how i can love them so much one minute then resent their existence the next how everything takes so much effort how even focussing on one task takes so much energy because my head never shuts the fuck up to what extent i cant enjoy basic socialising because i disassociate and have to go to the toilet to ground myself how shaky my identity is to the point that changing my clothes makes me feel like a different person how can you know me if i dont how nowhere feels like home nowhere can be yours if you are no one how i want to rage and scream and cry and then laugh and shout with joy and how quickly i flick how every piece of affirmation and compliment defines my short term personality and makes my day but also how every slight perceived rejection makes me spiral and hate myself how hard everyday activities are because if they dont go right again i switch and spiral i feel so much joy but also so much sadness so much of my energy is used just keeping the base of my life intact but add any strains and it cracks then all of a sudden im crying in my kitchen accusing my best friend of hating me sometimes i want to die because i cannot cope sometimes i love life because its amazing but most of the time im just exhausted from all of this i know it can get better and im seeing a therapist and doing dbt i eat well and exercise and put all my energy into keeping the axes of my life stable all of that leaves me drained and then i fall into bed and i cannot fucking sleep edit i posted this as a rant i wrote during a lecture and never expected so many comments i will try and reply to all of them tomorrow but i appreciate all of them thank you,pre-pandemic
i have made an important realization id like to share because maybe itll resonate with others to preface this i am one of the worst hypochondriacs youll ever meet i obsess about all sorts of nasty illnesses that i am extremely unlikely to ever experience i have wasted hundreds of hours on medical papers websites and many dollars on unnecessary medical expenses the truth is that my obsession with illness is a symptom of a deeper existential crisis i dont see any meaning in life other than actually being alive therefore being alive and avoiding serious lifethreatening illness is the highest possible goal within my frame of personal meaning by preoccupying myself with health and with ill health i feel that obsessing about these things is my only purpose because it achieves a continuation of living but that achievement is to the detriment of actually enjoying my existence and immersing in it fully i am not sure what this means in terms of actually overcoming this horrible affliction if my only value system is simply to be alive and to survive everything else that could provide meaning becomes unimportant,pre-pandemic

people with posttraumatic stress disorder ptsd tend to have elevated levels of a biomarker called glucocorticoid receptorfkbp51 protein complex fearconditioned mice also have higher levels of the grfkbp51 protein complex a new study of mice with ptsdlike symptoms suggests that using another peptide tatgrpep to disrupt the grfkbp51 protein complex blocks the encoding and recall of fearbased memories and prevents fight flight or freeze responses at this stage studies on targeting the grfkbp51 complex to treat or prevent ptsd are still in their early infancy much more research is needed to know if peptides that stop fight flight or freeze behaviors in fearconditioned mice work the same way in humans who have experienced severe trauma psychologytodaycom,pre-pandemic

im on mobile so cant link to my other post but youll see my initial post about this a few months ago in my history to sum up about 78 months ago i began getting dizzy spells out of the blue vertigo and then a constant feeling of swayingoff balance i flipped out my ha was through the roof i saw three doctors who diagnosed me with some inner ear problem and assured me it would go away eventually i didnt believe them though and was convinced i had a brain tumour or ms or something the anxiety destroyed me i couldnt sleep eat enjoy life i was suicidal at one point because i just felt panicky all the time and couldnt stand the feeling of being off balance sometimes there were triggers for it sometimes it just happened it was every day though and caused me so much stress after 3 months i got an mri bloodwork and ct scan i was terrified but glad i got them they all came back normal it was such a relief i went to see a vestibular physiotherapist who performed some tests and agreed with the doctors that it was an inner ear issue he thinks bppv he told me that everyone heals at a different rate and to do exercises to help retrain my brain to not get dizzy so easily its been around 78 months since this started and things are a lot better its not gone but the exercises helped a lot and i no longer fear the dizzy sensation all the time if i had just trusted my doctors in the first place with their initial diagnosis i couldve saved myself so much grief and pain im going to do my best from now on to listen to what they say and stay off google i have successfully avoided this even though ive had other small health scares pop up ive learned that the less i talk about it ideally not at all and with no googlebody scanning that the anxiety comes and goes quickly anyways just wanted to post this for anyone else who may have similar symptoms all was normal with me and it very likely is for you too obviously check with a doctor if youre unsure but if they tell you youre fine then you are oh and the anxiety absolutely made my symptoms way worse it would sometimes happen on its own but once i stopped obsessing over it all the time it was far more mild and less frequent,pre-pandemic

i learnt something tragic yesterday one of my female acquaintances recently lost her older sister to suicide yesterday she was talking about it and it turns out her sister was incredibly lonely the part that really hit me was when my acquaintance said she just wanted to be loved she had a lot of friends and was wellliked by everybody that knew her but romanticallyemotionally she was lonely this is why it also makes me angry when people say relationships are not as great as you think it is abundantly clear that people need deep meaningful connections with other humans if youve never been lonely for a long period of time you have no idea how that hurts you how it breaks you down how it leaves a gaping hole stay strong my fellow lonely hearts i hope each one of you find that something that person that connection you are looking for,pre-pandemic

im not autistic but my very young son is he doesnt seem the better for it at least not right now i joined this subreddit as a potential source of learning more i am surprised to see so much background talk about accepting the condition for what it is i dont understand this maybe im not understanding what people are saying we have to accept things we cannot change but that doesnt mean we should mischaracterize reality and autism still seems like damage not just difference am i getting that wrong why do people think so we all have damage in some way maybe youre diabetic have depression are missing a limb or are below average intelligence in some area but that doesnt mean we dont excel elsewhere and it doesnt mean we dont have dignity or are deserving of respect i dont see any of those beliefs as inconsistent with recognizing autism as requiring some remedying,pre-pandemic
it really plants a deep seed of anger and irritation in my heart when i hear those words i also hate being told that i have to be strong even though i know its relatively decent advice no shit i have to be strong otherwise i wouldnt even be here right now someone said to me that they went through a comparable minor incident breakup of a 2 year relationship and got through it by praying to god saying it liberated him and made him feel so content with life and while yes he is valid to feel upset about it i dont think its appropriate to bring that up to compare to my bus crash and my mental recovery with it they and their family also went on to tell me that my medication was all gateway bullshit that i need to get off of and being the passive dipshit i am i agreed with them and went along with all of it not to mention when i told them i have ptsd they went on to ask about my symptoms and even asked oh what are your visions what are your nightmares what do you see at night and a ton of followup questions that forced me to go into detail that i didnt want to again im passive as hell so its not easy to say no to anyone but i just wish people were more considerate and understanding its not like im asking them to never talk about vehicle accidents or to never make any quick movements so why is it so hard to be decent and accommodate my basic needs im sure people who dont have ptsd at least know not to fucking ask about their flashbacks in detail,pre-pandemic

i was so nervous all last night and all day today about this interview interviews are a major trigger for me i almost always have an anxiety attack in the middle of them and im really not very good at them on top of that it was for a bilingual role and i knew id have to speak german and i was so insecure about my fluency and so freaking anxious that i would totally bomb and embarrass myself i was so close to canceling i made a million excuses to my friends in family about why i didnt really want the job anyway so i might as well not go i am so so glad i didnt i experienced a bit of anxiety but no attacks i wasnt stammering and awkward like i usually am and i was really confident in all of my answers best of all when they brought in the german dude so i could converse with him he said it was really good and my pronunciation was great and after he left they all said hes never been impressed by anyones german before i never feel good or confident after leaving an interview but this time i do i really really really hope i get the job the office is unreal benefits are wild free breakfast and lunch everyone was super laid back better pay but even if i dont im just so damn proud of myself for forcing myself to go instead of bailing like i always do just had to share because i feel super happy right now wish me luck edit thank you thank you thank you everyone for the kind words its so awesome to be able to share this excitement with so many people i will update once i hear back about the job,pre-pandemic

im no expert and i know everyone is different but ive come a long way with my health anxiety and wanted to share a little of what i learned on mobile excuse format and typos i once read something along the lines of our brain believes everything we tell it so if we start filling it with doubt and anxiety we create a world that is simply not true a year ago and i was telling myself every little symptom meant imminent death i worried about brain cancer breast cancer blood cloths etc etc etc im still in the process of completely desensitize myself from the most minimal sensations and im still trying to learn how to really understand what my body is trying to tell me this is kind of how i learned to deal with it again i know not everyone is the same but hopefully this will be useful for someone 1 if i can distract myself from the sensation or discomfort then its anxiety i call them sensations because any little thing i feel i wanna convince myself is pain even if its not i try to ignore it if thats the case my doctor always told me small sensations or symptoms are not a sign of anything serious 2 if its interrupting your day to day then take something for your symptom and try to move on eg you have a sore throat then get something specifically for that 3 if over the counter meds dont do it and its well over a week or so then ill call my doctor explain whats going on and see if i can come in for some answers and peace of mind if you have multiple terrible symptoms then of course go check with your doctor asap but the main thing is breathe friend dont freak out immediately dont google about it try to accept the thought and the sensations as exactly that thoughts and sensations and nothing more theyre not a sign of anything you wont heal your mind in a day but in time things will get better ironically life is not guaranteed for anybody no matter what but looking for symptoms constantly means youre wasting something you want to hold on to so desperately think about that i do it everyday,pre-pandemic

for the past couple years my health anxiety was terrible i would constantly think about my heart and other random shit about my body wondering if i was gonna die it affected me everyday and there were many times when i was out doing something i had to physically leave because i was so anxious about my health since about a month ago my health anxiety is nonexistent i beat it and it feels amazing to have my life back i recently found this sub and i empathize so much with the people here because i experienced the same things i know how much it sucks hopefully this posts helps some people preface im getting a lot of this information out of napoleon hills think and grow rich he talks about what he calls the fear of ill health and his knowledge of the subject cured all my anxiety im gonna summarize whats said in the book the mind as im sure most of you know health anxiety is all created in the mind this means that the mind is the only thing that can cure health anxiety also understand your mind is extremely powerful and completely connected to your body in ways we cant explain your health anxiety has nothing to do with your body and everything to do with your mind your mind and thoughts can affect your body in almost any way you let it this is why health anxiety causes panic attacks and can even make you feel symptoms of the condition youre anxious about luckily we can control our mind and thoughts therefore we can control and eliminate health anxiety the fear of ill health the fear of ill health is traced to physical and social heredity its closely tied to the fear of death which ill touch on because it leads us into places we dont know but imagine to be terrible in main we fear ill health due to the terrible pictures that have been put into our minds if death should overtake us this is the root cause of your health anxiety hypochondria is the habit of thinking about an illness concentrating the mind upon the disease and expecting its appearance until a nervous condition appears this is what your health anxiety is its all created in your thoughts and mind the mind is very powerful it either builds or destroys us do not let your thoughts destroy you in the form of health anxiety the fear of death fearing death is pointless death is inevitable for everyone you must accept death as a necessity and pass it out your mind it must be necessary or it would not come at all and if it is necessary which it is perhaps it is not as bad as you may think the entire world is made of two things matter and energy from elementary school we learn that neither matter nor energy the only two realities known can ever be created or destroyed both matter and energy can be transformed but never destroyed life if anything is energy if neither matter nor energy can be destroyed then life can never truly be destroyed life like many other forms of energy may passed through phases of transition and change but never truly destroyed death is a mere transition even if death is not a mere change at its worst it will be a long and peaceful sleep and sleep is nothing to be feared thus we can wipe out the fear of death forever how to get over your worry relieve yourself of the fear of death by accepting that death is an inescapable event accepting this is a big step to beating health anxiety eliminate the fear of ill health by ignoring your symptoms whenever you think you have a symptom just think to yourself i ignore my symptoms no matter what it is think i ignore my symptoms x200b understanding the above information and thinking i ignore my symptoms whenever something comes up has given me my life back i hope this helps someone,pre-pandemic

update my daughter will be celebrating 2 years of sobriety on sept 13th which happens to also be my birthday 3 years after i wrote the below she lives with me and constantly working on herself keep the hope letter to my daughters addiction you came into our lives about 10 years ago although i never knew it then it took probably 2 years before we realized you had a hold onto this beautiful child of mine my first born my world the breathtakingly beautiful girl who made me move mountains and who drove my resolve because there was nothing equally as important in my life than her and her sister i despise you i hate that because of you savannah checked into rehab 4 times never completing and overdosed 3 times almost dying every single time one of these times was when she was driving the car she stole from me to go get high she hit 2 parked vehicles while she slumped behind the wheel unconscious only to be revived by the paramedics and narcan i despise the fact that your uphold is so strong that even when she is hospitalized because of her needle use for an infectious cyst next to her spine not other than mersa she still chooses to put you first and checks herself out twice amo to get high while i stand there helplessly watching her compromise her health her life i hate that she puts you first not because you make her feel good anymore but because without you she feels deathly sick every time she attempts to beat you i hate that the best way to indirectly have a remote shot of beating you is for me to cut any ties with one of the 2 human beings i love the most in the world because the tragedy you bring into her life makes me a powerless enabler at best i despise you for making the purest love on earth a parent love a detrimental weapon to her potential recovery i despise you for making me stop to breathe every time a strange phone number with the same area code as where she chooses to reside shows up on my phone making me think it is another hospital with perhaps the worst news of all i hate that you render me powerless and incapable of saving the one person i love the most in the world and that counter nature to every fiber of my motherly being i have to divorce myself from her life of turpitudes and disasters because that is what the addiction experts and counselors advised us to do this is the saddest club in the world we belong to all of us parents and loved ones of addicts our love never falters and we must carry this silent burden with courage if you are like me feeling the weight of the unavoidable absence of your addict loved one during the holidays i want to send tons of good vibes your way hoping for a clean future one day at a time valerie,pre-pandemic

one of my 20f guy friends was having a hard time today the dude is like 62 incredibly handsome works out studies engineering amazing teeth and energy but still struggles with self esteem bad anyways im always blown away when he says something about feeling ugly because i tell no jokes when i say this man is a solid 9510 by universal standards i was listing off all the attractive qualities about him in an attempt to make him feel better like that ever works with anybody and he finally breaks tells me he grew up really chubby and got thin in the beginning by severely restricting food even after losing the weight and seeing how people treated him differently he couldnt shake the vision of himself he formed as a kid fat ugly unloveable if anything glowing up made him more insecure i understood exactly what he meant i grew up with cystic acne chubby awkward i had no friends nobody took me seriously nobody saw me cue my junior year of high school an eating disorder platinum dyed hair and accutane and suddenly the world is full of generosity kindness respect and attention i saw the stereotypical mold of beauty and shoved myself into it no matter the cost on my physical and mental health and it proved 100 of my fears about people treating me badly because i was ugly my friend and i both agreed that glowing up didnt make us any more confident in fact it made us more paranoid and kinda justified our bad ed behavior we know what its like to be ugly and we know how much better life treats you when youre thin and pretty well do anything not to go back and were constantly terrified that we somehow transformed back into what we once thought we were without realizing it that were fat again we know it happened once and know that it could happen again both of us know that in reality our version of fat is probably closer to healthy and dont judge anyone else but ourselves based on these impossible standards can anyone else relate edit typo and thanks for the gold friend 3 edit 2 wow thank you all so much for sharing your stories and being so supportive my friend and i have been reading through all the comments as they come and we both agree thats its been so awesome and validating to see how many of us went through similar situations this community is amazing,pre-pandemic

i read and responded to a post on this topic yesterday and op from that post recommended that i make my comment a post of its own after all the times ive been helped by this community this finally feels like my opportunity to give back here goes cracks knuckles x200b so ive been struggling with this lately myself ive been wanting to learn the guitar for literally years but never had the money to buy one now that i have the money to do it i keep getting cold feet and thinking oh man i know im not gonna be able to stick with it so its not even worth buying but fck it im gonna buy it heres how i came to that decision x200b 1 be kind to yourself obviously 1 universal rule of adhd applicable to all scenarios selfloathing sucks do your best to be kind to yourself i recently came across the term selfcompassion which i really like be at least as nice to yourself as youd be to other people you wouldnt make fun ofbeat up a loved one who switches hobbies often so dont do it to yourself x200b 2 emphasize dynamic hobbies someone in yesterdays thread used the phrase dynamic hobbies and i think thats a god damn genius phrase we need hobbies that we can pick up for a month or two at a time and completely forget for another few months thats just how myour hobbies work we just need to accept that and choose compatible hobbies last month i got obsessed with freshwater aquariums watched a ton of youtube videos went to petco to scout potential fish etc even bought a fancy ass 100 fish tank from amazon then i realized that this is not a dynamic hobby forgettingnot caring about my aquarium for months will result in dead fish error 404 incompatible hobby fish tank was subsequently returned relatedly i had a plant in my bedroom that i needed to water every day or few days that plant is dead as hell i now have one of those plants that you only need to remember to water once a month snake plant if youre wondering plant is thriving lol as far as hobbies go guitar is super dynamic if i learn 3 songs this month and no songs for the next two months no one dies x200b 3 reset your expectations listen i know myself i am not about to practice diligently every day for the next year and be performing at local bars in 2 years thatd be great but its a pipe dream if i define that as the goal im going to fall short and feel shitty instead im going to focus on being able to strum a couple songs here and there when im bored and maybe learn one song for my girlfriend that i can use to score some romantic brownie points on a birthdayanniversary thats it anything else is icing on the cake if i do actually end up learning guitar for real awesome if i dont awesome the point here is to add something to my life that brings me joy and dammit strumming along to a song with 4 basic chords from time to time gives me joy dont squeeze all the joy out of it by putting too many expectations on it or on yourself x200b 4 reduce the barriers to exit specifically financially youve heard of barriers to entry well allow me to introduce you to a new concept barriers to exit super important recognize and accept that your new hobby crush may fade with time when i get excited about a new hobby i am super tempted to buy professionalgrade stuff mistake when entering a new hobby recognize that it may not last and make it as easy as possible to get out of financially meaning it wont be too much of a loss if when you give it up when starting a new hobby that requires purchasing things try to force yourself to only purchase entry level stuff until the hobby has stuck around for long enough to justify investing in or buy things that can easily be resold on the internet entry level dslr camera that can be resold if you decide you hate photography fine professional grade dlsr camera engraved with your first and last name and therefore with limited resale value not fine not fine at all this month i started a new workout class went to the first class and loved it was ready to purchase the 200 month unlimited monthly membership for 12 months yay then a little voice said hey man remember to reduce the barriers to exit you might not like this next month so instead i bought the 50 entrylevel package and will reevaluate my commitment as i go if it doesnt stick it wont nearly be as much of a loss x200b 5 dont try harder try differently also a foundational adhd rule but relevant in literally every scenarioincluding this one when it comes to a new hobby you may need to outsource your executive function to a teacher or class if you can afford it example ive had a regular gym membership for 6 months and literally only gone 1 single time its just too much to actually figure out what workouts i am supposed to be doing keep myself accountable to the time set for each exercise etc also tbh its honestly kind of boring i signed up for a workout class last week the only thing i need to do is show up they already have the exercises planned so i dont need to think about it and its a group class so theres constant motivation to push myself from peers i have exercised 5 times in the last 7 days thats like an infinity percent improvement from my previous strategy i would never have gotten there if i was just trying harder at a strategy that didnt work for me x200b 6 trying new hobbies is a hobby unto itself what is the definition of a hobby something you do for fun some people collect stamps for fun other people watch birds for fun others make scrapbooks you know what i do try new hobbies i get pleasure from getting excited about a random thing and diving into it a month at a time trying new hobbies is my hobby no sense in feeling guilt or shame about it when it makes me so god damn happy this is a subtle but really important reframing person x would say i collect stamps for fun last year i found a rare limited edition 1956 stamp from montana and a couple from california in the 1760s i loved it i would say i try new hobbies for fun last year i dabbled in photography guitar and dog sitting i loved it both of us would be having fun doing what we do person x would never feel bad about him or herself for not trying enough new things so why would i ever feel bad about trying too many new things x200b tldr be kind to yourself accept that your hobbies will have to be dynamic instead of trying harder consider trying differently reduce the financial barriers to exit and most importantly recognize that trying new hobbies is a hobby godspeed mateys happy hobbying edit1 several of you have appreciated the dynamic hobbies concept so i went back to track down exactly where i first heard it credit goes to ucarlulua d edit2 holy smokes silver and gold deep gratitude to all of you like i said above my greatest reward is feeling like ive given back to people whove given me so much 3 edit3 platinum1 i didnt even know that existed jokes aside to everyone thats expressed their thanks i want to thank you i spend some part of literally every single day hating how my brain works or doesnt and wondering whether ill ever have anything of value to offer the world today you all helped me feel like something i did was meaningful and that means more than i can say eternal love to you all,pre-pandemic

shes right here in the bed next to me her liver doesnt liv anymore and her kidneys have closed up shop her blood pressure has dropped to the point where the meds are the only thing keeping her alive tomorrow we find out if the transplant committee is willing to overlook her drinking and take the chance that she might change if they say no shes never going to wake up the doctors will try to make her comfortable until she dies if they say yes and they find a donor in time and she survives the transplant and gets through recovery and manages to stay sober she can live a good life none of those ifs feel particularly likely at the moment my little sister is 34 we didnt have a great childhood our parents drank a lot and left us to our own devices more often than not we both developed maladaptive coping mechanisms i binge ate and sunk unhealthily deep into fictional and video games to the occlusion of all other aspects of my life she drank and worked then drank while working and worked while drinking i never drank much eventually i got my life together lost a bunch of weight went to school met my wife bought a house had kids ect i dont understand why i took this path and hers was so different my parents bought a bar and hired her to run it she was good at it she turned the business into a huge success and she drank her husband was an exploitative abusive immature jackass he drank a lot to and they drank together i thought when she divorced him last fall maybe things were turning around she just drank more i am irrationally angry with her with our parents and with her ex husband all the people who were close to her and watched this happen when they werent encouraging it im angry with myself for getting so wrapped up in my own family that i wasnt there for her she could have stopped she could have taken the path of healing that i found so ralcoholism here i am i needed to vent i appreciate that you exist update 1011 the transplant committee said no shes too sick to survive the transplant and hasnt shown the kind of sobriety that they need to see to feel comfortable giving her a liver update 1012 were taking her off life support today,pre-pandemic

here is what you need to know headaches are rarely a sign of anything serious if you got up this morning without having any of the following you are completely fine a seizure vomiting having pain that feels like an axe was embedded inside your head dizziness trouble walking forgetting your name or having trouble reading something up close do also note that these things can be caused by many other causes as well cancer in young people is extremely rare and so are neurological problems the reason why is because your immune system is much stronger when youre younger young people who have cancer are almost always going to live longer than five years dying due to cancer is almost unheard of under the age of 50 cancers and other major problems are always noticeable and grow rapidly in young people ct and mri scans are almost always useless if you are healthy many of the symptoms of brain cancer are not caused by any underlying problems these symptoms include temporary loss of balance twitching muscle jerks brain fog messing upmisspelling a word forgetting something and headaches trust me these symptoms are more common than you think so in conclusion brain cancers and every other cancer should be the least of your worries especially if you are young and healthy i am not reassuring that you dont have it i am however showing you that worrying about something that almost never happens is a waste of time anxiety can waste minutes hours days months or even years of your life now i know this probably isnt going to stop you from worrying about your symptoms but the more you try to seek out reassurance from both reddit and the internet the more youre going to panic what you need to do is find a way to break your vicious ha circle and break it now before it gets worse,pre-pandemic
79 hours ago i had finished the last of my mickey after 66 hours without a drink i caved and bought some vodka drank it and got caught by my husband being drunk we had a big conversation about my drinking and just how much support im going to need to get through this we decided he would be in control of my finances from now on not having access to my bank account has made things a lot easier i feel way less tempted to try and drink these last three days have actually flown by last time those 66 hours were agony im feeling hopeful tonight were playing dnd this will be the first time ill be playing without alcohol im a little nervous but overall mostly excited to play our campaign and have a fun night with some good people,pre-pandemic
i have always been so baffled by my own life because i have been through a lot of extremely negative experiences outside of my control and powered through them but i am absolutely awful at coping with minor inconveniences if a friend has to cancel on me or does something that lets me down i feel sad and disappointed and it spirals out of control its taken me a long time to realize that the reason that its so hard for me to deal with these moments is that i am aware that i shouldnt be reacting to them in such an extreme way i obviously recognize that shit just happens and the world isnt out to get me people will always disappoint me in some way and its not always their fault if people do something that disappoints me but i feel strong emotions all of the time and i cant just turn them off so when i feel strong emotions in response to something minor i am so ashamed and angry at myself for feeling those strong emotions that it spirals out of control when really bad things happen to me i feel like my emotions are valid and that allows me to work through the situation without breaking down this is why it is so important to remind ourselves that emotions themselves are valid yes we feel very extreme emotions in situations when other people might not feel those emotions but that doesnt mean that theres something fundamentally wrong with us it just is what it is,pre-pandemic

i noticed that one thing that i dont do nearly enough in this sub is relate to actually absorb the thoughts of the people who post and comment i think that irl other parts of the internet and even other parts of reddit i get so caught up in managing the symptoms and pitfalls of my whirlwind clusterfuck in the moment brain that i can just come here to dump sometimes it just feels like ill be able to get through the week better if i just shamelessly announce yes i have that too probably worse i dont know how i deal but after getting some thoughtful replies to comments this weekfrom people who like me sometimes just glance off the intended point of the conversation who like me go in some random direction right at the end so close to finishing a thought the way they intended thats when i had to admit that i wasnt serving myself best by just simply venting after the blackout to protest the awful freedom sucking regulation called sopatheotherone this has become one the most thoughtfully moderated subs that i am proud to point people to on reddit replete with a truly broad set of people from the notquiteableto escape the oppression which is public high school to those successfully pursuing post graduate degrees the mature to the relatively young those strong enough pick up others who are down to those so immobilized with anxiety that they cannot anticipate how they are going to get their next meal there girls and guys hyperactive and inattentive the hilariously irreverent and the strangely morbid vetarans and undiagnosedbutsearching as well as genuinely interested parents and boyfriends and girlfriends anyway i hope to be able to get a better feel for some of you because in some ways a help group can be better than any one perfect book or analogy or video though if you get the opportunity try to get through the 30 min barkley video in the faq 1 3 tgg,pre-pandemic

i will try and keep this short i 30yof f hate christmas with a passion when i was 12yo my alcoholic mother and step dad arrived home with my 4yo brother at 1am on christmas day i put him to bed and they were so drunk the inevitable fight broke out i was in the living room wrapping my brothers presents because they hadnt bothered 3 times i went into the kitchen to tell them to stop the 4th time i walked in just before she picked up the knife and stabbed him punched his lung i screamed and she followed me out of the room a few mins later he was calling her back in our massive kitchen was covered in blood and she rushed him to the hospital i didnt want my brother to wake up and see it so i cleaned it up i was covered in blood i hid the clothes showered and waited she came home and spent the next few hours telling me i would have to raise my brother because she was going to jail for murder they lied to the police and made me lie to everyone in the family i found out years later that they were aloud to tell people about it but me being a stupid kid never did i have other mental health issues and this time of year brings it all back the nightmares start in september when the christmas crap starts appearing i wish i could hide from the whole season i dont know why im venting hear i just feel like shit this year i was diagnosed with bpd bi polar and ptsd christmas in that house is going to be horrible,pre-pandemic
let me get this straight i have what i would call a pretty mild form of health anxiety i went to my yearly checkup about a week ago and let my doctor know all of my bodily concerns sure i should stop eating so much crap and exercise more but turns out im healthy in most every way i got to thinking i dont give my body nearly enough credit bodies are amazingly capable of adapting and fighting disease and pushing the limits they go right much more often than they go wrong seriously i know what some of you battle is much more severe than what i deal with but i hope youll remember that as long as you take care of your body your body for the most part will take care of you heres to giving our amazing bodies the credit they deserve,pre-pandemic
it took me by surprise there i was going along strong making strides in therapy doing good me work occupying good head space with little negative self talk and then wham fucker took residence in my mind and rode me all week i was so low and so depressed that i thought my struggle didnt matter that nothing mattered but i won i get to enter week 17 clean the hardest part was the draw to use from a stronger foothold then the usual wanting to use under stress or duress but i flipped the script in my head from nothing matters as a non believer who would shrug and say who cares x of years from now the sun is going to wipe everything out anywayto no it all matters so much it was a very surreal moment in my recovery,pre-pandemic
i have a problem of anytime someone tells me i did something right or good theyre either lying to intentionally validatedecieve me or misinformed and dont actually know enough to give me a valid appraisal alternatively even if the person is a total moron who intentionally insults people for a reaction if they say anything negative to me it has to be true and make me stew in it for ages anyone else feel like this,pre-pandemic

to give some context the event happened on may 20 2018 we had just moved into a nice apartment after living in extended stays for the past couple of years i got my own bedroom and the complex had a small pool i could swim at during the summer which was really exciting for me since i was so used to sleeping on air mattresses it was around 1000am my mom went to pick up a dog that my dad was supposedly going to give me as a gift me and my stepdad expected the trade would take only a few minutes as they were meeting at a gas station across the street from the complex building an hour later she didnt show up my stepdad tried to call her over and over again but she wouldnt pick up i didnt worry that much as i thought that the trade was taking longer than expected a little later we hear a knock on our door it was the police who told us that my dad shot my mom than shot himself everyone was in absolute shock when they heard the news they were crying and screaming with grief while i just stood there trying to comfort anyone i could it didnt set in with me that this was actually happening a lot happened during that year im leaving out a lot of details but i ended up being put in a mental ward for a week after threatening to commit suicide after the event i bottled up so much emotions that it got to the point where i just snapped in that instance i wanted to kill myself i wanted to kill other people i wanted everything to just stop existing for as long as i wanted it to needless to say i didnt feel so good for the next few months i still struggle with the grief but i try to manage it as best i can its the middle of the night as im writing this it keeps on playing in the back of my mind so i cant fall asleep i felt like i needed to get this out there so i would stop destroying myself over something that wasnt my fault i was 14 when it happened im 15 now i cant see myself the way my peers do anymore i feel like my childhood was taken away from me tldr the murder suicide fucked me up big time and im trying to get over it the best i can sorry for the long post i just felt like i needed to get this out there,pre-pandemic
like what if your partner ran into this someone and they just instantly had amazing chemistry and its love at first sight type of deal and that person felt like their true soulmate what if they run into this person and they experienced a more intense more emotional feeling with them than they ever did with you im deathly scared of this more than anything else being someone mentally ill makes me feel like anyone who is normal and healthy would just be a better more deserving partner than me,pre-pandemic

one year ago i was up well past midnight on adderall smoking weed and crying because my wife was not coming home it suddenly hit me that it was time to make a radical change in my life at 7 oclock in the morning i reached out to my family and told them that i was struggling with substance abuse i had been smoking weed daily for over 20 years and at various times had used opiates benzos amphetamines and xtc i went to an iop class and then to an mrt class all the while going to weekly therapy sessions in spite of my positive transformation my wife did not come back but i did get custody of our children when the divorce was finalized there are times when i think about using and let me tell you ive had plenty of opportunities the bottom line is i like who i am without the drugs i miss my wife and the relationship that we once had but perhaps i needed to lose her in order to find myself so my story is a little bittersweet and that is life i am still learning to accept the things i cannot change,pre-pandemic

i tried to kill myself i overdosed heavily on a cocktail of pills and medicines the advice i have dont nobody talks about the aftermath of when somebody saves your life the people who know you are torn apart by grief even though you survived and you get to see it and you also get to see everybody talk to you as if on eggshells treat you like youre a kicked puppy and the guilt is worse than that before because you caused that and they wont admit it to you the guilt is soul destroying and then theres you your stomach cant handle anything but water and plain bread the sharp stabbing pains and rises of nausea that knock you off your feet the shaking for no reason entire body failing to function correctly at any given moment sleep no you will wake up routinely every hour or so and thats if you can fall asleep after fighting your guilt over trying and the physical pain its caused on top of what made you try in the first place oh and when you finally think your body has recovered its worse you cant go out without being drained and you have literally liquid shit like youre peeing out of your ass water can even make you feel sick okay sure you wanna die but a lot dont succeed and the failure is grim i have liver damage my stomach linings are non existent im suffering more than before and i could never try again because of who i affected and the damage ive done edit its been 3 weeks i have to take medication for my stomach otherwise the pain is horrible and i am still just shitting and vomiting stomach acid,pre-pandemic
we all know that health anxiety strikes when we are already anxious it often serves as a twisted escape mechanism so we can avoid facing difficult situations or decisions after all how can i worry about that stressful situation with schoolworkfamilyfriendsetc when im focused on selfdiagnosing my mystery disease we often poke and prod and stare at ourselves in the mirror searching for things to get anxious over because we are consciously or subconsciously avoiding a bigger and more real situation stay busy stay selfaware hold yourself accountable for addressing stressful situations in your life rather than burying your head in the sand and diverting your whole focus to your ha hold yourself accountable to stop googling stop symptom searching stop reassurance seeking hold yourself accountable to take care of yourself because you arent going to be healthy if you dont put in the effort keep yourself healthy my ha has been flaring up this week ive been anxious about dvt you know what else is going on in my life stress at work stress from driving in snowice a stressful job hunt stressful upcoming exams on top of all of that i havent been diligent about taking care of my mental health ive slacked on my selfcare hygiene routine of meditation and yoga its a recipe for a ha flareup and instead of continuing to hyperfocus on the tiny possibility of my slight leg pains being something catastrophic im going to make the conscious decision to get back to focusing on myself and my future and the things that matter i will not give in to the temptation to put my difficult decisions on the back burner so i can obsess about something that isnt even real,pre-pandemic
two months ago i went to my psychiatrist after being stable for a year and asked her for adderall i made a total fool of myself what i didnt realize is that i was on a downward spiral all of my responsibilities have been unmanageable but i didnt realize it slowly but surely my mental health declined until it was affecting me physically i was having acid reflux that was so severe it was making me vomit even though i take zantac every night the reflux was worse when i was late to work every day so it was happening because of stress i havent been myself in months a couple of days ago after i quit yet another job i realized i need a time out but we need an income i dont want ssi just time to get healthy the welfare office agreed to give me cash assistance if i got a medical waiver saying i cant work i fully expected my doctor to say no i thought asking for six months off was too much but she agreed with me she told me she knew from experience that a person who has been stable asking for a control is a sign theyre slipping she said she knows how hard i work and its understandable that i need a time out my doctor gave me eight months minimum she will let me have up to 12 months if i need it im going to use this time to completely overhaul my life and get help it just feels so damn good to be validated,pre-pandemic

hello so first things first i do not have autism but i believe that someone in a discord server i am in is lying about having autism and basically being abused for attention or trying to get pity for some reason i have very little knowledge about severe autism which the person claims to have and i do not want to go and accuse them in case i am wrong ad that would severely hurt them however would i person with severe autism consistently misspell words like word in a consistent manner would the misspellings be caused by theyre pronunciation of the word sorry if this is the wrong place for this or if this causes any negative emotions i think its really messed up if this person is using autism to get people to pity her or whatever,pre-pandemic
does anyone else experience this flavor of crazy i can meet someone and have the most interesting charming fun intelligent conversation that engages my mind and my sense of humor on many levels all of them pleasant and then i dont want to see them again because it feels like i cant be her again even though she is no more interesting charming fun or intelligent than i am i wasnt putting on an act when i met that person i was instead somehow able to enter a tiny window of not feeling self conscious i might even think something like ah the problem was that i hadnt been meeting interesting enough people but now that i have ill be okay and can have a solid friend then suddenly i feel like if i made someone like me or warm up to me i can only let them down next time or that id have to fake it to be with them again in reality i didnt make them do anything they probably simply liked me but the thought of that throws my mind into all sorts of turmoil because i dont know who it was that they liked i end up feeling a lot safer but emptier and much more lonely hanging around people who are so self centered that they barely know the other person is there or has any feelings,pre-pandemic
surprise i lived the water was quite a bit deeper than i thought and luckily there were no rocks or tree branches just below the surface i went headfirst so any debri would have likely killed me outright or knocked me out and caused me to drawn i still got a concussion just from the water fyi concussions suck do not recommend and after i somehow managed to not drown anyway i swam to shore holy crap was it a long cold walk home believe it or not i didnt think it was that big a deal it didnt really feel like a true suicide attempt more like it blurred the lines between self harm and suicide before the jump i had figured a 90 chance id live if the water was deep i was gambling a lot on that if when i got home i told my family thinking they would just let me go to sleep with some asprin maybe take the next day off nope not a chance we went straight to the er then i was volunteered to go to the inpatient psychiatric unit the psych ward i was pretty terrified i didnt think i was worthy of such care my issues were mild werent they it was just extreme self harm i spent five days in the hospital and frankly they were some of the most incredible days ive ever experienced in my life i dealt with both extreme pain and euphoria at several points i was the hysterical crying inconsolable woman who youd expect to find in a padded room wearing a straight jacket but they didnt do that to me they talked to me and they helped me they gave me the mental and emotional tools to help myself somehow they got me to admit that i wanted to live even though i desperately believed i didnt deserve to im trying to remember every minute of every day that i do deserve to live anyway thats kinda my little story tldr jumped off a bridge landed in a psych ward got legit help edit wow thanks for the support everyone ill try to answer your questions in more detail when i get a chance edit 2 this got a bit more attention than i thought but im glad if this enourages even one person to consider asking for help or joining an inpatient phsyciatric program ill be overjoyed,pre-pandemic

ive been struggling with a horrible anxiety flareup for the past 7 weeks ive made plenty of other posts if you want more details basically its hit a new peak this past week it started after my family left for a camping trip and i went to stay with some friends ive had the im gonna die feeling and the other physical symptoms since this started but they began feeling worse eventually after hours of struggling on saturday i had a panic attack much worse than my previous two i actually thought i was going to die i ended up passing out from hyperventilating and drinking too much water leading to dangerously low salt levels and having a seizure ending up in the hospital im still traumatized from the experience i was literally just with the doctor yesterday he told me i was fine and not to worry about my heart that should be enough to get rid of this feeling but despite all the times im told that im not dying i still fucking feel like im dying and it gets worse every day its hard for me to describe i get extremely dissociated and feel like im watching an artificial version of my life on a tv screen and its scary because my brain thinks im drifting away from reality its like my life is the show and my body and brain hate watching it so theyre trying to turn it off this combined with the physical symptoms heart palpitations numbness chest tightness trouble breathing shakiness nausea popping ears head pressure diarrhea lightheadedness dizziness left arm pain blurred and sometimes distorted vision intrusive thoughts and overanalyzing every tiny fucking little feeling creates this constant feeling that i am about to pass out or die i dont know what to do it keeps getting worse every day im not able to go to the store anymore i cant get sleep because im scared of dying in my sleep im tired of being told distract yourself by watching tv or go outside as if that will magically cure me i can never do the breathing exercises or meditation because of how difficult it is for me to breathe steadily i try my hardest to ignore it and move on to something else but it is just so crippling and on top of this i convienientely caught a cold today so i get many more feelings to overanalyze im going to go to therapy soon once i find a good plan the hospital took me off of prozac but i did start adavan recently sorry for the long rant im just totally hopeless and scared,pre-pandemic

often in the middle of having a good time and expressing that i am in form of smiling or laughing i get this reminder in the back of my head i dont deserve to be in a good mood me appearing happy feels like a lie considering everything i struggle with i also get this feeling of wanting others to recognize me not being well and if i laugh too much none will know how i actually feel i am okay in social interactions just an extreme anxiety after encounters not that much before or during why did i joke and appear so sociable ive told this person i struggle every day and now im here appearing like everythings normal when its not i also have borderline personality disorder trying to make sense of things,pre-pandemic
maybe i have more severe problems than just adhd but no medication or therapy seems to be helping with school neither does any amount of making the same mistakes im in my second try at college at age 25 and im not doing anything better i start skipping class just because i dont want to go because its boring and then i get behind and dont want to go back for that reason ive skipped one class for three weeks i read a lot of people on here say that last minute panic helps them push through under severe pressure and get work done but i dont think thats worked on me since i was 18 i feel literally nothing when academic deadlines pass im not depressed i just dont care about school at all but i logically recognize how important a degree is to my quality of life and how much harder it will be without one i also recognize the continuing disappointment i cause my parents at this point my question is not how can i do better in school my question is how can i even learn to care about school how can i learn to care about anything i dont immediately want to do i dont ever do anything i dont want to do,pre-pandemic

i bought a car with the intent of restoring it but in reality i dont know how to i havent been in school since september 2018 and nobody noticed ive lost all my friends they all think i dont exist anymore the most painful thing i hear every day is oh sorry anon i must have forgotten you people only recognise me when they want to mock me all i do all day is sit and stare at my computer screen i have no goals or plans in life and now its too late to set any i fall in love with any girl that shows the slightest bit of attention towards me and i cant help it im probably going to kill myself and end it by the end of the year and nobody seems to care if you actually read this then thank you im a human being too and im glad i was recognised,pre-pandemic
it boggles my mind im currently in the grips of an addiction that im positive will kill me if i dont get help either dying from withdrawal or dying from committing suicide in a drunken state i dont know what happened but its never been this bad the moment alcohol leaves my system i begin to shake and sweat i feel like my heart and chest slow down and i cant breathe ive gotten to the point where i have to constantly have alcohol in my system i quit for almost two months about two months ago and its been a fast crazy downhill spiral i wouldve never imagined i could be in this position im thinking i need to go to detox but i cant leave my dog is there a way to somehow detox yourself at home i went to the er on the weekend where they kept me for two days and i was given atavin to help with withdrawals yet when i got home i drank i cant go to rehab because i have no one to care for my dog any advice would be great tia,pre-pandemic
i suffer from ptsd and anxiety disorder with bouts of depression ive developed this through my time in the military due to things i have endured or witnessed although most are noncombat related i came here to seek a community of those who can understand what im going through upon coming here i so often see people start their posts with im not in the military or referring to their lack of military service as invalidating their ptsd ive read enough of those statements to motivate me to come here and say one simple thing your ptsd is valid stop feeling the need to defend your traumatic experiences when comparing them to military members with ptsd your trauma is no less real than what i experienced my uniform does not strengthen my need for ptsd treatment any more or less than any of you many of you nonmilitary ptsd sufferers have gone through things much worse than i or many other people in the military you are valid your ptsd is real your trauma happened and you deserve treatment and support and most of all you will heal see you all on the other side thanks for being americans worth fighting and dying for thanks for being nonamericans worth serving and fighting for thanks for being good people,pre-pandemic
if i had a gun it would be easier but my only options all require pain i just have to get past the pain part and ill be good to go edit i really dont care for what comes after i die i just know that its better than dealing with whats here for me trust me ive tried my best to keep moving forward in this world but its all been pointless i have no fear of being dead i just struggle with the natural human instinct of fearingavoiding pain if theres one thing in this life that im sure of its that i want to die and its not a fleeting thought i think about it the majority of every day the fact that so many individuals in the comments feel similarly is heartbreaking some of us are not fortunate or strong enough to go on living some of us have been beat down by life one too many times i wish that was not the case but unfortunately it is its really saddening to see but i sympathize because i feel the same,pre-pandemic
then how do we all feel so alone,pre-pandemic
this post is about my experience with health anxiety and how i totally overcame it i hope this can help someone out there going through probably the most scary time of their life the beginning a year and a half ago i developed the symptoms of dry eye syndrome light sensitivity trouble reading otherwise i was a totally healthy 21 year old male when i shared the symptoms with a relative she convinced me it must be something terrible like diabetes or ms rather than immediately consult a doctor i spent the next couple of weeks googling symptoms sure enough a few days after first reading the symptoms of ms my left leg started to become relentlessly tense one night my leg continually tensed up every couple of minutes and made it impossible to sleep when i finally got out of bed in the morning i went to take a shower in the hot shower my head started to feel hot and i suddenly felt very nauseous i ran over to the sink and dry heaved and then my vision started to fade to black after sitting down on the floor my vision slowly came back but i was already convinced something was seriously wrong with me went to the er all tests came back clear and they sent me home they didnt know what caused it but said that sometimes it just happens in the back of my mind i already knew that something was wrong with me and continued to google symptoms to try and solve my own case over that next month i went back to the emergency room 4 times had an ambulance come to my house and spent a night in the hospital the time the ambulance came to my house both of my arms had gone completely numb from hyperventilation during a panic attack and i was convinced i was going to die i vividly remember the nurse asking me on a scale of 110 how much pain are you in and i answered im not in any pain i just feel like im about to die as far as i could tell my body was being controlled by a mysterious illness that could suddenly onset at any time and make me feel like i was about to pass out every time i went to the emergency room i said basically the same thing i feel light headed like im going to pass out only of course they knew that wasnt really what was happening because my blood pressure was always just fine unfortunately no one really conveyed this to me i developed a severe case of agoraphobia i went from being an independent adult male to sleeping in the same bed as my safe person again because i was so scared something was going to happen to me in my sleep because this all started with me passing out in the shower i became deathly afraid of the shower i didnt shower for almost two months i couldnt really leave the house at all and if i had to i had to stay near my safe person at all times i couldnt do something as simple as sit alone in a store even just walking into the store made me feel a strong sudden wave of anxiety turning the corner during my four emergency room visits and hospital stay i had an unbelievable amount of tests done i got two ct scans of my head two chest xrays an mri a heart echo a stress test about 20 blood tests a 24 hour heart monitor as well as many other tests all came back negative and oddly enough not one doctor ever mentioned the possibility that it could just be anxiety i had to figure this out on my own the exact instant i realized i had health anxiety was when i finally realized that i could actually trigger my symptoms for example every time i would go to a doctors appointment i felt like i was going to pass out this happened whether it was an appointment with my primary care physician or my ophthalmologist i literally had to lay down in the waiting room of my ophthalmologist because i just felt so light headed when i would go there but then oddly enough i noticed that the symptoms totally subsided on the way home every time it seems almost impossible to not put two and two together here but it took me months to realize that perhaps it was anxiety causing me to experience these symptoms and that this would explain why they onset right before going to a doctors appointment at this point after googling i came across white coat syndrome and i knew what i had i told my neurologist i thought it may just be anxiety he said it was possible but he wanted to run some more tests i let him run the tests but in the meantime i started to treat the anxiety on my own with lifestyle changes i started going out for strenuous walks for thirty minutes a day as a form of exercise even though my heart felt like it was palpitating out of my chest and i was scared to death i started forcing myself to do things on my own the first thing i did on my own was stand in line without my safe person to get my allergy medication prescription at a pharmacy i felt strongly like i was going to pass out and desperately wanted to go sit down but the book i read said the only way i could treat the anxiety was to face the fear and try and force myself to pass out of course i never did pass out it was all in my head after just about a month of self care my extreme agoraphobia was gone i was taking showers again once a day and i was going out and doing things completely by myself a few months later i got an opportunity to take my treatment to the next level move across the country to live with a friend for a couple of months i took the opportunity to finally break away from my safe person all together and it turned out to be the final piece the remaining minor symptoms i had dissipated conclusion this is a heavily condensed version of my story it would be nearly impossible to go into full detail as this took place over a grueling 89 months i would however like to list some of the symptoms i experienced that totally went away i think this could be helpful to someone who has some of these symptoms and has been told its anxiety but doesnt quite believe it or think they will go away dont get me wrong if you have any of these symptoms and you havent been checked out you need to do that first until you remove that piece of doubt from your mind your recovery will be much harder symptoms i experienced at one point or another that are now totally gone panic attacks 4 er visits in a month 1 ambulance call sensations of abnormal heart beat sweating arms going numb hyperventilation extremely tense painful left leg this happened for weeks at a time caused by stress according to neurologist constant eye twitching not like tourettes but rather a constant twitching sensation in the eyelid sensation of abnormal heartbeat i was obsessed with my heartbeat and convinced something was wrong with it i could notice it at almost all times feeling of not getting enough air in this was a strong sensation i often had around bed time i literally felt like i was just not breathing in enough air to survive trying to control my breathing this was one of the most frustrating symptoms i could not seem to take my mind off of controlling my breathing i found a simple cure for this in the section below ringing in the ears sometimes it was constant for days at a time sometimes it was one of my ears suddenly going out for a few minutes seeing things shapes colors etc when my eyes were closed this is one of the weirdest ones because at the time it greatly concerned me and i remember always paying attention to what i could see with my eyes closed and now i cant even remember what they looked like or ever paying attention to that again feeling of lightheadedness pretty self explanatory very common in anxiety arms going numb this would happen any time i was in a stressful situation for example before a doctors appointment or even when i went and played poker a couple of months after i had mostly recovered and even then every time i bluffed my arms would start to tingle and eventually go borderline numb was told this has to do with the adrenaline overloading my system 247 constantly feeling off balance like the floor is a bouncy castle i went to the doctor specifically for this issue as well and he checked my ears and assured me this sensation was all in my head and it turns out it was was a very freaky thing i was literally having to lean on the countertops in the kitchen just to wash dishes at one point and now it is totally gone derealization i would constantly get the sensation that my arms werent really my arms or that i couldnt feel my face i would literally pinch my arms every few minutes just to make sure they were mine and that i could feel them developed an extreme sensitivity to caffeine used to drink 400mg in the morning now i couldnt even drink a cup of coffee without feeling sick to my stomach doctor told me to quit altogether so i tapered off until i quit constantly lifting my arms smiling due to fear of having a stroke since one time the doctor mentioned i may of had a minor stroke i became obsessed with lifting my arms to make sure one wasnt weaker than the other and smiling to make sure my face wasnt drooping the list goes on and on much of the stuff i am no doubt forgetting tips start an exercise program much of anxiety is simply excess energy that needs to get expended its much harder to be anxious when you are tired and besides if you have anxiety related to your heartbeat this is a way to face that the first few days i was convinced my heart was beating like crazy just when walking but the more you do it the less it happens and eventually it goes away all together the goal is to desensitize yourself from focusing on your heart beat always face your fears every time you give in to anxiety it grows a little bit every time you face it it shrinks a little bit this is the basis of all treatment for anxiety anxiety makes you uncomfortable but it is not harmful the goal is to recognize that it is purely discomfort and there is really nothing to be afraid of for dealing specifically with the focusing on breathing thing i recommend a great article here this article literally single handedly cured this symptom and this is the one that i experienced the longest of all of them even after everything was gone i could not seem to stop focusing on my breathing the gist of the article is that you are doing this because you are scared of the thought of focusing on your breathing you are scared by the idea that you cannot stop and so your brain keeps paying attention because your brain loves scary things so in sense make paying attention to your breathing as boring as possible set alarms throughout the day to remind you to pay attention to your breathing seems counter intuitive but wow does it actually work read as much literature as you can from well reputed sources on health anxiety and panic attacks i recommend especially dare but i would also simply recommend watching this short video i also used an anxietyphobiapanic attack workbook that helped a lot although i cannot remember the name of it now never ever google symptoms ever not because you should be scared by what you find because you shouldnt but because you arent smart enough to recognize that you shouldnt be scared if everyone could take their findings with a grain of salt and recognize that they have no idea what they are doing and should draw no conclusions from what they find there would be no issue but everyone thinks of themselves as smart and competent and so they think they are likely to come up with accurate conclusions wrong even people who know the relevant biology and anatomy cant properly dissect a medical journal and you think you can do it as a layman doctors understand things about frequencies and qualifying characteristics for diagnoses that none of us will ever understand and cant be found in a quick google search please leave anything medically related up to the professionals at all times considering taking a calcium magnesium zinc supplement recommended by many resources for dealing with anxiety you should probably quit caffeine i was the biggest coffee head you can imagine and even though i was forced to quit by an extreme sensitivity to caffeine i developed i probably would of quit anyway life is much better without it anyways its hard to imagine why i ever needed it in the first place at this point now i just wake up and feel great not like i need a cup of coffee immediately copious amounts of decaf satisfy my requirements for the taste of black coffee i dont really use reddit very often so i dont plan on sticking around the community to help people or anything i just wanted to make my one big contribution and give back the best way i could by creating a post i think will help someone out there and i wanted to do it before it was too late and ive moved on so far that i totally forget the details of this thing that happened to me best of luck to all of you life is really great when you dont think you are dying all of the time,pre-pandemic
like it almost feels you are the predator in a way since you keep your eyes on people and their movements my traumatic experiences have caused me to become very hyper aware and vigilant my eyes follow and observe people like a hawk so i stay safe and avoid such people who i feel will hurt me againwhich in my case translates to everyone but the thing is i believe everyone is a threat so my eyes follow and watch everybody through my peripheral vision beyond my control as if my subconscious is taking over and shutting down what i can control in the present time the thing is having this issue is nearly destroying my life i will literally stare everybody down until they are out of my eyesight lol i have caused hostility frustration and creeped out people but its like my animal brain doesnt care or listen to me or their responses its incredibly difficult if not impossible to be in a classroom it making me really want to drop out because i am more focused on the people around me than the teacherboard people notice this and i make them incredibly nervous because of it i cant speak or relax in group setting since my eyes will dart around scanning the environment as if i am still in danger i am only completely at peace when i am completely alone i have tried therapy and some medications but it hasnt helped much not to mention im always encountering negative social experiences which just amplifies the problem even more anyone else have something similar,pre-pandemic
im not gonna grow old im gonna be dead ive been wanting to commit suicide for a long time now if i cant take it anymore ill just kill myself,pre-pandemic
i love when i finally make a friend i can relate too and we talk pretty often it feels nice meeting someone and that feeling of loneliness goes away finally you guys talk everyevery other day and you feel like you finally made a friend no you then notice they stop replying at a normal time and then youre lucky if you get a response ins 24 hours you figure theyre just busy so you let them be but you see them playing everything you used to play together with someone else or without you you dont say anything because you dont want to be clingy and eventually they stop replying completely you message them again and they completely ignore it and youre back to being lonely wondering if youre just boring annoying or both,pre-pandemic
ive been so depressed for years i always thought the end was coming up so i slowly just faded out in many relationships over time the few people who were important to me have either died or just stopped talking to me after seeing the 2 sides of the coin mostly the dark side thats no fun and has a haunted look 247 i have been attempting to connect with people ive started being more social but nothing is taking i feel like im so impatient for relationships to develop that i just dont put in any effort because im honestly just out of practice i did reach out to one of those important people and the few times we did hang out it was amazing and felt safe but they just kind of stopped wanting to hang out or just got really busy with life i just want someone who i can talk candidly with about everything so far thats only my doctor which im pretty sure why we see each other every other week now i suck at this and im a really great person who will pretty much do anything for a good friend but getting to that point now seems impossible,pre-pandemic
edit title of the song is never google your symptoms whoops,pre-pandemic
i would love for things to stop time to hold still and so slowly fade suicide will never be that peaceful i think abt death often i dont necessarily have plans for life im just patiently waiting for death like at a bus stop i might read a book to pass time but my destination is so peaceful i cant help but to want to go there im constantly afraid of everything feeling silence would be amazing point of this idk i never told anyone this cus they would worry but i feel like i need to dont worry tho most likely i wont be taking an active role ive desired death even stronger than now and ive been too afraid so edit thanks for the comments its nice knowing im not alone if anyone would like advice since im just waiting at my bus stop doing what i can enjoy has been a great way to spend time im in love with art but hey if geeky stuff or insects is ur calling yo for it without shame its probably gonna be the thing keeping u alive,pre-pandemic
the 13th of this month will be the longest ive stayed clean since i was 17 i am now almost 25 mind you i still smoke marijuana to sleep sometimes and occasionally have a drink and i mean one i know most people dont consider this clean but damnit im taking my victory over the substance that repeatedly tried to take my life my family and any future i may have had this is possible you can do it i have cravings not sure that they will ever go away 100 but i am more spiritually grounded now than ever before as well all im trying to say is that it is possible dont give up,pre-pandemic

no we dont need to know that there are so many posts that say that exact same thing if you procrastinate a lot it doesnt mean you absolutely have adhd you could just be lazy a lot of symptoms of adhd are too broad and so you might think that does anyone else agree also they can search up the question,pre-pandemic
they say looks dont matter but unfortunately that isnt true for some of us the amount of grooming styling and exercising we do just cant fix bad genes while adults may not judge someone on face value if they are unattractive being made fun of as a kid leads to a chain of effects get made fun for appearance as a kidteen dont have anyone to hang with shattered confidence staying home on weekends and not talking much during school not developing social skills being socially inept as an adult most of my quirks are in my bone structure so it would take some serious plastic surgery to address them im so angry at myself for skipping on an opportunity to fix a very big flaw with my appearance 5 years ago because some yesmen convinced me i was okay im not,pre-pandemic

i suffer from pretty severe dissociation particularly derealization where nothing feels real and it feels like an observer of my thoughts and im just watching a movie through my eyes i met a lovely guy and were very similar in that were both introverted want to connect over deep meaningful talks and we are both sensitive i opened up to him over skype today saying that i am worried that i wont remember him and if we dont talk my brain will tell me that i was dreaming him and our interactions never happened he reacted in the most heartwarming way possible he told me he was going to send me frequent letters in the mail he lives abroad and my favourite hot cheetos just so whenever i doubt myself i can just read and hold the letter to remind myself that hes real and there for me it was so meaningful that i cried right there and then i feel on top of the world,pre-pandemic

i know this sounds so like something so basic but lately my anxiety has been really bad preventing me from doing things i had to ship an item that someone bought off me online and i kept putting it off this week because i was too anxious to go to the post office and wasnt sure what i would do once i got there my boyfriend told me that i should try to go because this was something i needed to do since i already got paid for the item sometimes all you need is some support from one person to tell you that youll be fine about a certain situation once i got back i felt so relieved it was something so easy to do and i was just overthinking it and making myself more anxious but in reality there was nothing to be anxious about i just personally felt proud of myself and wanted to write this in case anyone has been dealing with similar anxiety we always tend to make out situations to be worse than they actually are and you wont know the outcome and that most of the time your anxiety is wrong unless you try,pre-pandemic

so if youre reading this and currently in the midst of an anxiety disorder let me start by saying i know how you feel ive had panic attacks where the adrenaline rushes just dont stop ive been nauseated and unable to eat or drink for days on end ive felt so short of breath it was like drowning above water had the jitters and the lump in my throat ive also had all of the uncomfortable mental symptoms ive dissociated for almost a full day multiple times ive had racing intrusive thoughts that lasted weeks and sometimes months at a time and ive felt like i was going crazy a lot but im here to tell you my struggle with my anxiety disorder is over after almost a year of conscious and concerted effort all of the worst symptoms of my anxiety are completely gone some of the more mild ones still appear from time to time ill get fatigued or dizzyfoggy maybe once every few weeks but this happens so infrequently and becomes less frequent with each occurrence that it doesnt really bug me i was also on medication an ssri since day one and a benzo for the first few months and am in the process of tapering off so i wanted to write a post about how to get over each stage of your anxiety mainly because i know i really would have appreciated this kind of guidance when i first sought help in late april of last year if you want a summary of things you can do regardless of what stage youre at scroll to the bottom and check the paragraph in bold i dont discuss responses to specific symptoms here just a general approach if youre looking for tactics for specific symptoms check out the list of books i left in the second section i think the first one does a particularly good job of addressing every symptom but you can try the third if you dont feel it makes enough of a difference before you read i want to mention something once so i dont have to later on recovery is going to be like a rollercoaster some days youll feel like you made incredible progress and others youll have difficulty even doing simple tasks its going to be a lot of two steps forward one step back sometimes itll even be two steps forward two steps back but even those times are okay because they serve as proof that you are capable of improving just know that once you start to give effort things will start gradually getting better so here it is my comprehensive guide to recovering from an anxiety disorder if youre at a constant 910 1010 anxiety and cant calm down at this stage youre either in the middle of panic attack which lasts up to 60 minutes or you have gad and are constantly anxious i was diagnosed with gad and pureo but ive had maaaaaany panic attacks so i know this advice will work for both 1 stop trying to fight your anxiety symptoms understand that the best thing you can do for your body right now is just let it run its course this is the basis of acceptance and commitment therapy act which is one of the types of therapy currently used to treat anxiety disorders to do this dont try to stop any symptoms you are experiencing this is infinitely easier said than done at first but with practice youll be able to pick this up fairly quickly when i was first having constant adrenaline rushes i kept trying to consciously stop them this was actually making things worse the more you try to fight your symptoms the more worried you become which in turn causes your system to release more of the stresscausing hormones causing your symptoms to become worse the best thing you can do at this point is wait it out and let your body tire itself out questions doubts and fear will come up when they do remind yourself that this is a totally normal process that your body is going through and try to rest in the anxiety it may be difficult but try to ease into the symptoms this was initially what helped my adrenaline rushes decrease in severity and frequency if this isnt working and you find your symptoms are still persisting and wont stop ask for more as the dare response discussed later puts it run towards your symptoms if youve ever read a book on act this step is likely in there when you ask your body to make your symptoms worse youll find it cant the symptoms of anxiety are driven by a subconscious worry and not something you can control keep running towards it until your symptoms gradually begin to ease then move on to step 2 in case youre interested the clinical term for this is arousal reappraisal its not discussed very often but i found it to be very helpful 2 do anything you possibly can to get your mind off of the anxiety in older forms of anxiety treatment this kind of thing was referred to as a distraction tactic but in the dare response barry mcdonagh calls it being engaged this basically means do whatever you can to focus your mind on something other than your anxiety regardless of what level of anxiety youre at this is incredibly important your anxiety is most easily fueled when you focus on it so do whatever you can to move your attention to something else again much easier said than done and your mind will fight you at every stage but its an integral part of recovery when i first started out i found short activities the most helpful like picking up my guitarcajon and playing a song or two or doing homework 3 give it time your system cant sustain anxiety levels this high for an extended period of time unless you consciously fuel it if you are properly easing into your symptoms and engaging yourself in other activities youll eventually calm down to the next phase of anxiety recovery 4 if recommended by your physician a benzo might help benzos are basically nervous system relaxants but theyre no magic pill when i took my first dose of valium i didnt feel a thing it took a few days of constant dosing to see any effect benzos are fine to use in the very beginning but i will issue a warning about them try to use them as sparingly as possible benzos are not meant to be used in the long term and if the first thing you do when feeling anxious is reach for your benzo youll have real difficulty recovering in the later stages but since at this point youre in a constant state of panic theyre a great way to ease you down to the next lowest stage of anxiety so you can start focusing on the long term 5 journal i dont recommend this as much beyond this stage as ive found it doesnt really help all that much but in the beginning stages of my experience with gad i found journaling to be an indispensable asset to really figure out what i was going through just write out whatever youre thinking or feeling its a great what to get out of your head for at least a little bit 6 get up and do something to release all your pent up adrenaline walk around the block take a stretch break at work you dont need to be doing a full workout at this point just something to help you use the jitters and adrenaline youre getting for something productive 7 this one may seem rather minor but it helped me a lot in the beginning fix your posture its much easier to feel short of breath when youre in a position that doesnt let you breath easily if youre lying down lay on your back if youre sitting sit up straight once youve thoroughly calmed down from this point this took me about three or four weeks you can move on to the next step constant 6 810 with occasional panic attacks if youre at this phase you are probably still experiencing physical manifestations of your anxiety like jitters nausea jelly legs shortness of breath and so on but youre not in constant freakout mode anymore you can make logical decisions aimed more at long term recovery because rather than being focused on your anxiety 100 of the time you pay attention to it 80 90 of the time you may be leaving the house occasionally but your symptoms are still bad enough that they keep you at home most of the time so heres what to do at this stage 1 start reading or listening to books on what youre going through the more you understand the subtleties of whats going on in your brain and body the better youll be able fix them read up on therapy techniques as theyll be your quickest route to recovery in the end this ended up being the single most helpful thing for my recovery when youre knowledgeable of exactly what is at your disposal you can try everything and see what works best for you in fact i found really helpful ideas in books that none of my therapists had even heard of like your anxiety the list of books that will be the most helpful for you is very personalized but here are my recommendations all of these books are available on audible which is how i consumed them the dare response phenomenal book written by someone whos been through the worst parts of anxiety and paved his own path to recovery his techniques are a combination between act and a little cbt i would especially recommend this book if youre at the higher end of the anxiety scale feeling good the new mood therapy this book is considered the gold standard of cbt its aimed at treating depression but as the author notes it works for anxiety as well i listened to the whole thing then picked out the chapters i thought applied to me its long so i dont think you need to do the first part but theres a lot of valuable information in this book that a lot of other books skim over rewire your anxious brain this one is 14 cbt 14 lifestyle guidance and half about the neuroscience behind anxiety i like this one a lot because it gets into some of the mechanics of why we feel the way we do and why therapy and lifestyle changes are so impactful the subtle art of not giving a fuck this one has been mentioned on this subreddit several times before and i really like it it serves as a great reminder of why some things in life just arent worth giving a fuck about fair warning mark manson describes ocd as an incurable disease in this book hes not a doctor or therapist and isnt really knowledgeable on the subject so id take that section with a grain of salt but the message he drives home at the end is really good regardless remember the point of these books isnt to give you step by step instructions on how to get better rather they are there to give you ideas on how to best help yourself 2 get into therapy this is perhaps the second most important things you can do for yourself behind reading therapy is the first line of treatment for anxiety and for good reason once you find a therapist who you work well with youll notice you progress much more quickly some things to look out for when you screen your therapist are they nice kind of an obvious one but worth going over do you feel like they take what youre saying seriously are their answers usually thoughtful and caring are they experienced my first therapist was tremendously nice and caring but he didnt know much about anxiety treatment beyond the very basics like square breathing are they accessible or do you have to drive two hours to see them are they available for weekly sessions or can you only see them once a month it may take a while until you find a therapist whos right for you but this is a person youll be meeting with multiple times a month for several monthsyears i would advise giving your therapist at least three or four sessions before you consider switching to a new one 3 continue with all the acceptance techniques outlined in the previous section these are things that i remind myself of even now the more open you are towards your anxiety symptoms the more quickly theyll dissipate in addition if you can start easing off your benzo a little bit if youre taking it three times a day try to move down to two if youre down to two a day try one 4 start making some lifestyle changes that are proven to help with anxiety in the long term cardiovascular exercise its said that exercise is one of the most positive things to improve mood when youre anxious but id like to look at it from the opposite perspective when youre anxious your body is filled with excess adrenaline that keeps building up if you dont dump it out somehow the symptoms will inevitably get worse so getting up from your desk or your bed is one of the most effective things you can do to help yourself in the long term if youre not super exercise savvy my suggestion is to get out and walk jogging occasionally walking is great for releasing excess energy but you can boost the speed at which you let off adrenaline by running you dont need to do sprints whenever you run but youll get the most out of your exercise if you really challenge yourself each time more on this later meditation the reason so many people say this is so good for anxiety is because it helps you better come to terms with your symptoms it also lets you really hone in on some of the less productive thought processes youre having so you can learn to catch and correct them keep in mind the purpose of meditation is not to clear your mind and think of nothing in fact its almost the opposite while meditating your job is to let your body and brain work as normal and merely try to act as a conscious observer of all your thoughts and feelings a really popular visualization technique for this is thinking of your thoughts as clouds and youre just watching them pass by there is plenty of information out there on how to meditate and it includes helpful techniques like noting so i wont go into it that much here make sure that your approach to meditation is similar to your approach to exercise slowly ease into it by doing it for short periods at first then working up very gradually to longer periods after every couple sessions i suggest trying out the meditation app calm diet if youre reading this youve probably read the dos and donts of your diet about a hundred times but ill reiterate quickly here no caffeine no alcohol try your best to avoid excessive sweets and fried foods and those are shown 1 to worsen your mood in the long term one of the less known changes you can make to your diet is to include more natural sources of magnesium it is speculated 2 that magnesium plays a part in anxiety regulation though the research isnt entirely there yet regardless try to include dark leafy greens like spinach and whole grains like brown rice into your diet to hit this as a staple you can also take a magnesium supplement ill defer to the dare response for information about it though again research is shaky so this alone wont bring change medication this one will be completely at youyour doctors discretion some people respond well to antidepressants some dont i didnt feel like they helped me all that much but you might note the purpose of antidepressants isnt to make you happy or to gradually cure your anxiety research shows 3 that antidepressants are useful for supplementing long term change in the brain this is a really important thing to note because it means that antidepressants wont change anything on their own only if you give conscious effort will you be able to see positive change medication only makes it happen more quickly 5 give it time your nervous system doesnt change overnight it may need a week or two more before you achieve the results you want so just keep practicing your therapy techniques and doing everything you know works and push through once youve been at these things for a while youll notice your anxiety start to decrease to the next phase hovering around 4 6 if youre at this stage congratulations the first two stages are really hard to break out of and if you did it likely took a tremendous amount of effort so give yourself a pat on the back once youve reached this stage your anxiety likely doesnt manifest itself physically as much you may still get nauseated occasionally but most of the time youre able to eat and drink and hopefully sleep through the night youve started reclaiming your normal life you get out of the house relatively frequently and do things like run errands but youre still really anxious whenever you go out in addition though your physical symptoms may have eased up your mental symptoms may still be incredibly difficult to deal with so heres what you should do at this stage 1 keep staying the course its easy to flounder or stop and its okay if you do but remember to pick up right where you left off also dont beat yourself up for making mistakes everyone falters from time to time its part of what makes us human and its okay if things are taking longer than you expected take it from me that if you keep looking for ways you can improve your anxiety and practicing the techniques you know work things will get better 2 keep pushing the envelope identify areas of your life that youve always been anxious about and challenge yourself to use therapy techniques to improve them i used to beat myself up for being awkward ever since i was a little kid id find flaws in every interaction i had with others and nitpick every little thing once i started working on this i noticed not only an improvement in these kinds of situations but also an improvement in my overall anxiety this is part of how exposure and response prevention erp therapy works you expose yourself to situations that make your anxiety flare up and use cbt techniques to curb your conscious worry an important note about this is these experiences arent meant to be fun if youve got social anxiety and youre challenging yourself by going to meet new people itll likely be an uncomfortable experience the first few times people around you may be having plenty of fun while you keep worrying and criticizing yourself but youll slowly notice improvement and with time itll become more and more natural over time 3 along the same lines start making your workouts more difficult runbikeswim for longer lift heavier weights when youre anxious you tend to stagnate in certain areas of your life sometimes without realizing it the only way to get better is to keep pushing the bounds of what you do i saw a post on this subreddit a while ago along the lines of ive been lightly jogging for 25 minutes a day for the last month or two why arent i seeing my anxiety improve and the answer in this case is because this person wasnt pushing himherself if you continue to do the same things you shouldnt expect to see improvement 4 start identifying and cutting off some of your crutchesunhealthy habits for a lot of us me included this comes in the form of googling symptoms or constantly asking for help on this subreddit its okay to cave every once in a while at this stage but you need to consciously stop yourself from constantly asking for help on the internet one of the things this does is keep you focused on your anxiety which is exactly what engaging yourself is meant to prevent i stopped browsing this subreddit for almost a half year and my condition got much better as a result if youre seriously concerned about something visit your doctorpsychiatristtherapist and ask them but once they diagnose you do not second guess it i spent my entire college career going to different doctors i think at least 10 or 11 different types sometimes multiple doctors of each kind i was convinced there was something wrong with me that no one could find but the true culprit was anxiety if you feel like youre constantly sick or dying yet doctors cant find anything wrong this is a clue that you have an issue with being a hypochondriac you can go about fixing this the way you did in all areas of your therapy i personally used the cbt method outlined in feeling good but the important thing is to recognize that just because your brain is telling you something doesnt mean its true 5 give it time ive said it before but its important to reiterate recovering from this stage might take several months so try your best to be patient and remember if things arent the way you want them to be now they will be soon i think its also important to discuss the idea of cognitive fusion which you may have come across in your book reading as i think understanding it will be really helpful google defines cognitive fusion as attaching a thought to an experience but since thats kind of vague ill give my own definition cognitive fusion is when you take what your thoughts tell you as fact in other words youre using your thoughts to draw irrational conclusions about the world around you one example of this is if youre someone who criticizes themselves too much you might tell yourself that conversation was so awkward so that person must think im a loser in this case whether or not the situation was awkward you dont know what the other person is thinking i used to think this a lot until i realized people really didnt see me that way and all the worrying i did was for nothing a healthy level of questioning can do lots to help you overcome your anxiety at this stage i had the most trouble with mental symptoms namely the feeling of going crazy i thought the little floaters in my eyes were hallucinations i always second guessed my own sanity i thought the weird dreams or intrusive thoughts i was having were a sign of schizophrenia and anytime i was happy i thought it was a sign of bipolar disorder this is another great example of cognitive fusion that took me a while to get over i thought i was going crazy so to me that was evidence that i really was if you think this describes you it might do you well to get into the habit of questioning your thoughts as well is it more logical that your psychiatrist therapists family and friends are correct when they say youre not crazy and are just experiencing symptoms of anxiety or that youre the one person out of the fifty whos somehow figured out youre losing it this applies to basically every anxious situation you may encounter remember just because you think something doesnt make it true one of the things that took me a long time to realize was that my constant worry over these things was caused by the fact that i was paying so much attention to them at this point in recovery its absolutely imperative that you keep yourself occupied especially when youre most anxious i found that doing things like cooking and cleaning were ways to keep my mind off my anxiety without having to think about it i suggest doing the same as theyre both productive and beneficial in the end eventually your mind will calm down on its own and youll find your own solutions to these symptoms i find that at this point the really important thing really is time once i felt like i was going crazy for the hundredth time i realized that if every time before this one was a false alarm this one and all the ones after for that matter are false alarms too this stage took about 3 months to recover from but once i did i hit the next stage anxiety is 1 3 most days with some days feeling almost completely anxiety free youre in the home stretch this is it youre likely already giving yourself credit for all the hard work youve done but you should still take a moment to recognize just how far youve come for me having a day where i go out and try something new with friends while anxious is something i wouldnt have been able to do even before my anxiety disorder certainly not anything id ever dreamed of while in the thick of it seriously if youve hit this point the light should be at the end of the tunnel and on the days where its a little harder to deal with let me reassure you youre almost home free note your symptoms will still be present at this point some of the intrusive thoughts might still come sometimes youll have a bit of dissociation or an occasional almostpanic attack but you know how to deal with these things your moments of panic dont last more than a few seconds and your symptoms dont really illicit a response from you at this stage 1 you know what works best for you keep doing it you have your techniques and youve clearly demonstrated they work all thats left is to keep doing them and reap the rewards you know will come on the worse days when your anxiety peaks at a 3 or 4 remind yourself where you were several months ago and how youll never experience anxiety that bad ever again then gently engage yourself in something and ride the wave of anxiety until it subsides 2 slowly lose your crutches if you discuss your anxiety with your friends stop doing so as frequently and eventually stop altogether if youre still occasionally taking benzos slowly taper off the more of your independence you get back the more confident youll feel 3 keep exploring other areas of your life where youve had anxiety and use what youve learned to stop worrying for me this meant things like conquering my fear of heights by going snowboarding and confronting my discomfort with physical and emotional intimacy by going out of my way to discuss these things the more of these longstanding anxieties youre able to ease the better youll feel overall plus you get the added sense of achievement for doing things that past you wouldve never been able to do there really isnt much left to say at this stage i found myself being discouraged more frequently at this point just because i knew i was so close to the finish line but not quite there in case you need any encouragement remind yourself of how well youve done so far and that theres more to come then finally no anxiety with the worst days peaking at a 05 or 1 thats it all the voices in your head telling you youre not good enough have gone silent all those symptoms you used to worry so much about dont really happen anymore you might still be a bit fatigued or foggy some days but most of the time youre energetic present and can confront new challenges with a sense of confidence youve never had its been a few months since youve even given your anxiety a second thought you know some of your symptoms might come back for a short spell every once in a while but youre not worried about them you know exactly what to do when that happens and that theyll go away just as quickly as they came i dont have any advice for this point you know what got you here and have built up the mental fortitude to know youll keep on doing it congratulations you understand how amazing it is that you got to this point remember this feeling my therapist once gave me a great rule of thumb i think sums things up really well whatever your anxiety is telling you to do do the opposite if its telling you not to get out of bed do it if its telling you not to go to a social event do that if its telling you youre going to suffer from some grave illness remind yourself thats not true if its telling you to google your symptoms or ask for help dont if its telling you youre losing your mind remind yourself youre not give it enough time and eventually things will get better summary ease into your symptoms remember that its just anxiety and cant do anything other than make you uncomfortable youve been through this a hundred times before and survived every single time dont fight it when you fight your anxiety it only gets worse so let your anxiety do whatever it wants and just watch as a detached observer keep yourself occupied the more time you spend thinking about your anxiety googling your symptoms posting on this subreddit writing in your journal or just stewing in general the worse off youll be cook clean dance exercise paint draw do anything you can to forcibly rip your mind off your anxiety keep pushing the bounds of what youre doing expose yourself to more anxiety exercise harder try things youve never tried before make your anxiety flare up as much as possible because you know itll only benefit you in the end regularly question your thoughts just because you think something doesnt make it true youll find a hundred times out of a hundred the thing youve been dreading isnt half as horrible as your brain has made it out to be give it time youll find once you experience the same anxiety for the same reason for the thousandth time in a row that it becomes a bit easier to stop believing what it tells you thank you for reading this i really hope

i learned this concept last night and wanted to share you can think of success in life like a club were all trying to get into most people will go in the front door they stand in line wait their turn and work their way forward slowly but surely a select number of exclusive people get to use the back door the are the people who know the right person have the right reputation or could buy their way in but some people cant get in through the front or the back door they need the third door the third door is the unmarked way in its a window a fire escape a roof exit its hiding in the laundry cart when they bring in the linens or disguising yourself and going in the service entrance its a combination of timing ingenuity and effort but you can keep trying until you make it in i often need to remind myself that my route to success is different but that doesnt make it any less real the whole concept of run your own race has been reiterated to me so many times but i find it hard to stop comparing my path to others i have to remind myself just keep trying things never stop innovating ways around your problems fall down nine times and stand up ten i think i feel my best when im in lovable rogue mode because i know i dont feel good at all when im in trying to be normal mode find your third door people and remember if you get into the club you arent a fraud you deserve to be there just as much as anybody else edit holy moly this resonated please everybody keep sharing your stories and experiences maybe we all need to seeremember the breadth of possibility thats truly out there edit thank you u23wings for the original source its a book third door by alex banayan,pre-pandemic

i have a younger coworker who has been feeling self conscious about her weight lately shes well above average regarding looks so its a bit upsetting to me actually after hearing that she wanted to loose weight my friend also a coworker started making some really insensitive comments she was straight up calling our coworker fat and criticizing her for eating after she made my coworker cry i got angry and then she said something again and i fucking snapped i told her that she was being incredibly cruel for no reason she asked why everyone was in such a shitty mood and couldnt take a joke and i replied that she was putting us in a shitty mood by being a bitch now this may seem like a pretty benign thing but you have to understand that i am a coward i have never stood up for anyone other then meekly asking to change the topic im still shaking and this was over 3 hours ago i think i lost a friend today im damn happy about it because how dare she though seriously good riddance she was pissed off and for the first time in my life i dont care that someone is mad at me im pretty proud of that edit oh my god thank you so much for all of the niceness ive been feeling pretty shitty the past few days so it really brightened my week,pre-pandemic
hey listen i have been where you have been im 27 years old and in the past year ive had the following symptoms twitching all over my body numb arms in the morning such blurry vision i couldnt read the computer dizziness i constantly felt drunk yellow shits with bits in purely from worry and anxiety anxiety makes your digestion super fast stomach ache spasming stomach bloating which was so uncomfortable constant acid reflux a white covered tongue inability to think unable to concentrate completely zoned out like a zombie heart jumps and scares bloodshot eyes chest tightness and pain headaches migraines with aura ear ache ringing in my ear crawling sensation in my ear ulcers like all the time felt weak eg in the gym nausea back pain joint pain jittery jaw involuntary jaw moving swollen lymph nodes numbness and tingling down one side of face as a result of this i had the following tests 1 mri about 30 blood tests diabetes thyroid full blood count you name it ive had it about 5 stool tests 1 ecg 2 emergency hospital rushes 1 xray ears checked multiple times saw an ent specialist twice saw a neurology specialist had an oral cancer screening have a single tonsil up had a mole checked got a lump in my tongue checked definitely had more than this too paid privately for screenings and all sorts im from the uk so healthcare is free ive convinced myself ive had the following illnesses at times ms lymes disease skin cancer oral cancer bowel cancer a stroke brain tumor heart attack etc etc guess how many things i had wrong with me zero i was worried about a few things one was a lump in my tongue which the doctor said was fine and now ive learnt to accept that they are right im still here i still have the lump everything is okay and its the same for you the best things you can do to help yourself are 1 do not fucking google ever i stopped googling about 2 months ago been 100x better ever since has google ever helped you identify a killer disease nope didnt think so 2 try to be rational the best thing you can do if you think something is wrong is tell yourself okay i have found this what is the most likely cause the most likely thing is that it is something benign okay then i will wait for 2 weeks and then go to the doctor 99 times out of 10 it will be gone 3 realise that you have to do this yourself ignore your subconscious mind and take control of your thoughts are you going to honestly let your own brain control how you feel for the rest of your life take the time to take control now its honestly completely in your control take a moment and consider what you are doing there are two people in your head your conscious self if you choose to think something and your unconscious self which is there doing its own thing the unconscious self will make you think things are wrong with you but you need to take control and not let it control you as soon as you let yourself think you have something your body will feel as if you have it it sounds dumb as fuck but you need to choose to be healthy choose that you are okay because by choosing that youre not okay shock youre not okay every single one was manifested by myself cos i allowed myself to get so worked up and stressed 4 look after yourself sleep exercise etc will help i had a vitamin d deficiency which was definitely contributing to my anxiety get a test for that if you dont get much sun almost everyone is deficient in it heck take a low dose regardless the placebo effect might help 5 think about the past how many times have we been though this how many times have you had a deadly infections disease are you dead no why because the average life expectancy is like 80 years old 6 believe your doctor how many times have you seen a doctor how many times were they right but they only looked for one second they must be doing a bad job no theyve just seen whatever youre showing them 39728364 times before they know what good looks like if they were worried they would look for longer these people are medical professionals because they love people including you 7 think about the future would you rather spend the rest of your life no matter how long or short it may be like this youve got shit to go and be successful at and you sure as hell will struggle if you let something consume you like anxiety will its no good being alive but not living go and live 8 dont fucking google just incase you didnt read the first time 9 talk to people more people have anxiety than you think almost everyone above like 25 has been anxious or depressed therapy is good get it if you can but ultimately its up to you to take control and make yourself healthy 10 stop checking stuff poking prodding opening touching all makes things dirty swollen irritated whatever is wrong with you will not go away if you keep fucking touching it apply a rule to yourself like i will leave it alone for 2 weeks and then go to the doctors that will help you to filter things that do and dont matter more easily finally oh and i am not a medical professional and nothing ive written is medical advice you should listen to what your doctor tells you which i am guessing is that you have anxiety which is why youre on here searching for answers you wont find them here nor will you find anything wrong with you go and enjoy your life go socialise make a stand like i said i dont have anxiety anymore i stopped one day and said fuck this im choosing to not have this anymore and its gone its a state of mind and you can control your own brain if tou choose too if you want anything or someone to talk too message me ive not been anxious for at least 2 months now editits now been 6 months since i posted this i consider my ha to be gone now i default to the normal rational thought process that everyone else uses honestly stop googling and start living 3 year update wow where did that time go life has never been better i dont panic about my health i dont obsess or check things i dont google i accept i will one day die i dont stress about it because what will be will be i accept that of the 100s of times i have worried in the past so far 0 of them have been a cause for concern i no longer stress myself out about my health i live its that simple good luck everyone you can take control and move on with your life it really is in your hands no one will do it for you,pre-pandemic
weed sends me into paranoid episodes where i heavily disassociate or think someone is trying to hurt me and no matter how much i assert that ive always had bad experiences with weed people continue to suggest it to me as this like magical cure for all my symptoms someone even told me to stop going to therapy and just smoke instead lol im really glad that it helps some people a lot but its honestly not for everyone edit i see some people misinterpreting my point so ill say again that im not implying that weed or other substances dont help people its just hurtful when people refuse to take no for answer and try to pressure you to do it whether thats through friends or dms im glad some people have good experiences and want other people to as well but its not helpful to nag someone about it if they say no especially when its a stranger,pre-pandemic

as an addict anything good often temporary becomes a vice for example giving up the moment you step back from a stressful situation and decide to walk away the immediate sensation of relief is addictive it may start with more consequential things ending a toxic relationship or quitting a shitty job then it snakes down to those less crucial not attending a party or dismissing an application until finally you give up on going outside getting dressed eating healthy having friends exercising the quality of your life is drowned by the pleasure of allowing yourself to do nothing what started as youprotecting yourself from stressful situations has evolved into giving up on life,pre-pandemic
edit i used to take the blame everything on myself and adhd is not an excuse and a cop out approach in high school but i was beating myself up so much it was to the point where i was having suicidal thoughts because would hate myself so much now i know much more about adhd and the affects it has on people and i began accepting myself a little bit more but i i want to get anywhere i have to hold myself accountable however i am afraid i will end up beating myself up again much like in highschool so im hesitant on how much do i hold myself or probably what is more correct how do i hold myself accountable without beating myself up because i dont want to put myself down over things i cant control,pre-pandemic
i am an incoming 4th year medical student and i make an effort to establish rapport with all of my patients through sympathy and empathy however i have consistently found myself struggling to truly empathize with some of my psychiatric patients especially those with bipolar part of my personality is a strong drive to control my emotions i do not suppress or repress my emotions but i maintain careful control of exactly how i outwardly express what i am feeling because of this part of me it is very difficult for me to empathize with those with bipolar disorder i simply have no frame of reference to understand the inability to control emotion i feel that this is a big deficit in my ability to care for my patients so help me what is it like to have bipolar disorder what can i do to help those with bipolar disorder how should i go about maintaining a professional relationship with someone with bipolar disorder apologies if any of this demonstrates ignorance or prejudice my goal is simply to be a better healthcare provider edit wow thanks for all of the responses i dont have time to reply to everyone but i am reading everything very insightful i appreciate you all sharing your different perspectives,pre-pandemic

yesterday i went to a performance of handels messiah multiple times during the performance it took every ounce of control i had not to just start sobbing because it was just so fucking beautiful and i was so full of joy i thought i might fly apart often we struggle with painful and negative emotional extremes but we can also feel happiness to a degree that would take a lot of drugs for most people wishing you all some beauty and joy,pre-pandemic
i dropped out of high school at 17 due to consistent and debilitating panic attacks and thought i would never be able to go back after two years in an academic upgrading course i am finally able to apply to college with a 90 average feeling so fucking proud dont give up ever,pre-pandemic
i told a coworker a few weeks ago that i had a doctors appointment and he asked why i couldnt think of a lie in time so i just told him because i have ptsd which was the truth his response was you were in the service i said no my dad was a piece of shit to which he just said oh yeah me too and we stopped talking about it pretty shortly after that im not really angry about it or anything just bored enough to complain about it but i hate how everyone assumes that if you have ptsd you must have served in the military just weird to me that nobody thinks of all the other possibilities,pre-pandemic
skinny was and still is clearly the hype for years however curvier women are being more appreciated now which dont get me wrong is great but in a way its not different at all people say they like thick women but what they really mean is tiny waist and skinny everything except for boobs and butt this body ideal is even harder to achieve in my opinion because you cant get it through just dieting its arguable that no amount of exercise can help you get it either its mostly just good genetics then with an actual thick girl shell be called fat and be told to lose weight its ridiculous and a skinny girl will be called flat and told to eat a burger its exhausting that body standards dont cater to majority of the population and most likely never will,pre-pandemic
today a colleague was talking about how lithium the thing used in batteries and other stuff was also being used to medicate people with mental problems that those people would end up with scrambled brains at first i was incredibly embarrassed and upset however i decided that i needed to say something im reasonably close with the other colleagues present although they dont know about my bp they know ive had depression etc i told this individual that i take lithium and i suffered from depression and ocd as a teenager he asked me if i was worried about taking something they use in batteries and i explained that there are many chemicals that are broadly used and that taking lithium helps me to be the best version of myself everyone was kind of awkward and i told them that it wasnt something to worry about and that mental health issues need to be discussed openly the colleague later came and apologized incase they had offended me my point is dont feel ashamed because you are taking your medication be proud because you are working your ass off,pre-pandemic
okay so im currently 17 and my autistic 14 yo brother wont do anything for himself my mom expects me and my dad me and my brother moved in with my dad last november to do everything for him i need to wake him up make him brush his teeth make him have a shower and do his dishes my dad also has to make his bed do his laundry take time off work everyday to pick him up fast food because he wont make himself anything all day he will just eat potato chips and my dad has to prepare special meals for him which he usually wastes the whole thing to on top of all that he makes a fuss about everything and is just very nastybratty to everyone like every time i have to make him do something he yells at me and throws a temper tantrum i cant even look at him or talk to him or he gets very nasty and yells at me dont look at me there has been times were he has not even wanted me in the same room as him its like he hates my guts or something for no reason like ive not had a proper conversation with him in at least 5 months despite me being home a lot but still busy because i did online schooling all he dose now since hes on summer vacation is sit in his dark musty room play video games while eating chips and drinking soda all day honestly it looks more like laziness to me then anything since my mom babied him his whole life i mean literally waited on him hand and foot since shes a stay at home mom she never enforced him to do anything like everything was a option even things like brushing his teeth because he would throw these huge temper tantrums so she just gave in i mean he still cant talk right despite having speech therapy his whole life and was literally still shitting his pants at 12 i mean come on but she doesnt understand that we have lifes we cant constantly be adjusting are schedules and catering to him for everything like she did my dad works full time monday to friday and im going to college in september but im currently volunteering doing side jobs going to classes for my hobbies going to the gym hanging out with friends etc on top of that i do my own laundry my own dishes make my own bed make my own food take care of pet maintenance for are many pets water all the plants clean the house etc i dont know what to do here its like if everyone stopped doing everything for him he would rather just waste away then get up and do anything,pre-pandemic
hey there just wanted to pass by and remind you guys of a few things exercising will make your heart rate go up its normal climbing stairs having sex walking even standing up in a bus can make you feel tired and give you muscle pain if you arent used to exercise dont stop exercising because of those symptoms youre supposed to feel them at first and its more natural to the body if you exercise than if you dont unless you have a debilitating disease which is rare and still can exercise with medical monitoring headaches can be caused by lack of sleep too much sleep not drinking enough water clenching your teeth alcohol too much noise or bright lights and anxiety speaking of anxiety it can give you so many symptoms there are lists on the internet to check them but since googling is not very nice for people here ill give you some rapid heartbeats cold on body extremities palpitation trembling hands dizziness sensation of tingling or numbness wish to cry or run away twitching stomach pains diarrhea or constipation bloating restless legs the list goes on if you took a vaccine and your arm feels warm and kind of swollen thats a normal reaction feeling some cold symptoms too also some vaccines last for 10 years so if youve taken the tetanus one for example five years ago dont worry about tetanus its not that easy to catch hiv you dont catch it by oral sex you dont catch it by wearing condoms if you take a lot of tests afterwards on the right time and they come all negative you dont have it those kind of tests are more reliable than symptoms tetanus doesnt just come from rusty things youd have to get a really deep cut to get it brain eating bacteria is extremely rare and wont be on your tap water throwing up is a natural response and means your body is fighting something bad dont force yourself to stop it you need to be penetrated without a protection to get pregnant periods can be irregular some paint or fume wont give you problems or kill you cats and dogs who have their vaccines and anti fungicide and live inside houses wont give you anything scratches hurt and theyre supposed to get a bit swollen afterwards after getting a cold or the flu you will feel tired your body was combating something you are supposed to feel a bit tired afterwards just remember to keep yourself hydrated to rest and eat something simple your body isnt perfect and our diets arent either sometimes your poop will be different medicine recovering from an infection different foods stress and lack of water can change the shape and color of it just remember to eat as well as possible because your intestine is your second brain as in it will help you combat against anxiety or depression you cant control someone elses life im sorry but as much as you worry about them you cant watch them every minute of their day it wont stop them from getting hurt or sick the best way to deal with anxiety for others is simply helping them emotionally as much as they need and go to therapy yourself google will give you terrible diseases for your symptoms because it has to and it wants you to keep searching for things trust doctors trust the data some diseases mainly neurological are extremely rare and googling it wont solve anything everytime you feel the need to be reassured try instead helping someone here by replying to some posts going for a walk focusing on things you see around you or talk to someone anything other than health issues also try avoiding sugary drinks and if your birth control pills arent workinggiving you bad symptoms for a while go to a gynecologist to change them by washing your hands cleaning your vegetables eating well having good hygiene exercising going to the ophthalmologist once a year or once every two years having protected sex and sleeping well you will be avoiding most sickness you can seriously youre doing way more than most people in the world and even without those people live a lot so will you so remember you can be afraid of getting hit by a car and look at both sides to cross the street to avoid it but dont be so afraid that it stops you from crossing it at all connect with your family talk to your friends try to look out for therapy party study but please dont let ha eat you alive dont stop doing things because youre afraid of getting sick do whatever you can to escape it as hard as it is and remember progress isnt linear and thats okay youll all be fine and sorry for any mistakes english is not my first language,pre-pandemic
i know it will be awkward bad hell but at least everyone can share something,pre-pandemic
i often fantasize about fainting in public and all the people who would rush to my aid i also imagine people eg my therapist a guy i just met one hour ago a former boss exbf etc seeing it happen and being concerned a few nights ago i had a dream about fainting on the side of the road and hoping while blacked out that someone would come over and try to help me when no one did i tried to prolong the fainting spell as long as possible and kept hoping i wouldnt become fully conscious again before someone had seen me and come over i think this fantasy is about wanting others to see my pain and care and about not wanting to be alone i often have it when i am in a situation i want to escape anyone else,pre-pandemic
i think a lot of people dont know that many people with bipolar experience seasonal affective disorder in the spring its not just depression in the fallwinter every year i get manic in the spring after the time change then it spirals into ultra ultra rapid cycling with some dangerously low dips into suicidal depression its a turbulent time my least favorite of the year although the highs feel goodin the moment just wanted to say best wishes to anyone else whos about to go through this and ask if anyone has any advice on how to buckle up and hold on for the ride,pre-pandemic

ive been there i thought that i might see something that will ease my mind but you all know how it goes it makes it all worse and worse out of the 100 times i checked a symptom online only 10 of them kinda made me feel safe all the others made shit worse and worse its better if you just call your doctor and ask him or even better go there to check it rather than passing through the stage of complete panic an internet symptom article would give you we all know that even a slight headache might have some kind of scientific article that makes it look like the possibilities of it being cancer are high or smth like that,pre-pandemic

i saw a post on one of the advice subs idr which one basically this guy was having sex with his girlfriend and she asked him if he wanted to watch her have sex with his friends my brain went hey that sounds familiar give me a second while i dig into that then i suddenly remembered my extremely abusive hypersexual ex i think it was the same week maybe even the same session its all a blur where he took the condom off and proceeded to fuck me despite me screaming no and pushing on him and crying before all that he had asked me something about him watching me have sex with guy friends he brought up a specific friend daniel i told him i was uncomfortable with it and i didnt want to do it or think about it later he proceeded to describe it in detail while we were having sex once just thrusting that image of my platonic friend fucking me while he watched i wasnt able to look daniel in the eyes for weeks i got paranoid of every moment around him eventually we got back to normal were not even that close anymore but i hate what my ex did to me and that friendship you know i saw on social media that that ex had wrecked his car i saw the pictures before i read the text and i found myself disappointed when they said he had walked away without a scratch fuck him fucking die for all the shit you did to me for the bruises and the pain and the coercion again and again for the gaslighting and the suicide threats and the rape for taking pictures of me without my consent for fucking existing,pre-pandemic

life is all about how you act i know that everyone is winging it no one knows what the actual fuck is going on you just got to act like you know what you are doing the point i am trying to make is that this is what adder need to realize is that life is a game and we are all playing an act in the movie called life we need to improvise be confident and have fun doing it the wonder of our brains is that the impulsiveness thinking outside the box and ability to hyper focus is what makes us great actors our movie can be one that everyone would want to watch remember our brains can help our lives either be a curse or a blessing choose which path to take and remember whatever happenshappens just remember how to act always take action,pre-pandemic

one of the most psychologically damaging things you can tell a child especially a developing child is that they have a disorder theres something wrong with you is what your essentially saying this way you have felt your whole life that has been perfectly fine until now that you can not die from is not contagious does not effect iq or socializing skills is a disorder what a sham a lie and no word is responsible for the generations of intellectual belittlement more than disorder this is worse in my opinion than a bully who is simply bigger than another student most physical bullies are simply praying on the lower self esteems the best way to create low self images is to tell said person that they have a disorder thus the mental bully assists the physical bully ally oop this is disturbing the persons image of themselves for the rest of their lives getting beat up one time in grade 7 may have sucked disorder convinces people with statistically higher iqs that there stupid for the rest of their lives that is bullying we all on this feed have attention issues or hyperactivity there is nothing wrong with that being and seeing this differently is a gift dont sit still dont fit in to the box ask questions about the things you care about the things you care about are what you will love and what you love is where your attention is perfect,pre-pandemic

not today not yesterday 9 years ago no one knows no one noticed i took a bunch of pills out of various bottles my family had lying around adderal percocet sleeping pills and allergy meds were among them i dont know what else there were more than four bottles it was just whatever i could find i swallowed some of each chasing them with a wine cooler let a few dissolve on my tongue because i liked the sickening feeling they induced i thought that would be enough after a few minutes of nothing happening i swallowed more got dizzy struggled to make it to the couch passed out i was passed out in the living room and my family didnt notice they walked by me and didnt notice i still remember it all vividly and think of it often i had no regrets i wanted to die waking up realizing i was still alive that was the worst feeling ive ever felt it put me in a daze ive felt on pause ever since i often regret not dying i feel like i should be dead i feel like a large part of me did die that day the only reason i didnt immediately try again was fear of not fully dying i knew i couldnt go through that again and didnt have other resources i felt were adequate i dropped out of school shortly after i stopped leaving my house i see all these stories of people living and being ecstatic over it i dont have that life hasnt gotten better i just wanted to tell someone,pre-pandemic
im feeling depressed out of the blue after many days of feeling good i had a good morning its like a switch just flipped and all the sudden im back to being depressed again things can be going well and then bam everything turns to dust i feel down and hopeless without reason and sometimes its the oppositei feel great for no reason in particular it feels like i cant trust my moods i cant control them and cant shake myself out of it not being able to have a say feels hopeless i feel like i dont know what the real me is like anymore i hate this,pre-pandemic
its almost like i feel im from a different planet and of a different species whether it be ppl at my php friends ive met hell even uber drivers who have shared their story to me i see myself and my own experiences so much in theirs whether it be past events present tribulations or future anxieties i feel drawn to hearing out and relating to their suffering this connection for me supercedes things like ethnicity i mean i am a latinoasian mutt anyway so i never really connected with anyone on this level but even if i did i feel like the spread of variation of experiences from my illness is much tighter than something that i find to be so broad and insignificant anyone else feel the same way edit to clarify i dont necessarily mean bipolar ppl who are currently symptomatic in hindsight to how i act i dont even want to be around myself when im like that for me its more about the experiences of the past and trying to recover as opposed to the symptoms themselves which i fucking hate,pre-pandemic
i spent 10 years locked in a violently abusive situation from 1222ish and im just now starting to deal with it unfortunately dealing with it is like pulling out a giant festering splinter and it feels like im taking 15 steps backwards instead of making progress im getting flashbacks of shit i didnt even know i remembered i wake up and feel every single wound inflicted upon me during that decade all at once its taken up such a huge chunk of my life im 25 now that i feel like i dont know who i am without the trauma its like my core has been hollowed out to make room for all of it and as its emptying i dont know what to put there instead i have no idea who i am i dont even know what i like and what i dont like i dont know what kind of person i am at my core and that terrifies me i hate feeling like this but i have no idea how to even begin helping that has anyone else felt like this,pre-pandemic

i just wanted to take a moment to remind you how amazing the human body is lets think about our ancestors lets think about the harsh conditions weather starvation injury lack of medicine lack of clean water that the cavemen endured lets think about these same harsh conditions that millions of humans still endure today in undeveloped nations lets think about the incredible survival stories weve all heard someone surviving in the wilderness for years someone surviving a horrible animal attack or car accident or plane crash someone overcoming a terminal illness when we sit around in our clean tidy organized firstworld countries its easy to forget what generations upon generations of humans have gone through to get us to this point the human body has adapted and evolved to be able to survive some of the harshest conditions on this planet extreme heat extreme cold starvation dehydration infection broken bones open wounds it is an incredibly intelligent machine with hundreds of builtin mechanisms to coursecorrect if something is thrown offbalance and most of us have such advantages today as access to clean water consistent food and medical care which havent been readily available for the majority of human existence so no that paper cut isnt going to give you sepsis that drop of blood on the toilet paper isnt going to be your end that headache isnt a tumor or a stroke or an aneurysm a bout of food poisoning isnt going to kill you breathing in some smoke or fumes isnt going to cause permanent damage a fast heart rate isnt a heart attack that acid reflux isnt esophageal cancer it starts to sound silly the more you think about it next time you are worried about a symptom remember just how strong you really are remember how much the human body can survive remember that you are equipped with the same incredible biological machinery as generations before you who endured far worse than you ever will,pre-pandemic
my therapist once told me that when i talk about my trauma it sounds like when youre in class and youre reading a book out loud there is no emotion in your voice its completely monotone and sounds like you are talking about someone else does anyone else have this too emotionless when talking or thinking about trauma to me it almost seems like im outside my body watching it happen and i cant feel anything at all or maybe im just crazy,pre-pandemic

sometimes i get a good day where i feel like i have a lot of clarity i figure its worth trying to share with others here are some reminders even doctors have to go to doctors because self diagnosis is incredibly unreliable the times that people have died from undiagnosed silent conditions is far far far less than the amount of times that those conditions were present enough to cause concern in the patient and get it fixed or treated our bodies are incredible alarm systems the symptoms of dehydration and lack of food are very very very real and are often very similar to a lot of the scarier symptoms of more serious things think about it even if youre a little hungry or dehydrated your body is going to want you to know its going to cause nondangerous symptoms it really really all could be just that especially with how common dehydration is in the modern human everything is a risk factor no i promise im not saying this in a scary way im saying that calling small things risk factors is sort of part of the fearmongering that the internet does when it comes to health stuff the term gets thrown around so easily about such small normal things that its basically not worth considering most of the time if youre anything like me then you probably live a very sedentary life just remember that when you are sitting around doing nothing your mind has all that free space to fill with health anxiety and cause fake symptoms you can reliably assume that you are taking your symptoms too seriously and scaring yourself too much on a normal basis if you have gone to the length to be subscribed to this subreddit and be reading this post right now everyone has weird symptoms everyone all the time anything you can think of my dad lived with chest pain for years and years when he was in his 20s and hes now 61 and entirely healthy the average lifespan is the average for a reason if you are under that age especially if you are very young the odds are intrinsically in your favor remember occams razor also that age is continuing to go up,pre-pandemic

hey everyone first time posting on this sub i stumbled across it today and want to give any encouragement or hopefulness to anyone who is struggling with addiction long story short i was addicted to hydrocodone xanax and cocaine throughout high school and was arrested a week before my 18th birthday which saved me some serious jail time ive been sober now for 8 years next month have a wonderful wife 14 month old and we recently learned were expecting another child i just started my mba and seriously i still struggle with my demons but life is so much better than i could have imagined possible while i was in active addiction my advice or takeaway from my addiction is to ask yourself if youre trying to cover something up for me it was intense anxiety and depression i still struggle with that to this day but believe me there are far better ways to deal with these issues than masking them i workout daily meditate 30 minutes daily and go to therapy best of luck and blessing to anyone struggling feel free to reach out if you have any questions,pre-pandemic

the opposite of addiction is connection the addiction is not about the pleasurable effects of substances its the inability to connect with other human beings in a healthy way many say addiction is not a substance disorder it is a social disorder a study had been done on rats that showed when putting a rat in a small cage alone with one bottle of water and one bottle of heroin infused water the rat would choose the heroin water until it killed itself they then put 20 rats in a rat park with other rats wheels toys and lots of other resources they also put a water bottle and a heroin infused water bottle none of the rats chose the heroin infused bottle many of us addicts feel a major loss of connection to other humans as well as to our true higher selves many of us alienate ourselves and lose ourselves while in our addiction pulling us further and further from the people we loved and who loved us as well as far away from the people we were intended to be this leaves us feeling alone broken with no real connection to the world the only connections we have are people who do not hold our best interests at heart we know this if we want to be well we must find true connection again we must find our purpose and surround ourselves with people who align with it people who are there to lift us up so we can lift them up we must do the real work and for once go within ourselves to find ourselves again our truest selves only from within can we heal and regain our lives again we as a society must also realize that we all have a little bit of addiction inside of us it may not be drugs however it may be sex chocolate the gym smoking drama work food shopping relationships coffee gambling our phones or even sugar we are all looking to fill an inner void externally to some extent we will not grow as a society until we realize that not one of us are any better than the other we have more similarities than we have differences and after all we are all after the same things love and peace,pre-pandemic
i spend hours just imagining situation with people im currently attached to and sometimes i make new scenarios sometimes i just imagine like what if i acted differently in a past event it is consuming and wasting my time and it is very distracting i lose my concentration easily to that,pre-pandemic
hey so just like it says in the title ive attempted suicide but failed obviously well i was in a coma for a few days and i wrote a letter for my little sister to explain to her why i did what i did little did i know that letter would be read by everyone and i mean everyone i woke up and a therapist was beside me and the first thing she said was that she read my letter i was so shocked and couldnt say anything for 3 seconds or more apparently she thought i didnt believed her so she just quoted the most disturbing and private part of it to me my mother and all the people in the hospital read it too i had to get into a clinic for one month and no surprise they all knew what i wrote in it i felt so shitty because these was personal stuff i didnt want to share with other people,pre-pandemic
i barely went out with friends when i was in high school always heard about my friends going out to parties but i never went to one myself in university i avoided going out with friends and mostly kept to myself at the time i didnt realize i had anxiety but now when i look back knowing that i had anxiety and depression it makes me really sad that i missed out on socializing and parties even though deep down i feel like i would have felt uncomfortable at them anyways not sure if that makes sense or not its sort of feeling like i wish i could have enjoyed them even though the reality is that i probably wouldnt have enjoyed them much even if i had had the opportunity to socialize more,pre-pandemic
hi everyone this is my first post ever im just going to dive right in i was diagnosed in 2014 when i was about to turn 20 im 25 now so this was a fairly long process the mental health system is shit i was simply told my diagnosis and sent on my way no further input just years on waiting lists i decided fuck it and i decided to develop my own recovery plan i read the list of symptoms and i took a note of them for a whole month i kept a log of my symptoms what symptom occurred what triggered it how did you respond how did affect the other person how did your response affect you how can you respond better next time i noticed i had 3 major symptoms that occurred more frequently than others fear of abandonment unstable relationships unclear sense of self i decided these were the most important symptoms to tackle my fear of abandonment was intense to the point i would physically grab a person and beg them to stay threatening to harm myself it was manipulative but it was a kneejerk reaction i read about the symptom and managed to identify what caused it my dad was unreliable and was in and out of my life like a yoyo for the first 6 years he stayed and never left after that but the damage was done so i had to tackle it i researched about effective communication and planned how i would talk to my dad about how he hurt me and to figure out if i could understand why and let the pain go i wrote a short script and then asked my dad if we could talk it was something like dad i know this is a difficult subject but id like it if we can just clear the air i want to understand why you left me so many times as a young child so we both can move forward i didnt get my answer because he didnt have one himself he didnt understand his own reasons i decided that if i wanted to continue a positive relationship with my dad i had to learn to accept this so i researched acceptance i then wrote in my log every time i struggled to accept something and thought about ways i could come to terms with things i learned acceptance is not the same as forgiveness acceptance means it happened i feel this way i cant change it but i can move forward from it acceptance has nothing to do with forgiving the other person it does have everything to do with holding them accountable after this i decided the only way to get over my fear of abandonment was to physically stop myself whenever i felt that horrid bubbling feeling i sat on my hands i bit my tongue i forced myself to let people leave it was so fucking hard but i had made a promise to myself that i wanted to get better so when they left i turned my phone off i turned my attention to punching my pillows singing my heart out cleaning up anything that prevented me from 1 hurting myself 2 manipulating or guilt tripping another person eventually my fear began to fade away its been two years since my last episode i have finally gotten to the point that if someone threatens to leave me in a petty argument i simply wave and say goodbye then if theyre serious i will offer ways to resolve the issue if that doesnt work i dont beg i just say ok and leave it at that because i had researched communication i began logging about my interactions with others i wanted to see how much i could remember about the conversations i was having with people and what i could remember about the people i was having them with such as what was their kids name their partners name what is their profession did they mention anything interesting you want to know more about combining the research on communication and making myself remember things about another person made the next time we conversed immensely easier and more comfortable this also improved my existing relationships tenfold and i began researching about healthy relationships i noticed that some of my relationships were toxic and draining but i had glossed over them i used my communication research and tried to fix the relationships that were a little battered but most of them faded away naturally as i got stronger because i knew how to toleratebeat my fear of abandonment i was totally ok with what would have usually felt like a massive loss i didnt feel like i lost anything at all my selfesteem began to rise i began to feel more confident and independent eventually all my other symptoms slowly started to fade now i did go to dbt in november 2018 and the techniques i learned in there really just propelled me to the end of my recovery theres also an amazing book the dialectical behaviour therapy skills work book that helps me stay on top of things i was told in june 2019 that i no longer meet the criteria despite that i am rejoining that dbt group in the new year its possible to recover marsha linehan did she says if she can do it anyone can and i believe her i know bpd feels like a hell hole but no matter how clich this is it can get better it was by no means easy and it took me 5 years and hundreds no exaggeration of relapses this is only a snippet of my journey but i hope its a snippet that inspireshelps you on your own journey love,pre-pandemic

long time lurker recently becoming active i love each and every one of you to pieces this sub and the love from all of you posting and responding to each other has kept me on track to recovery better than my therapist im still newly in recovery i think but this has been my longest healthiest bout 36 days now compared to 35 day binge cycles my whole life i wanted to share what i think of as my secret to success just in case it works on a single other person the goal is to focus compmetely on becoming my alter ego skinny cool girl scg is basically my imaginary role model who is me from the future and is essentially me except she is super hot and climbs mountains and is friendly and adventurous and has lots of tattoos and dogs and is buddhist i wasnt doing so well on the hot part body dysmorphia or not im still not sure but damn it i want to be scg so i decided tostart something else scg does besides look good to start rock climbing to get my first tattoo to start hiking to try a kickboxing class to go out with friends i just went skinny dipping no pun intended my next step is to go dancing for the first time im planning a backpacking trip for next summer im going to class so i can get the degree scg has scg doesnt like everything she tries but she tries anything and she doesnt wait for other people to suggest things she thinks of things she wants to do and seeks them out basically i dont want to do those things but scg does and i want to be scg so i go and i have had a great time and maybe im getting a little bit closer to being her what im saying is who will you be when you are your skinny cool girl will you go skydiving will you sing karaoke will you dress in bright bold clothes will you flirt with someone will you eat balanced meals or apply for a better job will you perform or display your art will you go to bed on time what leap will you take someday in order to become her when will she do insert activity here for the first time can you make it happen now take one of the things future scg has about her that you dont have that isnt weight related and go do it in the body you own and operate at this moment the brain your soul who you want to be does not change after you lose weight go be her you have to become her still weight is only a small part of the equation youll catch up to scg dont waste time while you think youre fat not being cool girl or else youll lose the weight and find out that scg doesnt exist yet,pre-pandemic
2016 its close to midnight its dark and cold my door is closed as i lay about to fall asleep i hear something im half awake half asleep so i dont really acknowledge it i turn on my right side and try to fall asleep again but then i hear something i open my eyes too scared to turn back over to see what it is it sounded like someone was crawling beside my bed here i lay trying to figure out what it is then i hear a very loud hey yelled right in my ear i instantly sit up and look around my room but of course i see nothing i must just be paranoid 2005 it was a few months after my mom married him i never really liked him when he did what he did i was too young to understand what it meant hed put me on his lap grab my sides and butt when my mother was working he called me his favorite it was just touching then how i wish it never had to be more 2007 we had just got back from a family party the first time it happened it was really late at night and my mother went to sleep as soon as we got home i remember being half awake as she told him to carry me to bed as i was already sleeping from the car ride home their room was upstairs mine was in the basement as he put me to bed he started touching me by then i was awake he was on top of me and told me to be quiet as he held his hand over my mouth i remember crying and looking out my bedroom window counting in my head thinking of when it was going to be over i was in so much pain when he was done he told me again how i was his favorite i couldnt do anything but cry the next morning my mom was already gone at work and there i was stuck in a house with a monster 2013 it was going on for a few years now yes i did want and try to tell my mom about it but i was so scared she wouldnt love me anymore and would blame me for it happening so i never did because he said if i told she wouldnt want me anymore in school my grades dropped my attendance dropped and id never pay attention i felt so alone and so scared yes i did self harm as i felt that the pain of that would not hurt as much as the pain from him i did run away and when my councilor found out i talked to her i told her an excuse saying i didnt wanna go home because i hated when he yelled i couldnt tell her the real reason was because of what he did to me almost every night i couldnt tell her as much as i wanted to i felt so isolated she called him and he had picked me up from school when we got home he immediately did what he did to me almost every night and said i deserved it for being bad my mom was always out working as she worked two jobs and would really only be home 7am12pm 2015 a few years later and it was still happening i was sick every morning and when i told my friends about it they joked around saying i was pregnant i laughed along but in my head i thought could i really be i remember stealing a pregnancy test from a pharmacy and took it as soon as i got home it was positive i felt sick then and there i wanted to throw up no not from being pregnant but from being pregnant from him my step father i just wanted to die i remember a few days going by as my mom cleaned my room she found the test she yelled at me for not being careful and was yelling at me for becoming pregnant at such a young age little did she know the father was the man she married the man that has been sexually abusing me for years my step father i miscarried at 10 weeks as bad as it may sound i was glad i did 2016 my mom had finally divorced the piece of shit after she found out he was cheating and i had so much relief after that i thought finally no more pain later that year i was constantly getting in trouble doing drugs trying to be cool hanging with the bad kids i was expelled mid freshman year i started going to an alternative school for kids who got expelled from high schools there i met a friend ive known since kindergarten we started hanging out everyday after school i thought to myself that wow someone is actually being nice to me there was this friday where i was hanging out with a different friend when i ran into him and his friends we decided to all hang out and we went in an ally way to drink and he had given me some pills saying it would get me high being the uncaring trying to fit in cool kid i took them and drank my friend i was with had left with some dude that he was hanging with so it was just me him and his other friend we decided to go chill in a stairwell i was so gone off whatever i had taken and from all the drinking i did i remember him asking to have sex and i said no i passed out and next thing i knew he was on top of me as his friend watched i quickly pushed him off put my pants back on and as i ran down the stairway crying i seen him and his friend high five i called my sister for a ride home but didnt tell her what happen when i got home i started crying to my mom but all she did was yell at me for coming home late and didnt even ask me why i was crying i went in my room wondering how could he do that to me someone i knew since elementary school how could this happen as i laid in bed i thought to myself that i was nothing i was already being sexually abused from my step dad for years and now it happens again at age 16 from someone i called a friend by then all i wanted to do was die i thought after that monster was out of my life id be a little okay yet it happened again from someone i knew and considered a friend 2018 i am 18 and i try to drink every weekend i can with older friends because i didnt want to be sober on weekends when i was by myself i didnt want to be alone with my thoughts because on weekdays id be occupied by work so weekends id just drink every chance i could it was not good everywhere i went to drink there was always one dude touching me and pushing his self on me i thought to myself wow i really cant get away from this stuff all my life ive endured so much pain from people i thought were supposed to protect me sure i drank and maybe you think its my fault for putting myself in such a situation like this i couldnt get away from it i thought to myself the best way out of this hell of a loop is taking myself out ive attempted suicide 3 times the past year soon it will be my time to go because all i feel is pain and loneliness im so scarred and paranoid from the things my step father did that every night i have to sleep with ear plugs in and a blanket over my face because im scared that he will be standing next to me even though i know hes gone not the place to post but at the time i just needed it out of my mind and yes cops were eventually involved for everyone asking,pre-pandemic
trigger warning talk of sexual and physical abusethere is no tl dr i need to vent ive never told anyone the entirety of my life i never wrote down how i felt i want to see if it helps x200b i was physically abused by my father i remember one time he slammedpushed the kitchen table into my chest while i was eating dinner it pressed my chair up against the wall then pushed all the air out of my chest i remember getting tunnel vision and hitting the floor limp as the table was pulled away when i tried to get up while on hands and knees i was kicked in my stomach by him i dont remember anything other than being on the couch and my mom leaving him after that with me and my 2 brothers i was 8 this is one story x200b my great grandfather used to call me worthless and emotionally abuse me because of my ethnicity until i was in my 20s i was reminded daily about how worthless i was over something i had no control over he basically stepped in as the father figure i would spend my summers in southern california helping him super his apartments until i was about 17 x200b i have never told anyone this i was also sexual abused x200b i have never told anyone this i was raped x200b to me those are two separate things when the abuse started i physically enjoyed it had no idea then i was brutally sodomized then i grew up just a little and thats when i started to hate distrust and not like anyone i built a fake smile i built an auto pilot response for everyday things i dont think when i can i do what i can to stop x200b from the ages of 9 to about 14 i was fucking raped weekly by a boy 7 years olderwell call the fat ugly rapist fmc i felt like shit because at the start i liked it i didnt know what was happening to me i just felt by the time i was 12 i started to feel disgusted by 14 i fucking hated everyone i dont care to discuss the last time he abused me but i will say i dont think he ever put himself in the position he was in he left me alone at that point by the time i was 18 i was wrapping up making money by taking it from adults to beat the shit out of under age people i went to school with gang related and they didnt want to get in trouble and hell whats the worst that could happen to me if i get caught i was a minor they all deserved this is just how i felt at the time it and it was my only outlet it was shit like kids stealing and the owners wanting revenge cause a family member seen them with the stolen property at school or someones dad wanted me to scare the shit out of the daughters boyfriend shit like like that the last time i did something like this for example some kid who was a senior over 18 at the time had his stereo stolen he gave me 50 to beat the shit out of the kid who did it 16yo he reminded me of the boy who raped me when i punched that kid all i could see was that fat piece of shit fmc when he was on the ground in the fencing position i drug and slammed him around by is hair into the side walk i picked him off the ground while he was dead weight and rubbed his head in the top of a chain link fence i was expelled and arrested for assault i tested out of high school i have never ever been violent with anyone since then all the way till now and im 36 during my time in school seventh through high school i hated everyone fuck em i had only 1 real friend and i had one crush on a girl one it lasted no less than 2 weeks of fantasizing before fmc learned about it he didnt like it he told david my best friend at the time he had no idea fmc was fucking raping me and new him as a friend of my family that i had made out with her he knew david liked her david pissed from hearing this asked christian of course she denied it it never happened it wasnt true i was now known as a liar she went to church and school with me i was 13 at the time so from grade school right on through to high school if i went to church with you or school i was a liar so the one girl ive ever liked now labeled me and to everyone else a liar my best friend no longer because now im a liar this was what happened the first time i ever told another person i had feelings twards someone else one little bitty crush now no social life destroyed home life also behind the scenes is a literal fucking hell i liked girls was being raped by a 300lb fat fucking boy i hated fmc after my last altercation with him i was close to or at 15 about a year goes by no girls look at me small town i dont like them because they hate me i lie about making out with em i wanted to have sex though to be clear i wanted to fuck i had been fucked i wanted to have joy just once so i had a plan when i was around 16 doing the summer super job for my grandfather i paid a prostitute for my first sexual encounter that mattered because i wanted to know what sex was like with a woman when i got back to northern california after the summer job at gramps i told my older brother and he called me a liar i never told him anything personal up until recently because of that now my family thinks im a liar and hates me to x200b so at this point i am 18 and i fucking hate everyone my dad also starts developing a mental disorder he slowly is becoming mentally disabled i figured fuck him some karma x200b i decide to move out my cousin she moves in with me i was growing weed at the time played video games didnt think she and i connected she was the first person i ever felt any affection for she didnt want to use me she didnt want hurt me she wanted to know why i was hurt my head at this point of my life is just so fucked i thinkconfuse that with her romantically liking me i did my best to sleep with her she out of guilt we let me she knew nothing about my past for the most part and we did not grow up together i knew her from the age of 15 then met her again when she was 17 i out of the fucked up need to want to be wanted by the only person i actually had confused feelings for manipulated or talked or we my cousin into an incestuous relationship i wanted to kill myself i kicked her out of the apt she moved in with my older brother and had a sexual relationship with him for about 3 years i felt i was the one that fucked her in the head enough to do that x200b i was going to kill myself x200b my grandmother the great grandfathers daughter had bad arthritis she was a chef so i learned to cook and take care of her i learned that i enjoyed people eating and liking my cooking this was the first time i felt any joy from someone else people my grandmother died when i was around 26 she killed her self the pain was to much i hate saying this but i didnt really care i love her but i didnt care at least she wasnt in pain x200b i felt nothing for anyone for a good period of time no love no hate x200b so until about the age of 27 i got hit on multiple times i am not unattractive i guess i was in 8 physical relationships in my twenties 2 i sorta developed feelings for i never asked any of them out i never once told them i loved them i never lied to them or cheated they asked me out they persude me sex was a chore i love sex in my head i love to masturbate watch a healthy amount of porn but actually having sex ugh i would rather masturbate tbh everything sex reminded me of two things the only person i care for and still love like a sister now my cousin which makes me sick to my stomach because i felt i manipulated her into doing something horrible and being raped in the ass by a big fat piece of shit with porn at least i can choose any nice loving thing that i want i like scenes where you can tell there really into each other and i dont have to think at 28 i was in love for the first time met her at work x200b she started everything i mean everything she broke up with her boyfriend at work asked me out in front of him the next week for 6 months she was in a relationship with me for 6 months i thought we were together for 6 months her and her old boyfriend who she was in a relationship with for more than 5 years at this point used me to further his cuckold fantasy when i found him literally in the closet one night in my fucking apartment that she snuck him into that day at what time i dont fucking know jacking off to me fucking his girlfriend who i thought was with me i flipped out my life is insane wtf is this shit melony thought i was going to kill them i mightve she left both naked with my blanket peeling out of the parking lot i quit that job the next day x200b i want to kill myself have it planned x200b my father develops a bad health issue compounded with his now mental age of around 7 his health his slipping fast x200b i move in with him the state pays for me to take care of him i do nothing but play video games and smoke weed im waiting i tell myself when he dies i go to x200b at 31 i leave the house maybe once a month my older brother decides he wants to reach out cause im a little closed off at the age of 32 he includes me in his hobby at 34 i turned it into what might now be a carrier i still take care of my father i am not so sad anymore x200b im 36 im doing well at the job i can make into a career i met someone another co worker and for the first time no confusion i have a full blown crush as an adult shes nothing special to look at not ugly in any way but my god the personality her choice in music so many things in common thinking about her makes me smile she initiated the flirting we chatted for hours and hours for weeks this did not happen over night she has been there for 7 months at this point and about 2 attached at my hip when she had free time also the subjects she would bring up she was very much flirting so of course i tell her no way can i have any regrets x200b so today i come into work and she makes no eye contact and shuts her office door witch is not normal i ask her if i can talk to her about something later at lunch we get ice cream some times together so i figured that would be the time she just avoided and left me standing there after i asked if we could talk later didnt answer so i asked her at the end of the day told her how i felt and the last thing that i wanted was for her to feel weird at work then she told me she has some one and its complicated i am almost positive she likes another coworker i see them text each other all the time didnt think anything of it till today the thing is yesterday i mentioned i might ask her out the next day joking around when i seen the other co worker in the parking lot the one i think she likes he doesnt work in the building with us hadnt seen or talked to him at all today he laughed when he seen me today at the end of the day when we clocked out pretty sure he told her the day before it made so much sense after i thought about it the way she avoided me x200b she wants nothing to do with me went from conversations her staring at me when she thought i wasnt looking to her actively avoiding me at work in just one day i went from feeling again i went from finally feeling like i can open up to someone i even entertained being normal once i felt again for someone else once more this time it wasnt misplaced i told myself i should have listened to myself when i told me not to even think like that because it wont happen it wont never in my life will i ever find someone that wants me for me not to use me never in my life will i want the person that does i will not be happy all i want for my coworker is to be happy i dont think in any way that anything on both parts was malicious i think its just terrible timing or this is hell x200b i think im done thinking about headed to sleep i will check tomorrow to see what people have to say if anything all i know is i got to feel for once and what i felt was what people do normally i couldnt even once in my life have one thing one fucking thing normal i cant be happy i guess fuck this world update i made it home from work while i was at work i felt comfortable enough to talk a little to a co worker gave him a little perspective and the day was less award than i thought it would be he helped just by listening that being said she still locked herself in her office all day so there was at least not to much awkwardness didnt have lunch with everyone witch is very unusual for me and left a little early so we didnt have to leave together i just want her to feel comfortable at work its not her fault at all also everyone at work knows everyone including both my bosses thought the same as i did about my coworkers interest in me one even asked the girl i liked i guess how long do you think it will take before you two hook up so i guess my mind wasnt playing tricks on me just wish she didnt play games all i know is i cant choose how i feel and i bet shes no different so i am just going to be myself for right now do what i do dont think just do but fuck im still so fucking tired of being nothing feeling nothing at least today i felt like shit i mean that at least is something another thing i will add is my older brother and i have different fathers and my cousin is not a blood relative of his,pre-pandemic

i just realized this very recently about myself in every interaction i have i find it very difficult to separate myself from their mood and behavior if i walk into a room and someone doesnt say hello back to me in a happy tone i assume they are angry at me ignoring me trying to get a reaction from me etc when in reality they might not be paying attention busy working on something might have gotten some bad news that had nothing to do with me are there some strategies that might help me not jump to extreme conclusions that someone hates me from what objectively could be a very a neutral interaction i want to try to be more rational in how i interpret other peoples actions because its caused a lot of problems for me in the past,pre-pandemic
i love food man i love the taste and i love eating and i love cooking i love eating out and going out with friends and i used to look forward to meals because i actually do like food this disorder doesnt change that it just makes me hate myself for loving food and for eating i dont hate food i just hate what i feel like after i eat,pre-pandemic

we all know that the food we eat has a huge impact on the way we feel ive always wanted to be more natural to eat fewer processed foods for my physical health as well as my mental health ive over the last 18 months taken a journey off medication and through a variety of foods to the place where i stand today where am i today i take no medication i have motivation to do the the arduous things in my life i do not wish to do except dealing with my phone bill thank god for direct payments im full of energy that i can always harness ive gone from being an anxious bag of nerves with diagnosed depresion on 30mg of citalopram a day to having a very stable and upbeat mood even when things go wrong i look to the bright side and dont let it beat me who am i a 24 year old male with diagnosed adhd as recently as may i was on 40mg of methylphenidate a day 10mg 4x daily today is 2 months since i took a single pill how does food affect this glad you asked hypothetical adhder consider this food makes you emotional when you havent eaten you get hangry when were really hungry we crave food its all we can think about it distracts us more than anything else many of us are compulsive snackers its pretty clear that there is some relationship between food availability and distraction what have you done about it im about to tell you all the steps in my journey free of charge so that you can understand why some things dont work and why other things do work warning you will not accept my conclusion you will go ahead and try all the steps anyway if youre interested in this method thats fine all i ask is an open mind and that when you commit to each step you fully commit youre only cheating yourself if you dont jump in 100 step 1 processed food is bad for you whether dr barkley says so or otherwise since children those of us in our twenties have been told that eating processed foods is bad for adhd and causes behavioural symptoms whether dr barkley says so or otherwise this diet and advice still holds some traction in several countries i tried eating my usual diet pasta rice potatoes beef chicken some fish bread tomatoes but cutting out ingredients with names i recognised as looking something i found in chemistry class results 1 no changelong story short dr barkley is right i saw absolutely no change worse than that i didnt even see a significant change in my physical health my skin didnt clear up i didnt lose a kg or two from around the middle nothing worst experiment ever step 2 sugar is bad for you keto or paleo or whatever you want to try we are told that eating sugar messes up our brains by causing massive spikes in blood sugar and huge emotional highs followed by enormous depressive lows so i tried eating keto what i was told by the people in my life who tried to sell it to me sugars cause spikes and carbs break down into sugars so avoid eating all carbs and avoid spikes get ripped and stay mentally stable results 2 got fat depressed and literally insane first of all trying to feel full on such energy dense foods as meats and eggs and fish with nolow carbs super hard i smashed through the water all the time trying to fill my stomach still i was overeating and i put on weight 12kg of weight thats 262lbs for you americans what the damn hell secondly depressed i rang samaritans every day for two weeks i was soooo close to ending my life i was working on the final year of a university degree taking huge amounts of meds and still unable to work i was fat my skin got worse my hair started receding not sure why but i think due to the excess hormones in the cheap nasty meat i was eating i developed mouth ulcers and cold sores my skin started peeling off around my nose and eyes my self esteem was not just at rock bottom it was drilling for the centre of the earth i was in a terrible place thirdly literally insane negative emotions flying everywhere you know how when youre hangry you crave sugars or carbs imagine not satisfying that craving for weeks on end people say something and you just fly off the handle youre incredibly touchy about everything especially your appearance and your friends can recognise youre in a hole and so they mention eurgh do not recommend worst experiment ever step 3 and results 3 idgaf feeling like ive tried everything i just ate what i wanted for a while after keto this meant no meat plenty of bread kind of got back to step 1 step 4 cardio everyday ive always been hugely into cardio i really dont enjoy lifting but i love riding my bike seriously riding bikes is cool if you take nothing else from this buyride ayour bike results 4 this is sort of ok lost 8kg of the 12kg i put on in keto skin cleared up a bit started eating just loads and loads of fruit to stay fuelled up during the immensely long bike rides i was going on bananas are fave for this the longer rides i went on the better i felt step 5 vegetarian high carb low fat not sure how many of you know this but one of the most prominent cycling youtubers out there is a guy called durianrider durianrider has diagnosed adhd hes a vegan and his diet has almost zero fat no protein powders and just shit loads of fruit the guy is ripped like noone ive seen before and hes happy everyday but vegan no way man im addicted to cheese and milk and eggs results 5 some self esteem returns adhd is still flying everywhere im not applying to jobs after ive graduated im getting in arguments with my parents but my physical health is never better turns out your body is a herbivorous mainly frugivorous well adapted to eating plenty of plants machine eating carbs gives you fuel all day everyday fruit sugars are nothing like refined sugars the fibre and phytochemicals in fruit prevent it being absorbed quickly it regulates your blood sugar and seeing as your brain runs on blood sugar your brain activity is regulated when you eat fruit hallefuckinglujah im human feeling at last step 6 legendary difficulty vegan ive always been a positive person and i knew exactly how cruel the dairy and eggs industries are they are horrifically cruel when i first found out about it i was shellshocked i didnt move for 5 minutes and i am not a squeamish person i decide to veganism a try fair go i decide to educate myself first and watch this speech by gary yourofsky 1 hr long again for the second time in my life i am rendered literally speechless later in the video i am rendered literally speechless for the third time in my life results 6 motivation selfesteem and a just cause so here i am and ive been vegan for a couple of months i feel great initially i felt more energetic and happier the motivation didnt come immediately however within the first two weeks i had a bit of gas for a few days i was pooping out of control i think this was down to a fundamental change in my gut bacteria as i was no longer consuming any animal products at all there was a significant change once this stopped i was fully adapted to this diet and i felt even better than i did initially and the motivation came as you will see in the above linked video there are serious health benefits to going vegan over going vegetarian the inflammation caused by animal products may exacerbate the symptoms of adhd i dont know i cant find any studies on the subject let alone a conclusive one what i do know is that now i spend my entire day doing things that even 3 months ago were a dream im applying to several jobs a day im exercising because i want to not because i feel like i have to manage myself please note i am not trying to preach my lifestyle to you a large part of being vegan is not wearing wool leather or silks that may be a step too far for you additionally i dont drink alcohol or coffee not because im vegan but because i dont enjoy being intoxicated that may also be a step too far for you personally which is more than fine you do you what i am trying to do is share the positive and negative experiences i have had with my relationship with food and how it has affected my symptoms a plant based diet is inherently healthier if i can get just one of you to seriously try a plant based diet for a month i believe the positive effects will be so great that you will want to stick to it for life and this post will have been worth it i wish you all best of luck,pre-pandemic
the new research indicates that ptsd develops along two separate tracks one involving fear conditioning and intrusive thoughts and one involving symptoms associated with depression those two tracks could be separately identified and treated the team behind the study says based on this evidence its critically important that potential ptsd sufferers are diagnosed and given help as early as possible science alert,pre-pandemic
my psychiatrist told me i need to stop reliving this and did not want to prescribe me anything to help with ptsd symptoms wow thanks im cured,pre-pandemic
im sure most of you have seen a thread earlier today about giving ourselves an ed by downloading apps looking at pro ana blogs searching thinspo thinking i want to have anorexic or maybe if i develop an ed i will lose weight and i get it its heartbreaking how many of us gone through this i have i know thats the way we tend to see it that we intentionally sought this out but did we in my opinion no we didnt because normal neurotypical people dont sit and think yeah im going to get an eating disorder today they dont stumble upon pro ana blogs and think wish i could be like that they find it sad and strange you have a predisposition in the first place eds are more than a way of eating and a body type to worship its trauma psychology socialization body image so much more than downloading tumblr and deciding to fast if you think youre less valid or that youre a wannarexic that you gave yourself this disorder just know that youre not a fake your struggle is real its not your fault,pre-pandemic
im scared of having a debate with any of my friends because im afraid that theyll use that as a reason to not bother with me anymore like theyve been looking for a valid reason to get away from me so theyll take any small argument as a reason to escape every time i get even into the smallest of debates ill always feel like the bad guy even if i didnt cause it or even if im right i hate making people upset so id rather admit im wrong even if im not or apologise just so it pacifies the other person i always visualise fake or past arguments in my head where i say what i actually wanted to say and it makes me feel angry but its also empowering because im saying whats on my mind without the consequences of saying it for real am i just spineless or is this something that others feel,pre-pandemic
long story short i wanted a tasty frozen treat i was gonna get a very low calorie pint of essentially flavorless frozen vegan substance so i went to the frozens section in walmart and lo and fucking behold its fucking locked because of these bastards doing that ice cream licking challenge i had to ask a fucking employee to open the thing up for me so i already feel hella vulnerable cause im interacting with another human being in the context of food and what does this fucker do i get my low calorie depression pint and this fucker rolls his eyes and says of course before locking the thing back i had to forgo all of the rest of my grocery list and check out immediately so i could get to my car before i started crying so basically if any of you fuckers do that lick the ice cream and put it back in the freezer challenge im going to come to your house and kick your ass,pre-pandemic

ive spent the last two days in a hospice room holding the hand of the man i believed was my soulmate for over 5 years he is dying of end stage liver failure he was a good sweet kind man and he adored me in the beginning over time it became apparent that he had been covering up his lifetime of alcoholism and he deteriorated when i say he was an alcoholic i dont mean he drank a lot occasionally through multiple hospitalizations and one stint in rehab i found that he had been secretly drinking a fifth of vodka a day for years he hid his stumbling and slurring through jokes his deteriorating digestive symptoms through claiming to have a new virus every couple of weeks he argued and lied and he denied denied denied he slept through the days and drank secretly through the nights even when confronted with a dozen empty bottles and a dozen water bottles filled with his dark brown urine he could only say he was sorry he knew he was sick but he said he couldnt stop when his behavior became mean defensive and demented at times i ended our relationship over a year ago we have remained best friends texting every night and ive tried over and over to convince him to stop drinking hes always claimed he quit ten days ago he was hospitalized and he called to say he loved me seven days ago he texted me lovingly joking for the last time three days later his brother texted six months tops and there could be no further treatment he could go home to his mothers and stay there for palliative care to live out his remaining days and three days ago the hospital sent him to hospice instead he is no longer conscious he is in pain his mother asked me to visit i drove an hour and a half to the hospice yesterday he had not even moved in a couple days and he never stirred the whole time i was there i went again today and though he was still unconscious he rolled over to me to nuzzle my hand as i stroked his face and scratched his head talking about all the good times and his loving family who were all there he tried repeatedly to sit up eyes still closed unable to speak and as i held his hand he stuck his arm straight up apparently trying to pull me closer to him he nodded each time i told him i love him so i know he knows i was there i am just heartbroken i will go back tomorrow and hug him until the end love the man hate the disease,pre-pandemic

this is going to sound harsh and i know a lot of men on here will be offended even if it doesnt apply to them if you mention that you are a woman on here or any sub for that matter be ready to be flooded by guys offering you to talk just to be there for you ofc but make no mistake a sad majority of them just want to see your picture and get their rocks off theyll feign interest in your pain and say they relate to you but theyll find a way to turn things sexual i have experienced this over and over on reddit without fail and this sub seems to be a breeding ground for guys looking for lonely women to prey on i may be lonely and a bit depressed but i know predatory behavior when i see it so this will probably be the last post i make on here,pre-pandemic
i havent had an advent calendar in years and the thought of one scares me i was not expecting one at all until this turned up in the mail today my mum knows about my ed and this is the most perfect advent calendar i could ever wish for what makes it more special is that my mum was diagnosed with breast cancer a few weeks ago and her life is currently so taken over by biopsies mris and injections plus looking after my grandad with alzheimers which is probably why this was sent so early shes planning christmas stuff before the chemo starts shes just the most thoughtful and kind person ever even when she has so much going on in her own life shes always thinking of others im a bit overwhelmed by this gesture and wanted to share with people who might appreciate it too 3,pre-pandemic

5 years ago i was in a very very bad place i was grossly overweight depressed drinking to blackout alone most days quitting was horrible the first year wasnt all that great but things slowly improved over time im not trying to brag about my 5 years or anything im just taking a moment to reflect on how shit things were at the end of my drinking and how much better a sober life is for anyone struggling i wish you all the very best quitting and staying quit is hard but will probably be the best thing you will ever do for yourself,pre-pandemic
posting from this account because i dont really use it about a year ago i wrote about how i had stopped drinking after getting acute pancreatitis im very young i wrote about my detox experience in the hospital and i received a lot of positive feedback about being sober though it was only for two weeks post my hospital experience i felt really good about myself for a long timeand then i didnt i dont know what happened or why i fell into a downward spiral but i picked up drinking again i told myself it would just be one or two drinks and then i would stop but one or two so quickly became 5 or 6 and then 5 or 6 became every day again i felt like i couldnt stop and i was so ashamed to ask anyone for help because they knew how it difficult it had been the first time and would never have thought id do it again i never thought id end up in the same place again and then in two weeks after that i was in the hospital diagnosis severe acute pancreatitis and then kidney failure and liver failure i was dying and i was detoxing yet again while dying and all i could think of was how stupid i had been how i thought i could have control and limit myself and now here i was dying of pancreatitis and organ failure at 22 because i thought i was smarter than my addiction i think a lot of people think that that theyre smarter i know now that i cant be i dont remember a lot of it i was in the hospital for 34 days and all of it was on a double dose of dilaudid which is 10x stronger than morphine for 19 days i wasnt allowed to drink water or eat anything i had shakes i had nightmares when i could sleep and hallucinations when i couldnt my heart rate was so high from detoxing and organ failure that i was put in the cardiac ward with someone checking in on me every so often to make sure i didnt croak at first all my family visited me then slowly they all stopped visiting until it was only my mom who would come during the day she would sit and cry leave and come back the next day to do the same thing i hated them for it at the time but i understood much later that it was easier for them to accept i was dying when they didnt have to look me in the eyes most of my experience was so hazy because of the pain meds i felt worthless and empty and just wanted it to be over with physically my body had given up on me and mentally i had given up about 17 days in i was tired but i couldnt sleep it was like being stuck in a fog with no lighthouse in sight i just wanted it all to end to finally die and let the tiredness take over in a different way and then it happened in some respect i still have trouble understanding it for a brief moment the fog had lifted and i heard a mans voice in my head telling me that i was going to be safe and it was time for me to fall asleep i knew what it meant because the feeling i had was like i was falling asleep but i knew i wasnt going to sleep it was borderline euphoric and all i wanted to do was grab hold of that feeling and let it wash me away but then a nurse came in it was the end of her shift she had said she wanted to know how i was feeling i told her the voice id heard in my head said its okay to fall asleep now and i was ready she asked me if i felt afraid or scared i said no i didnt have an ounce of fear in my body though if i were to think about dying now im terrified in all capacities i wasnt then i would later find out that she wouldnt have believed me if i was afraid guess it wasnt the first time shes heard something like it she sat beside my bed and started telling my stories from her shift trying to get me to laugh played rock paper scissors showed me pictures of her dog on her phone it took me a while to realize what she was even doing she wasnt making sure i wasnt alone in my last moments she was making sure i didnt fall asleep she stayed by my side for 8 hours past her shift well into the morning did everything possible to keep me awake rubbed my arms roughly or tickled my feet whenever my eyes got heavy specialists oncall finally started coming around in the morning poking and prodding me and the urge to fall asleep in that same way i had briefly felt had dissipated some level of fear had come back and i didnt want to die anymore i was terrified of it again for some reason after that day i began to improve my pancreatic enzymes went down my liver enzymes started cruising to a healthier level my kidneys started functioning better in the end i left the hospital with half a pancreas but i left with something else too some sort of new motivation to give back in life i finished college i got a job i started volunteering and giving back ive never looked at things the same way since then i feel calmer and dont have mood swings like i used to occasionally i feel the urge to drink but it dissipates as time goes on because i know that i cant fully control my addiction but i can prevent it from controlling me i still dont know who that nurse was maybe she wasnt even real sometimes i think it was god giving me one last chance but i think that without her i would have died that night it took me a long time to even talk about this to admit that i felt i had not only failed myself in sobriety but my friends and family too i struggled for so long to tell myself that i was an addict that this wasnt taboo its just college a lot of people said to me its normal to drink a lot but its not normal and its not just college young people can get addicted too and its so far from okay its so far from okay to normalize the behavior in young adults just because they are young its been a year now i havent had a single sip of alcohol and even as i type this i feel like im questioning myself if itll actually help someone but maybe it will young or old to know that they arent alone and that there are consequences for our actions maybe that there really is something out there for us beyond life that watches over us and helps us cross bridges that we dont think we can overcome i crossed a barrier that i never thought i could get past never thought i would ever be able to conquer i havent looked back x200b x200b x200b to add a short blurb to everyone reading this if you need help please get it trust me i know how hard it is to seek it but there are online platforms phone calls counselors aa meetings you name it i made the mistake of never trying to get help because like many other people i felt that i could deal with it myself or often told myself it wasnt as bad as it actually was talk to someone anyone it helps its one of the most difficult first steps to take towards getting sober but it is so so not worth the pain anxiety depression and embarrassment that i felt trying to hide it,pre-pandemic
im a 22 year old guy and my anxiety was horrible a year ago i was unemployed my life ruled by anxiety i couldnt drive go out with friends see a movie and for a while didnt leave my room it got so bad i was severely underweight and stayed in a psych hospital for a few days i began to see a therapist who did cbt 3 times a week plus saw a psychiatrist and got on the right medication now i work in a big hospital operating room as a technician full time i drive all the time go on dates and i start school to be an emt monday today i was assisting during a gastric bypass i was fully scrubbed in holding a camera where i have to be dead still and its just me and the 2 doctors all crammed around this patient it wasnt the first time i assisted during this surgery but it was my first time with this doctor whos notoriously vicious and at one point shit started to hit the fan the room got silent tensions where high and my anxiety skyrocketed my mask started to fog up and i was sweating but i cant touch my face and contaminate my gloves so i was literally trapped then i remembered everything i had learned i started to focus on my breathing and the work the doctor was doing i thought to myself encouraging thoughts and within a minute my anxiety dropped back down and we ended up completing the surgery the best part the doctor told me i did a great job something even the nurses had rarely ever heard him say to someone the point of this post to look at where i was a year ago basically bedridden from anxiety now i live a very full life and do things that i want to not that my anxiety lets me do you can improve and get your life back if i did it any of you can do it the biggest advice i can give is please get help i was terrified but it saved my life i still go to therapy once a month and im still on my medications and there is absolutely no shame in that i hope this post maybe inspired even one of you dealing with anxiety has been the hardest thing ive ever done and i failed at times but didnt stop trying no one has to live like this and no one has to do it alone i wish everyone here the absolute best of luck conquering your inner demons and i believe in you if anyone has any questions feel free to ask and my pms are always open to help anyone,pre-pandemic

they say once an addict always an addict its true that its part of you but doesnt define what your truth is hi my name is bliss and i was addicted to heroin for 5 years and suboxone for the following 2 years and that is non stop daily use i was not sober a single day for 7 years straight short snysopsis of my history when i was 21 years old i moved far away from home met a bad boy felon who i married within 3 months started using heroin with my husband daily for 5 years the relationship was abusive and he had a lot of psychological and health prpblems i lived in tons of shitty places and had tons of jobs that i got fired for either stealing or my drug use i was pregnant 3 times and used through them because i didnt know or didnt care this resulted in 2 miscarriages and 1 preterm son i gave birth to who lived to be a month old before he passed away from sepsis after 5 years we moved back to my parents across the country and within 3 months my husband was out drinking at a buddies house and was playing around with a shotgun played his favorite game of russian roulette but this time when he pulled the trigger he shot himself in the head was pronounced brain dead and died 3 days later i am only putting this out there because a it feels good to talk about it since i do not have many people who know this about me b to let you know that all humans suffer in some way or form and even though this can be seen as traumatic i am still alive i have been sober for 25 years i know it doesnt matter what others say about recovery it doesnt matter to an addicts mind i remember thinking yeah you got sober but you dont know me i just cant do it many think they cant that they are different and their struggles are different the thing is addiction also makes you entitled believing the universe revolves around you and when you suffer the world will come to an end until you feel better this is the problem of thought and once someone feels entitled they feel their way is right that they are the center of the universe its not just addicts that think like this its much of society however we need to suffer we need to feel pain to feel bad to be able to turn it into something we learn from and something we grow from we must try to put the long term high above the short term one when you stub your toe for the first time you feel pain so you know not to go around kicking tables or walk into things you learn and thats a beautiful thing about existence now that i am sober i can feel and smell and see clearly and even though its not all roses it doesnt matter because thats just part of the human existence anyway sans addiction i have had a new wonderful partner for 4 years a great salary job and have positive meaningful friendships none of them care about my past that i was a junkie who put myself through hell and could not be trusted by anyone close to me so i just leave my past there thats the wonderful thing about it it can stay there and you do not have to live it anymore you can find support offered everywhere but the only support that gives you an answer is the one from yourself its a frightening scary step to take but you have to fight against gravity holding you down you just need to pick up one foot and step forward then the next and over time you will be running you will be light humans are amazing creatures just suprise yourself,pre-pandemic

does this happen to anyone else i actually think this sub is a great tool for cathartic sharing among people with anxiety and i know i could derive some benefit in allowing myself to post more but theres some silly irony in me thinking well what if this gets ignored what if people think this is dumb or invalid even right now as i type this i think oh yeah this is so witty and meta this will definitely get me to the top of the sub which is so in line with every obsession i have about being special being great being loved etc and my inability to just do or enjoy the small things for what they are without some greater sense of meaning edit ha this blew up how poetic the joy or validation i feel from the upvotes doesnt match the negativity i would have felt if it went unnoticed which is good to know you all are wonderful and this is a great community ive come a long way with my anxiety and im working on a project to help and give back to those struggling and those who have helped me so i hope to see you all here again,pre-pandemic

there was a guy i met in this sub a really good guy i followed many of his posts and didnt speak to him till i saw his last post in which he described how he felt and announced how he is gonna take his own life its really disheartening how our own mind plays tricks with us to the point where we will lose all our hope dreams and joy in life how it puts us in a loop where everything seems dull and empty this guy was a legend he tried his best but still unable to find strenght to carry on i believe this is the worst way to go i wish i said something more i wish i knew better now there is nothing anyone can do he left thinking worst of himself feeling worthless after many years of struggle please dont mind if its written poorly i had to get this off my chest thanks,pre-pandemic

she called it the rule of 3s basically make a list of safe foods ie foods you general dont binge on and feel safe eating and a list of non safe foods ie foods you tend to binge on or dont feel comfortable eating next make a list of safe places aka places you dont generally binge like a restaurant or in public with your friends and non safe places like your room alone lastly make a list of safe times times youre less likely to binge for me its the morning or afternoon and non safe times times youre more likely to binge for me itd be evening or late at night from now on 23 of those things need to be safe whenever you eat anything not in a safe place if youre going to eat it has to be a safe food and at a safe time not eating a safe food you bet your ass you have to eat it in a safe place and at a safe time as long as 23 are safe challenge yourself with something not safe not only does this encourage eating nonsafe foods in a healthy way it really helps deflect a binge if you stick to it i hope this helps yall as much as its been helping me,pre-pandemic

i recently spoke to my psychiatrist about my bipolar disorder improving with treatment but not my other mental health issues i let him know how embarrassed i was about the ordeal because i sometimes feel ashamed about the number of issues i have he shared with me some statistics that reassured me quite a bit and made me realize im not alone this info helped me find more self acceptance and i thought it might help some of you as well these statistics come from a public 2008 psychiatry study n9282 ill post the full link below as well as the specific chart im getting these figures from in case youd rather dig in yourself heres some of the statistics that stood out to me 92 of people with bd will be deal with another mental disorder 70 of people with bd will deal with with 3 or more other mental disorders 75 of people with bd will be deal an anxiety disorder 63 of people with bd will deal with an impulse control disorder 42 of people with bd will deal with a substance abuse disorder if you ever feel alone because of the multiple issues youre facing just know you arent heres the table where i got these figures from it breaks down the prevalence for specific disorders and categorizes them by bd1 bd2 and subthreshold bd and heres a link to the full study disclaimer i dont have a medical background so please let me know if i misinterpreted anything,pre-pandemic
its like being a narcissist but at the same time being an empath its like being dr jekyll and mr hide but remembering everything being both at once yet sometimes only one at a time i can both love deeply and do horrible things to that person and i feel it all the guilt the desire to do good to the person i love the fear i feel crazy and i guess i am but at what point do you throw your arms in the air and give up say ok you know what im a horrible fuck up and im not worthy of anything good and ill never change so i guess ill stay here,pre-pandemic

so i recently got diagnosed with bpd after getting an initial diagnosis of depression and anxiety a year ago i found this sub and thought id share this here im not sure if this is affiliated with bpd or not but ive noticed its really hard for me to express myself clearly and say what i mean in verbal context ill have something i want to say in my head itll be clear to me but once im actually trying to vocalize these thoughts its just like verbal diarrhoea i dont know if im overthinking this close friends and family have spent so much time with me that i think they understand the points im trying to make but i always feel like im not able to actually accurately communicate how i feel its really frustrating because i hear people speak effectively around me all the time and it just makes me overly conscious about my own speaking abilities which just makes me spiral even more texting has always been my preferred way of communicating cause i feel like writing things down gives me the chance to review what im saying and fine tune it to accurately convey whats going on in my head,pre-pandemic
by that i mean people who are say 25 with a confirmed diagnosis i know there is a lot of value to an open forum but it might be nice to have a group for people who have been living with bipolar for a while or at least are dealing with it as adults just wondering if anybody else feels the same follow up sorry to open this can of worms and then go silent im not feeling great right now so i got a little overwhelmed i think some people have misinterpreted my intent i wasnt proposing a split into an alternative sub and definitely not requiring proof of diagnosis i was just musing that there might be a niche for a community of older people who have gone through the diagnosis phase and are dealing with the challenges of living with bipolar through adulthood i arbitrarily said 25 thinking beyond university age im 41 i think rbipolarreddit is a great community and im absolutely not suggesting that anybody abandon it theres huge value in engaging with people with different experiences and its important that elder bipolars support those who are just trying to figure things out so forum could be an additional sub a weekly thread or something like a telegram chat just testing the waters but it seems as if theres some interest,pre-pandemic
this happens to me a lot and i always talk out my issues to my boyfriend whenever i start feeling like this but theres a lot of times where i just wake up depressed and i dont really know whats wrong like today for example i had a bad dream which isnt uncommon for me but when i first woke up i felt fine then within 1520 minutes i just became sad dont know if this is common for ptsd or maybe im just a bumbling idiot and i dont know what im talking about just sick of waking up in this state and not knowing what to do because i dont know the cause,pre-pandemic

hi reddit i posted my adderall recovery journey 34 months ago and a few users suggested i post it every few months in case others find it useful im going to try to remember to do that so here it is i quit after taking this stuff for 10 years and havent touched it in over 15 months this is all just my experience and others may have a different opinion but for me this is what it took im not here to judge anyone else or say whats rightwrong this is simply my journey i had to go cold turkey i tried quitting many times but cold turkey is all that ever worked everything else is just denial or an excuse i told myself i would taper down or slowly stop or whatever but i just needed to stop and stop making excuses i found reading other peoples journey was helpful when i was trying to quit so heres mine in the event it gives you even an ounce of conviction or strength i took adderall for 10 years 2131 and quit just over a year ago i live in san francisco and have a very demanding fast paced job in tech where i manage a team so that was the part that made me the most nervous but i realized i was picking everything else over my health i got to a point where i needed adderall to be me so was that even me it was so so hard for the first 23 months i was so tired and felt like a zombie but was just gentle as fuck with myself and after the 3 month mark i felt functional around the 56 month mark i felt good actually like a new person never in a trillion years did the old adderall me ever think id be able to be disciplinedproductive without it but here i am happy have normal energy like a normal human just as successful in my job i def underperformed for those 34 months keeping my head above water professionally was the hardest part but treating each day i said no to adderall as a victory was how i got by reading stories on here and quittingadderallcom helped make an account distract yourself by engaging on there exercising first thing in the am before my brain could realize how tired it was i was very hungry so cookingprepping healthy food was key as well fresh whole fruitsveg ltyrosine magnesium fish oil and other vitamins that may or may not have helped but i did like the tradition of taking pills every morning they probably helped theres a lot of info online about different things you can take to help with brain health as you recover i even took pre workout powder with water each am in the beginning to get a little kick whatever it took time sleep clean eating exercisemoving coffee distractionquittingadderallcom supplements thats what did it in that order i also found not eating after 7pm really helped with the morning brain fog my point i remember it very clearly for years the guilt of taking this drug i went through all the normal phases of first discovering it loving the shit out of it everything was suddenly so amazing until it wasnt becoming uber successful professionally and subsequently setting a standard at work thats just not humanely sustainable then slowly realizing that i didnt feel like i used to that maybe i was a bit of a productivity robot i felt i needed adderall to be the talkative fun friend everyone expected me to be creating anxiety that maybe i just needed to accept that i was adderall i needed adderall and then the ok im not addicted ill just have a few a week i dont need to quit full stop maybe just half of one a day or maybe i just stop for a little bit and see how i feel so i should just keep this bottle handy in case it doesnt go well then i listened to that insane dependent mental negotiation i was doing with myself and realized yeeeeep thats an addicts negotiation tactic this is not healthy i always made excuses for needing it a big project a friends bachelorette party an event whatever i even went through the denial phase of this is a medication i have adhd my medical doctor gave me this its medicine oh brother that was the hardest phase because i knew deeeeeep down i was in denial grasping at such an easy excuse for myself this is just my own experience im sharing here to each their own then i realized that i have a very full life so there would always be an excuse was i really so insecure that i didnt think the undrugged me could handle it i then realized i didnt even know me was i willing to live an entire lifetime without ever knowing my authentic self i was so scared i started by committing to one day at a time mini goals and like i said every day was celebrated like a victory just one more day one more week the first 23 months i was a sleeping sittingatdesking eating slowmo exercising machine i felt like i got hit by a truck then it got better then it got ok then it got good then it got great now i feel amazing dont get me wrong i dont feel high i feel like a normal human with normal waves of emotion tiredness energy creativity anger sadness happiness excitement laughter everything normal waves not extreme waves like addy gives you its so good to be alive and get to know me anyone can be someone on adderall and there are very similar traits but theres only one you get to know you the playful you itll take a while to get back that person so be patient and loving with yourself dont think that whoever you meet the first few months is the new you its not it takes a little longer i am also amazed at how capable i am i think back to 78 months ago and i feel like i produce just as much at work im not hyper focused with quick witted things to say in meetings but i get my shit done i get it done well and i feel real i remember the struggle i remember the self doubt i remember the fear i still think of adderall every day and occasionally want it but i mostly think i cant believe i fucking took that capsule full of little toxic beads every single day for 10 years wtf was i thinking which is major progress from what i felt for the first few months i just want one just half of one ill start next week it takes time discipline and self love id say the self love is was kept my drive to stay off of it high ive worked hard on myself throughout my life and deserve to be as healthy as im capable of being i want to have a family some day and they deserve a healthy me as well why rob myself of that im sorry this is so long but the details are important its not easy please feel free to dm me if i can help you got this youre capable and amazing without any drugs get excited to get to know the real you the undrugged pure you,pre-pandemic
i thought i had a good amount of selfawareness about it but it didnt save me this time im already out 100 on purchases i didnt really need and i had no idea it was hypomania at the time im now full on hypomanic and i can finally tell that buzz i got 4 hours of sleep last night and it was all nightmares im hallucinating again the whole deal every time i think i get a grip on this thing it slaps me on the face and says no,pre-pandemic
ive been seeing a lot of posts here lately that really concern me not just as a moderator but as someone who has been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder in addition to bipolar and now that im getting pms and modmail about this exact issue i feel like we need to talk about it i do not think people with bpd or other personality disorders should be made to feel uncomfortable here and when someone posts here claiming their diagnosis is superduperrapidcycling bipolar and their medication isnt working i would not tell them they probably have bpd because what does that mean the saying i like to say about myself is that im the kind of crazy a pill cant fix anyway i saw a couple of people make comments saying that bpd is untreatable that even dbt doesnt do that much as a guy who has tried to employ dbt techniques himself too poor for an actual program i can say that not only has this helped me more than any form of cbt but its helped me tone down my bpd tendencies altogether given that i was destroying nearly every relationship i had i cant help but be grateful for that but the facts remain one bipolar disorder can manifest in many ways and none of us here are professionals capable of providing diagnostic advice two even within a community of people with mental illness the stigma of other less treatable disorders still remains i dont want that on here and im pretty sure the other mods dont either theres a ton more i want to say about this issue but i want to put this up first so i can get you all to chime in and see what direction this goes in im really looking forward to hearing what everyone has to say about this subject since its about time it needs to be addressed,pre-pandemic
that was the text message i sent to my best friend last night manic out of my mind and hallucinating animals everywhere i had convinced myself i was possessed by an evil spirit and having to fight it for control of my mind i had convinced myself of a lot of things by then and my mind was moving way too fast for rational thought then something amazing happened i actually put my safety plan into place took my prescribed dose of trazodone and basically knocked myself out for a while this morning i woke up still hallucinating but not the least bit manic ive even stopped hallucinating as the day has gone on guys this is a victory for me its the first time ive ever been able to think through my safety plan while actually manic and put measures into place to stop it going further i have terrible self esteem and am not typically one to point out accomplishments but i am proud of this no one but those who have been there would understand the depth of it,pre-pandemic

to the sweet old man at the donut shop when you saw me carefully select and buy 8 huge donuts you know like the cinnamon roll and apple fritter type donuts and joked at me you must be hungryif only you knew if only you knew that i had just eaten three pastries at home and rushed over to the closest shopping center from my house breaking the speed limit for these donuts if only you knew that right after i left the shop i would take these donuts to my strategically parked car and eat almost every single one of these by myself and in a single sitting until i was writhing in severe pain so bad that i wouldnt even be able to drive away until my body actually got some time to digest some of the food if only you knew that no i wasnt just hungry i was fucking famished to drown my agony in donuts even despite the fact that i did the same thing last night as well if you knew you probably wouldnt be laughing at your own joke anymore you would probably be mortified at your own words disgusted at the behavior and sympathetic toward me if only you knew but thats okay you didnt know thats why i laughed are your comment too thats why in my eyes youre sweet you probably thought i was taking these donuts to my friends or family talking and laughing in between bites of these pockets of saccharine goodness you probably thought there was no way a 52 girl would ever possibly eat all of these on her own maybe if i were 300 lbs you wouldnt have said such a comment but thats okay because from the outside it doesnt look like im suffering from an eating disorder so theres no way you could possibly know to the sweet old man at the donut shop i hope you enjoy that single donut that you purchased yourself and remember me as the girl who laughed at your joke and bought donuts to share with others i wouldnt want to burden your day with my issues i want you to remain comfortable enough to continue joking with strangers i dont want you to know edit i cant believe i got so many compliments on my writing i literally whipped this up randomly and quickly as i was waiting for my food to digest a little before i could drive away from the parking lot after that binge and i wasnt expecting this kind of response at all i can get a bit insecure about my writing and these comments honestly made me absolutely delighted like maybe im not such a worthless loser lolnowif only i could believe people in the same manner when they actually call me pretty or not fat lmao,pre-pandemic
i go through periods where say ill have a pain in my groin or bollock i got checked at the doctors and nothing wrong sure enough it went away in a couple months or so then i had pains in my arm pits a couple years later and lasted for months got checked and nothing wrong they went away now ive got pain in my upper left stomach and its really worrying me i have cancer or something i went to the doctors and they couldnt see anything wrong had a good feel around and gave me some tablets for heart burn i do get real bad heart burn im hoping this goes away too but does anyone else get this im a nervous wreck right now that im dying because all these pains are somehow linked and ive got cancer and its slowly killing me,pre-pandemic
i have experimented with some psychedelics lsd shrooms some rc like 2cbfly etc i have taken higher doses in many places and i have had wonderful experiences this time it was supossed to be special since my flatmate t had to go a couple of months to the city where her parents live so we wanted a great good bye for her she already tried psychedelics before at least 3 times so she wasnt a newbie we took about 260ug and went to the outdoors sat next to a tree and let it peak it was a really nice spot but a couple with dogs didnt stop walking near us and looking to us and i felt so unconfortable i wanted to go home then i realized we were too high to walk i dont know how we decided to be brave and walk to home i thought that being in a safe place would make me feel better but i was really overwhelmed by everything light was too bright music was too loud and annoying i didnt feel confortable sitting in my couch it was too much and i decided to take rivotril2mg clonazepam a benzo to stop that horrible feeling i felt so alone like i couldnt fit in any group like t and my gf were some strangers t is autistic and she helped me to understand what was wrong with me since that day i finally could understand some problems like talking to new people or some quirks i have i dont have diagnosis yet and im not focused in getting it but i m working in undertanding myself and let me be like i want to be i realized why i always think everything i need to say before picking a call why i feel like everyone is watching me like im the freak or some weirdo why loud sounds scare me so much like everything about how i behave makes sense now i feel like i can understand myself x200b edit im not saying anything negative about autistic community and autism psychedelic trips have helped me with several aspects of my life and this is something about myself that i already suspected it wasnt some random idea in my mind,pre-pandemic
for anyone interested heres my story and a few thoughts on recovery in the last section of my sermon lol april 2014 after 14 months of recovery i relapsed after i steadily stopped going to as many meetings and focused more on work i had convinced myself it was mind over matter and within a week i was back to my old alcoholic way of drinking and it got worse from there back to the old endless thought of i can drink today and stop tomorrow on and on got very sick and really the only thing that gave me a window of opportunity to take action was how fast my tolerance went up how difficult it was to hold down alcohol food water anything and on may 26th somewhere in the midst of an 18 pack of coors of all things i had my last one may 27th 2014 was 5 years ago already and in that time ive turned all my old chips in worked the steps earned them all back and then some while still detoxing about a week after my sobriety date at 31 years of age i started a new journey in school summer session psychology 1 in community college i worked very hard in school i took no short cuts i sat up front and took notes i did well and i stayed sober the summer of year one was a hard one as my dear friend a girl i might have married had things turned out a little different michelle died due to organ failure caused by alcoholism at 36 years old i was able to be by her side that night at the hospital because i was sober may she rest in peace that week following i completed step 12 with my sponsor and i carried on in school a lot has happened since then i got to prove to myself that i wasnt that f student high school drop out anymore over the years to come and i stayed sober a day at a time in that time i earned two associate degrees one even in alcohol and drug studies if you can believe that which i think is hilarious i transferred to my top choice 4 year university and studied there and then i graduated with a bachelors in psychology last year my father was diagnosed with advanced lung cancer from smoking last year not long before i graduated and he got to be there at that ceremony it meant the world to both of us i think and my mom too even my sponsor was there i sat right next to another member of this very fellowship at that commencement we took classes together from community college through university and we both graduated that day summa cum laude not bad for a couple of alcoholics now shes in a masters of marriage and family therapy program at her top choice grad school and im in a master of social work program at my top choice grad school at an internationally recognized tier 1 research university with one year left to go i am pursuing my dreams and a future that i never could have had had i not been an alcoholic and worked the steps of this recovery program i love the life recovery has given me today and i intend to make the most of it i just hope that maybe you or maybe someone new can read my story and find some hope because when i came in i never thought id be a person to take a birthday chip someday actually i thought you were all a bunch of religious weirdos in a cult and thankfully i was wrong and it took me really learning about the program to get it and accept it i wouldnt change anything about my life im grateful for all of it today early recovery is hard and the life that precedes recovery is often so sad its no wonder many of us were willing to consider suicide to escape i have come to believe that we have a potential of sorts a source of energy a kind of growing capacity generated in the void of the emptiness that is life in addiction it is the inverse of recovery like the dark side of the moon but i believe it conceals something very powerful we cannot see it is there all along if we can only reach that fork in the road to access the moment of clarity and take the path that is right there for us my journey since then i swear every door opened and a stone appeared before each step of the of the way on this path for many of us we must reach the end to find a beginning its beautiful and almost sort of hard to believe how these things are true about life but they are thanks to everyone here who has been supportive over these years you are family to me and i love you guys theres no people on earth who have the depth heart and humor of all of you and i plan to stick around for more to come one day at a time,pre-pandemic
i started taking 50 mg of zoloft almost 4 weeks ago now and my life has changed i dont constantly google anymore i havent compulsively checked my pulse in days and i havent had a panic attack in 2 weeks im not gonna lie i felt like shit for the first 10 days i was on it but now it feels like the clouds have lifted and i can finally see the sun again i just wanted to post because this sub helped me get through some really dark times and for a while i was too scared to go on meds because it seemed like some crazy big scary decision to change the way your brain functions but folks on here helped me realize that sometimes you need medication to fix it and that being sick doesnt make you weak or broken so mostly i just wanted to say thank you to everyone on this sub and also say that it really does get better once you get on the right treatment for you stay strong,pre-pandemic
they say this i am adhd so you are attention deficit hyperactivity disorder then okay carry on edit why all the downvotes if youre seriously saying that you are the disorder itself then that means this bob claims that he is sooooo adhd so bob adhd i have adhdc i have bob type c also youre probably talking to someone who thinks adhd is a placeholder for some trivial personality trait like distracted or forgetful and to anyone who thinks it is heres a hint its not edit 2 on a more sentimental note i think i know why you guys are downvoting me is it about how someone with adhd might not be able to tell the difference between themselves and their adhd because their adhd affects them so drastically you know what i get it my adhd has screwed me over time and time again so much so that im starting to believe that its all i have and all i am in my case its led me to believe that im a failure my adhd shapes and has shaped who i am without adhd i wouldnt be me thats never going to change but it doesnt have to remain that way i dont have to be adhd i can be better than that with the proper treatment and support no one has to be adhd but i understand how i could have been misunderstood by some of you guys people say you arent your disorder but asking how adhd has affected my life is like asking how my parents shaped my life i cant point fingers but my parents shaped my life and defined who i am as a person adhd didnt make me who i am but it definitely made me into what i am and how i am a post by ugedalya,pre-pandemic
its so strange in under a year ive come to realize how easy it is to slip out of someones life no matter how much you cared for each other before its comforting to think that these people will be are okay without me so nothing will be selfish about my suicide edit thank you stranger for silver to everyone else who understands this every you matter and you dont realize how much they care actually is very kindhearted of you to say but untrue in my circumstance unfortunately,pre-pandemic
i know part of depression is having a hard time with self care but i think its related to ptsd its a super vulnerable place to be you cant hear or see as well its slippery and youre naked plus its hard to be alone with my thoughts like that all the jokes about fake arguments in the shower and fake scenarios playing out in your head that shit is really real to us when i shower im trying to take care of my body but it just reminds me of what my body has been through does anyone else have this issue what helps you get through it edit to add thank you all so much for your comments im sorry that we all have to experience difficult things but it really helps to know we arent alone were so strong and well get through it all,pre-pandemic
i feel like anytime i get attached to someone i become the most annoying and insufferable person ever to them this causes me to not text or bother them in any way for fear that im annoying them and they probably dont want to hear from me and if i text them they feel obligated to answer me and if they actually wanted to talk to me they would text me first i also think though that im annoying to everyone but i just dont care unless that person is important to me i usually end up talking to the important people less than people who arent as important to me just because the stress and anxiety that im annoying them scares me from even contacting them whereas with the less important ones its not a big deal if im annoying them because who cares if they dont want to talk to me anymore with an fp more is on the line if i start to annoy them idk just some ramblings from me because ive been feeling lately like a joke and a loser and someone who nobody wants to be around because im so fucking irritating and stupid it seems no amount of reassurance from anybody can change how i feel about that,pre-pandemic
when i am sleeping nothing around me exists no duties no burdens no depression nothing i can just live even dreamless sleeps where there is nothing but darkness feels so comfortable i can just close my eyes and leave this world for some moments i am so tired so tired of everything they always say theres light at the end of the tunnel but ive been running and running with no end in sight no relief in sight im just endlessly running while wearing a mask of a sane man,pre-pandemic
like do you really think that im actively avoiding a relationship no you have no idea how badly i want to be in a relationship to find someone who cares about me as much as i care about them who wants to be with me as much as i want to be with them but sadly no one wants to be with me no matter how much i show them i care they dont i see everyone around me getting married and having kids and finding love and yet i have more love to give than anyone and im alone i just dont get it people ask me all the time why i am single often times i ask the same question to myself if i knew the answer the question would never have to be asked in the first place,pre-pandemic

overheard coworkers talking yesterday about anxietydepression screenings how prevalent they were with routine health checkups and the number of questions asked it was weird to hear how incredulous they sounded and im over in my cubicle thinking if only you knew how much some people tried to avoid those questions and act normal despite of things then you might understand the reason behind all the questions my childhood was so messed up that its odd thinking about people being able to go through normal life without being plagued with anxietyintrusive memoriesmentally freezing up,pre-pandemic
do it just take a second to look through this sub and look at all the people struggling to find a reason to live some people are fighting their hardest against impossible odds some people never had a chance some are nihilistic and dont see any reason to live and some like me have hereditary depression and who cares genuinely who cares ive come on here just to rant and id bet any amount of money you whos reading this did the exact same everyone is self absorbed the only people who care about you if any cant help they have their own lives to live they beg people with depression and who are suicidal to talk well who do we fucking talk to i dont have the money for a fancy fucking therapist i honestly dont just feel sorry for myself right now i feel sorry for mankind do you think in a tribe if someone is crying they walk past them and pretend they didnt see them for whatever reason this 21st century though being the safest and most peaceful time in all of history is also some on the most uncaring sociopathic fucked up times in history well maybe not maybe the world has always been fucked and we just have selective memory noone cares about you noone cares about me i wish i could look out the window and see a fucking meteorite screeching towards earth im done i really dont know how i am going to get through christmas this year so i might as well leave a trail so my family dont blame themselves if i do something i doubt i will im a pussy and too scared so ill just sit in my misery watch another year come and wonder how i will survive this new year coming,pre-pandemic
if you want to recognise an occasion please do so by offering extra support to those whove asked for it and by being a good citizen of the community mindful of our tips and guidelines edit in response to multiple requests im adding a definition of activism here campaigning to bring about political or social change thats straight out of the oed we arent making any special interpretation of it any post that is primarily about raising awareness or changing perceptions is activism according to the dictionary definition and thus a violation of the community rules some examples of the most common types of activists posts we were here all of which are totally inappropriate advocating for changes in laws around suicide advocating for change in the mentalhealth system advocating for changes in cultural norms or common perceptions around mentalhealth these are often related to specific days devoted to specific causes eg world suicide prevention day keep in mind that our mission here is individual peer support any post thats not a request for personal support regarding current experience related to suicide is probably a rule violation unless it has the mod approved flair,pre-pandemic

i was on a date today with a girl ive been seeing for a while and i finally opened up to her about my ptsd and she said she didnt knew i served in the military i didnt i told her that she immediately became more cold and even called me a pussy and sick because im ridiculing others that actually have ptsd and have been traumatized by blaming all my petty problems to fake ptsd she emasculates me for saying that i have ptsd when i dont because evidently im not strong or man enough to deal with problems normally sorry my parents fucking beat me for the first 18 years of my life now shes left me and im just typing this out of anger and frustration because im sitting here not able to sleep because i know ill get more night terrors if i do let myself sleep and i just cant handle them anymore i hate this thanks for reading whoever did just wanted to vent yall edit didnt expect to get this many upvotes i was just venting yall lol thanks for all the kind words the encouragement to move on and realize that i dodged a bullet and the hope that ill find someone wholl have the proper compassion to accept me how i should,pre-pandemic

i lost a really deep friendshiprelationship six months back back around early january they used to mean the world to me and ive seen them go down such a rabbit hole of bad choices ever since they left theyve gotten worse over this time i worry about them still but theyve made it clear they dont want anything to do with me i miss their touch the comfort i get from merely being in their presence i miss their companionship the thing is i want to fall in love again i want it so fucking badly but theres nobody else thats a good match even more so i dont have the time for such an adventure at this point in lifeim a teen im busy as hell for the next year but i miss human contact so much im not looking for sex and im not looking for something short term either i want a relationship but i want background to it its so much to ask for and im so conflicted with it all but i miss the feeling of love so much i crave it all the time and i tell myself im worth someones hard work but the times ive put myself out there both myself and others have simply gotten hurt and things justdidnt click it doesnt feel right i dont feel things with others and i crave human contact real human contact i havent felt loved in six months and it eats away at me seeing the one person ive ever loved with my entire being move on and make stupid decisions when im willing to be by their side and help them through their rough patches im tired and lonely i dont know what to do anymore and its been eating away at me since january someone help none of my friends have given me thorough advice and to be fair i cant blame them its a tough situation to battle and even i cant wrap my head around getting through this and im usually good at managing myself ive tried moving on but that doesnt change my desires for feeling loved,pre-pandemic

heres an example i use to explain to others what happens when im tasked with something over the years task has meant homework housework work assignments group tasks personal hobbies fill in the blank situation 1 say you ask someone neurotypical to do task a you need it done in 3 hours they look at it and see about 10 steps needed complete it they work for 2 hours and get 9 of those 10 done good enough they think in their mind theyre ending with a mental todo list 90 finished they go relax for an hour if they got a grade a they walk away feeling good having finished a task and doing it pretty well so 9 out of 10 tasks in 2 hours thats roughly one task every 15 mins to get 90 done and an hour to relax internal score a now situation 2 you ask me adhd 2e to do task a i look and see 100 possible details i catch a vision of what task a could be and am extremely excited by it i see how task a fits into other tasks b c d e f and how it makes them easier for other people task a if done right can support itself help the people who need to do it after me and potentially generate enough resources to create new tasks w x ydare i say even z man if i can get this done task a will be incredible this feelingits electric at first glance i can see at least 9 details related to and needing accounted for each of the original 10 steps im unfamiliar with a couple of the details so ill need to do some research to resolve my questions whats more there are irrelevant details buried in the pile but i dont know which ones yet so ill need to be actively sifting those out while i work for the next 4 hours i work on it like crazy riding the wave of my excitement guided by the image in my head im working hard to get it done but because of distractibility i get sidetracked other random tasks add to that ive come up with 1020 more unforeseen and potentially irrelevant details its okay though im getting momentum and really starting to weave the threads together my focus is having holes poked in it because people keep interrupting me its not malicious they are just being friendly by saying hi or trying to get me to smile because i look so intense they dont know how hard im holding my focus together and that every distraction is like a wind gust against my attentional house of cards theres been some unravelling but i try to shake off my anger and get back to reweaving them quickly ive been working at a pace of about one task every 5 mins i look up and realize its been 4 hours crap im an hour over i take stock of where im at i have crossed 48 tasks off my mental todo list of now 120 but am only about 40 finished thats a big mental f in more ways than one so 48 of 120 tasks in 4 hours one task every 5 minutes and only 40 done score f this is how people with adhd can work twice as long work 3x faster complete more than 5x the amount of tasks see over 1000 more detailand still feel like crap for not getting anything done okayi try to take stock of where i am at the pace i was going it will take me 10 hours to finish the break has made me realize i havent eaten im starting to feel bad im mentally exhausted and my brain is fried im way over my deadline and it was needed an hour ago at this stage its not even finished enough to be usable this isnt the first time this has happened far from it so now im also feeling defeated i also feel demotivated because i dont actually know how much longer its going to take me to finish so i engage in procrastination as a stress relief tool now im working much slower because experiencing this pattern is what kickstarts a depression this always happens i look at what i still need to do its likely going to take me a possible 50 hours to work through the remaining 72 tasks i feel need to get done the end of the task stretches away toward the horizon like a long vast road man this sucks every minute i continue is a slog that drags me down further but it has to get done i stay up all night working on it the silence and lack of interruption helps but its still slow in the morning come the text messages people asking me questions about the task some innocuous hey just checking on the status of task a some not hey we need task a to be done as soon as possible we have people waiting on it when will you be done i feel shame an immediate dread that feels like daggers stress cortisol and adrenaline coursing through my body like a weird familiar fire and then an immediate dive into a full depression i feel they are justified in their frustration im frustrated with me too why does this always happen why cant i just get things done why is this so hard for me when its so easy for other people why cant i just think more simply and then to add to the heartbreak man this could be so useful and so greatif i could just get it done i suck i hate this feeling i wish i wasnt such a failure its a strange thing we have its the source of my creativity and wonder and also the source of my darkest times that feeling fades and some things get better but this pattern seems to be close at all times i feel like im always trying to defend why creative people seem to struggle getting things done while its exacerbated by adhd it is also a problem with creative types while they are commonly judged as flaky or undisciplined i really think it has to do with the challenge of having more dots to connect than the average person and then having to deal with the mental repetitive stress injuries that come from weathering others lack of understanding which then only reflexes back onto the problem like a serpent that is eating its own tail,pre-pandemic
title pretty much sums it up after reading some inspirational posts on here from people who conquered their battles with ha i noticed one of the biggest things they said helped was to stop googling symptoms so im starting small one week of no googling ive already had the urge about 5 times since i woke up 3 hours ago lol but im fighting through it i will be updating this post everyday to say whether i succeeded or not for that given day to keep myself honest i would absolutely love if people on this sub would join me in this challenge if you feel comfortable joining and commenting below that you are doing so that would be amazing i think having a sense of community and camaraderie is extremely important i hope this post isnt breaking any rules if so i apologize and will edit accordingly tuesday 18 update well i made it the whole day it was a struggle i had the urge about 10 times today but i resisted in part thanks to you all i never expected this many people would join this with me and i am so excited and grateful weve got this also due to multiple great suggestions i plan to create another post at the end of the week for an open discussion on how it went for everyone feel free to update on this one as well during the week if it helps you i know updating this every day will help me congratulations everyone day one complete wednesday 19 update made it another day today washard but i fought through it focused on work got more done than i have in a couple weeks and went out for a relaxing dinner and drinks with my husband today was hard i really almost caved earlier but i didnt and again i think i owe a good amount of that to all who joined me in this it feels amazing to be a part of a team to fight this bullshit i got some of my time back today thursday 110 update made it another day today was easier than yesterday focused a lot on work then made a nice dinner when i got home i had some physical symptomssensations but i was able to ignore them long enough for them to move on today was a good day friday 111 update sorry for the late update went out to the bar until the wee hours last night lol yesterday was not as good as friday i made it the whole day but i had to reallllyyy talk myself down in the late afternoon with a weird symptom ive been having i just kept saying i know this is weird but you are not in immediate danger and you are in no pain just move on enjoy the rest of your night and if this persists for weeks you can revisit it then and let me tell ya it fucking worked i totally forgot about it and had an amazing night thank you all for giving me strength this week if i didnt make this post i guarantee i would have caved already saturday 112 update still going strong strong may be a bit of an over exaggeration lol but i am going like i said in the last update my anxiety about my health is still very much there just instead of ruminating on it for hours through google it comes in fleeting spurts that are easy to move on from i still of course think im dying though lol sundaymonday update sorry guys i forgot to update these two days which is actually kind of a good thing because i wasnt thinking about my health to the point of forgetting to even do this i just posted a followup post as discussed for everyone to talk about how the week went,pre-pandemic
i realized recently that who i am when my mental health is good is almost the exact opposite of who i am when things are bad and its not in the way i would expect its like when im in a good place im a lot more strict and careful but when im in a bad place im reckless and fun im still me but its like when things are bad i no longer care has anyone else noticed this,pre-pandemic
hello everyone i should mention that if the concept of a brain aneurysm bothers you this post may make you anxious however the intention is to provide relief to people in my situation by sharing some statistics ive dug up regarding brain aneurysms here are the statistics x200b in the united states the general public has a 5 chance of developing an aneurysm in their lifetime this affects women more than men at a ratio of 32 of these 8590 never show symptoms of these only around 1 occur in children under 18 presumably the number is not greatly higher in young adults 20s though i was not able to find direct statistics on that of all aneurysms only around 1 of aneurysms will ever rupture around 99 of people with unruptured brain aneurysms never have to worry about it and die from something else of these many cases correlate to other risk factors genetics lifestyle habits of this survival rate is as high as 60 x200b based off this its reasonable to conclude that the odds for an otherwise healthy person in their 20s with no risk factors to have an aneurysm are very very unlikely rarer than being struck by lightning literally furthermore while it may seem scary that they cause no symptoms it also may help a hypochondriac to realize that their symptoms are psychosomatic imagined caused by anxiety though of course if symptoms do arise and persist its important to discuss them with a doctor also keep in mind that the symptoms of a ruptured aneurysm are unmistakable some of these statistics may seem obvious but it has helped me to lay them out and i hope it also helps you,pre-pandemic

after a lifetime of denial i can finally start healing it was really difficult to hear but i am coming to accept it i posted here the other day with my symptoms and today i talked over it with her while i had most symptoms of ptsd i had not been able to believe it because i did not experience flashbacks however she said not all people with ptsd experience flashbacks because we might have buried the memories very deep but it comes out through our bodies which is definitely what i experience based on her observations i thought this was interesting to share if anyone else doubts themselves talk to a professional if you can im shaking i could cry it was not my fault i was not too sensitive i was not wrong i was not bad i legitimately experienced trauma and someone told me so today,pre-pandemic
the internet cannot possibly diagnose you for it is literally unable to account for family history severitylevel of pain and other sensations its always vague for example saying if you have chest tightness get to the er instead of if your chest tightness is manageable enough to ignore then youre fine biological diversityhow your body just is we are not perfectly made creatures something you have surely all noticed is that there is something wrong at any given second of any given day and that is normal what youve done that day what youve eaten that day or past few days the state of the environment around you how you slept last night your entire health history remember its not just that the internet over exaggerates everything in order to avoid liability its also that it literally cannot possibly tell you exactly what is wrong for it lacks every single piece of information necessary,pre-pandemic

ive never posted here before but i scroll this sub whenever im having a rough day so i thought i would share my story today makes two years for me i never ever in a million years thought i would be able to say that never thought id be strung out on heroin and cocaine either but here we are my trip through hell all started with a percocet and a cute boy that told me id really like it to this day i dont blame him because i made my own choices but that is where it started within a month of trying opiates for the first time i was traveling out of state to buy heroin and selling it to support our habit life felt unreal i felt untouchable until i got arrested with 200 tickets crossing state lines i remember so vividly the dea agent telling me someday you will thank me i probably saved your life and he was right so thank you tony milligan from maine dea for possibly saving my life sorry for puking in your car i did not get the drugs from your wife obviously like i said i did and you can unfuck yourself now you did save my life i did 14 months in prison have 5 years hanging and 4 years probation i have class a b and c felonies on my record but i wouldnt change a single thing because im alive im in a healthy relationship i dont wake up sick anymore my first thought in conflict is no longer getting fucked up i know there is a huge debate on incarcerating drug addicts and i 100 agree that it shouldnt be the answer in fighting addiction but nothing else would have gotten me clean i had tried rehabs iop 12 step meetings suboxone my brain was sick and the only thing that gave me relief was being locked up they say its jails institutions or death prison got me clean plain and simple im just thankful for life today thanks for listening,pre-pandemic

applied behavior analysis aba is the implemented utilisation of behavioral techniques to daily situations with the aim of either decreasing or increasing aimed behaviors how this changes into practical implementation will rely on the particular situation however every aba program shares the same elements programming for generalisation to the natural ambience discrete trial teaching prompting and fading tactics reinforcement and resultsbased decisionmaking principles of applied behavior analysis for behavior technicians a behavior is considered to be a measurable and noticeable action some fundamental principles of applied behavior analysis for behavior technicians include behavior is weakened or powered by its consequences behavior is actually a product of its ambiance behavior reacts better to positive instead of negative consequences whether a behavior is reinforced or punished is simply known by the behavior in the future punishment weakens and reinforcement powers past behavior can anticipate the future behavior if often a behavior grows it is being reinforced by something or somebody negative or positive reinforcement doesnt imply bad or good it implies to remove taking away or present inclusion behavioral issues compete with precise behaviors and generally win as they are more rewarding and easier an individual might not have learned the precise types of accomplishing the similar function favorable changes will rely on the schedule of reinforcement physical effort involved and how many times they are needed to function some commonly used behavioral terms 1 natural consequences this is something which is straight associated with the behavior for instance getting burned while playing matches carelessly 2 reinforcement this is something which follows a specific behavior and makes that behavior more possible for future occurrence this goes for both incorrect and correct behaviors hence if a behavior is growing regardless of the behavior then something or somebody is reinforcing it 3 positive reinforcement it happens when somebody involves a behavior for gaining or contacting some positive stimulus 4 social consequences this is something which creates sense but is not significantly straight connected with the behavior social consequences are sometimes utilized for teaching lessons which would else be learned just from big risks hence hopefully a person can employ social consequences to the situations so that the natural consequences never need to occur 5 negative reinforcement this happens when somebody involves the behavior of avoiding or escaping some negative stimulus 6 punishment this is something which follows a specific behavior and creates that behavior less possible for occurrence again in the near future 7 fading this is about slowing removing reinforces and prompts which maintain a behavior 8 shaping this is a great way of teaching a new behavior a person is reinforced for following estimates of the preferred behavior slowly growing the criteria for the reinforcement,pre-pandemic

i feel like it makes a huge difference for me whether you are talking to me in person or through text you can say just about the same thing but the wrong phrasing versus the right phrasing makes a world of difference im honestly not sure if it is a bpd thing but i feel like it would make sense for it to be a bad tone just comes off to me as incredibly rude and inconsiderate whereas a thoughtful more sensitive tone conveying the same exact information comes off as 10x nicer it would be like if someone said you need to be able to handle this workload if you are going to make it through grad school versus i think this introductory class is a great opportunity for you to grow more accustomed to the standard workload involved with being a graduate student it says the same information but the second version sounds much more positive and encouraging rather than feeling like im being attacked the first tone makes me feel super dysfunctional and horrible about myself another example i can tolerate our lack of a sex life for now i guess versus i understand that you are working through trauma in therapy right now and am willing to put sex on hold for now since i know that ultimately your goal is to fix the problem big difference but it conveys the same information one feels like a slap in the face and the other feels encouraging and understanding edit the wording wouldnt have to be that extreme but the same phrase with a different tone can feel that drastic in person the wording or context is more relevant in writing sometimes it is literally the same sentence with the wrong tone or poorly timed sighs,pre-pandemic

were writing this in part in response to some popular posts we saw recently and partly in response to a trend weve noticed here this isnt aimed at anyone specifically nor is it an official rulewe have no desire to gate keep or alienate anyone however this is a subreddit centered around a medical condition and those living with it and wed like to keep things medically accurate as much as possible without any judgement or ranking of what is worse we encourage everyone to only use medical terms in ways consistent with the medical literature including terms like mania if you describe something as a manic episode when it is not a manic episode its confusing for everyone we cant offer any help or commiseration when we dont know what is going on its certainly true that the line between mania and hypomania can be a bit fuzzy were not talking about that if there are more than one reasonable and informed opinion that happens but when people describe mania as a welcome and productive event that flies in the face of the diagnostic criteria which require a severe impairment in functioning that is often accompanied by psychosis and hospitalization when someone describes themselves as being currently manic or experiencing a manic episode we think of high levels of impairment potentially including psychosis and loss of insight hypomania can be imparing too especially socially but does not involve the same level of impairment and potential medical emergency as mania another thing that is often ignored here is that for an episode to be considered manic the symptoms and impairment must last at least a week or require hospitalization we understand that some people have slightly shorter episodes and that in the middle of an episode you dont know how long it will last but an episode lasting less than a few days does not qualify as a manic episode hypomania can be shorter with the official requirements being only 4 days minimum but if your symptoms are lasting less than that and have triggers caffeine life events its not necessarily a bipolar episode some amount of change in energy levels over time is not necessarily pathological we hope everyone can understand why we feel this way and that this is not meant to be an attack on anyone we also hope that realizing the full extent of harm caused by mania will help everyone be more understanding when it changes the way someone interacts here or when someone seeks advice on repairing strained bank accounts and personal relationships from ussnakeggirl and umymainismythrowaway1,pre-pandemic

hi guys gals so i had a really bad pain on the left side of my abdomen the other day which i suspect was due to my period check my post history i had anxiety about it but it quickly subsided by the end of the day currently i have anxiety about developing copd because i have asthma and my parents are renovating their home so ive been exposed to a lot of dust to be honest i think ive been thinking a lot of my symptoms into existence like im constantly breathing in and out to check my lung capacity and forcing myself to wheeze i mean i do have a dust allergy but i think im exaggerating it a bit anyways lots of young people have been dying from heart attacks lately lotte van der zee 20 felicite tomlinson 18 etc have recently passed away from heart attacks and they both seemed pretty fit i guess and my fat i see myself as fat but lots of people say im not asthmatic ass is over here not working out not drinking enough water or eating healthy sitting here like oo all of this combined with what ive been experiencing lately has my mind in a rut and i dont know how to cope i dont know what im doing here i might be venting or asking for support im just anxious as hell right now,pre-pandemic
i had another episode last night where i tried to kill myself this one was pretty serious i attribute this to going off my meds over the past couple weeks i had been stable over the past month so i mistakenly thought i didnt need my meds anymore i titrated myself off of the meds carefully and didnt get any withdrawal symptoms so i thought i was totally fine unfortunately this past week was a steady decline in my mental health until it came to a head yesterday throughout the day yesterday i kept thinking that i was hearing police sirens and had bad paranoia that cops were coming to lock me up i felt like i was stuck in some alternate reality where i had to kill myself thankfully i ended up stopping myself before i died i hanged myself but the pain was unbearable and i called a friend she stayed overnight with me to make sure i was safe and didnt try anything again rest assured im back on my meds and will see my therapist and psychiatrist asap please please please do not go off your meds without a doctors approval it may seem like in the moment all is lost and death is the only option but its not its totally possible to bounce back and continue living a happy life,pre-pandemic
im not a doctor so only read further if youve been checked out by your doctor and told youre healthy a bit of backstory ive had heart palpitations on and off since 2015 they began a few months before i had to move countries on my own for university and leave everything and everyone behind for my palpitations they always felt more like a sinking feeling i could best describe it as when youre in one of those slow moving elevators and its the feeling you get in your stomachchest when the elevator stops agonisingly slowly i know very specific when a plane first lifts off and you can feel it in your whole body that youre suddenly no longer touching the ground when something jumps in front of you and your heart sinks in your stomach so you can guess i had a fun time explaining the above feelings to not one or two doctors the looks ive got were amazing after being checked by multiple doctors in two countries they never ever found anything blood tests ambulance called ekg more recently an xray pretty sure the only thing i havent had was a 24hour heart monitor because as im 22 and doctors never found anything no one was concerned enough to set me up with one my mom always calms me down with one doctor could be mistaken but 7 cant all make the same mistake so you just gotta trust them a few months ago i had a full week of palpitations seven days exactly and they stopped just as sudden as they started one day i was fine the other day i was having a palpitation every few minutes and in seven days they stopped i went to the emergency room as i was having a palpitation literally every 45 minutes sometimes more and a few things happened at the emergency 1 i had a palpitation while connected to a heart monitor 2 the doctor could not see it when checking the printout version of my heart rhythm not sure of the proper naming of it but its that long piece of paper with your heart rhythm on it i was amazed how could i have a palpitation and for it to not be visible as it turns out women can have palpitations based on hormone activity that are considered so tiny and so normal that are basically not detected by heart monitors but if the woman is highly sensitive or suffering from health anxiety shes more prone to feeling it imagine feeling a palpitation when even ecg cannot recognise it as such so i just wanted to share some things and possibly help 1 heart palpitations in women can very often be a hormone change such as period ovulation or sometimes as simple as pms 2 as everyone has said before caffeine is a big no if youre suffering from palpitations but also chocolate and foods high in sugar if im having palpitations and ive been eating too much sugar i take it as my body saying stop it now 3 w a t e r i cannot possibly stress it enough the amount of palpitations ive had that were solely because i was dehydrated i always carry a water bottle with me now and when im experiencing palpitations i drink even more than usual because it makes not only my heart but my body work better 4 being too hot can also cause palpitations after a hot shower or wearing too much clothes 5 the vagus nerve its a nerve connecting your stomach and your brain that passes right next to the heart and can cause palpitations if the stomach is dealing with overeating too heavy food too spicy etc this video explains it in detail 6 and most importantly if it causes you panic its not a heart attack ive spoken with quite a few people that has survived heart attacks and they all said the same they were not panicking when it happened they were worried but their bodies literally could not panic as it was a life and death situation and they had to be sane enough to reach for help and survive so if you panic its just a sign its safe and youll be fine hope all of this helps at least a bit youre not alone and its gonna be okay edit thank you for the gold im fairly new here so im not sure what exactly does it mean but it must be good haha i forgot to mention one more additional reason behind palpitations so im including it above,pre-pandemic

youre trying to manage the same stuff everybody else is able to manage but marbles keep falling out of your hands and neurotypical people are giving advice like well why dont you just put them in your bag because i dont have a bag maybe youre struggling to carry only 50 marbles and you see people around you easily managing 150 which is bitterly discouraging but the fact that you can even hold on to that many is incredible because you dont have a bag but youre still trying medication is like having a bag with a hole in it its so much better than what youre used to so when you start using it you feel on top of the world then you notice that marbles are slowly falling out and you think whats the point its just as bad as before but you have to remember its still worth it the worst thing you can do is trip on the marbles youve dropped thats my biggest struggle i focus on one little thing ive messed up and all of a sudden ive come crashing down and drop all the marbles i was able to hold minutes before i dont really know where im going with this but as soon as i thought of the analogy i hyperfixated on it of course and had to share it hopefully this helps you in some way maybe as a way to explain adhd to people who dont get it edited to add not everyone wantsneeds meds and thats fine the bag with a hole can represent whatever coping mechanism fits you best eg therapy 2nd edit to those asking if they can steal this no you cant because im freely giving it to you do with it what you will no credit necessary,pre-pandemic

the hearing was today i didnt go but the victims services advocate ive been talking to emailed me about it i didnt end up writing an impact statement i tried but it was too triggering so i let the advocate know that and she asked for my permission to tell the parole board that i was too triggered to write an impact statement because that alone gives an idea of the impact so i told her to tell them and that i also thought they should know that ive been diagnosed with ptsd and im in therapy and on antidepressants and anxiety medication and medical marijuana for it the email said the reasons for the denial are nature and circumstances of the offense injury and impact to the victims and inadequate institutional program participation i replied to ask her when hed be up for parole again and she said he wont be the board denied him with no chance for a rehear there are other means of release thru the department of corrections please be sure to keep your registration current so that if he applies you will be notified im so relieved and he didnt even get to leave prison to go to the courthouse they did a video conference from the prison and no one showed up in support of him or even to do an impact statement no one he knew cares about him anymore theres no one who wants him released he has nothing and no one and im glad even if he does get out theres at least 7 men in my family who own guns and want to shoot him and hes well aware of that so hed probably stay away i found out recently that when he was first questioned after i reported the abuse he asked the police to protect him from my father hes a pathetic bastard,pre-pandemic

when i was fat a boy called me a beached whale in front of our sports class the teacher told him to settle down as i felt my cheeks burn when i was fat a friend jiggled my double chin and said if i just lost weight i could be pretty she told me my chubby cheeks made me look like a squirrel when i smiled it took me a long time to learn to love my smile again after that when i was fat my dad asked me where he went wrong as a parent how could my brother be so athletic while i ballooned each year in this household where carbs were practically a reincarnation of the devil himself when he found the empty ice cream containers and chocolate wrappers he told me i was disgusting he said he was embarrassed to tell people i was his daughter when i was fat i bought an expensive jumpsuit for a big upcoming party i spent hours perfecting my hair and makeup i squeezed into heels so that my legs could look long when i got there the boy i liked looked me up and down turned to his friend and loudly whispered fat b they laughed and left and i wished i could fall through the floor when i got home that night i cried because i was a shy nerdy girl and i couldnt imagine what i had done to make him say that i thought i used food to control my emotions but really i was controlled by food every night when my family had gone to sleep id pull out thousands of calories from underneath my bed id buy it after school from the grocery store a different one each time because i feared the cashiers would recognise me and see exactly where all this food went my cheeks my waist my thighs id stuff my face until my stomach ached and the nausea crept up my throat and i was sure i had abused myself enough to truely be the beast people told me i was over the past year ive lost enough weight to now be on the low side of a healthy bmi ive basically switched to a restriction ed largely driven by the comments of people around me and today the boy who called me a fat b asked me out for dinner after over a year of not seeing each other he said i looked great and he wondered why we didnt talk more in high school i wanted to break down and yell at him for ruining my self esteem i wanted him to know how many nights i had spent crying over his careless words but instead smiled and said i was happier leaving the past in the past i dont know why i wrote this i guess im just frustrated with how the world works i wish i could have enjoyed high school i wish people could have seen more to me than just my weight i wish i didnt think about food constantly oh well,pre-pandemic
i find that when im feeling and doing good i can make friends and talk to people easily i wouldnt say im a very social person because i very much enjoy my alone time but im able to appear normal hate that word and very social to people i start a connection with someone and everythings great but when im depressed i ignore peoples texts and calls and completely isolate they end up getting fed up and take it personally like i dont want anything to do with them anymore ive gotten better at explaining that im struggling and need space and that its not them that is the problem however the connection is still ost because we dont talk or hangout for weeks and they have more consistent friendships going on with other people anyone relate,pre-pandemic
trigger warning vague mentions of domestic violence if this isnt the place to post this im sorry i was diagnosed with ptsd and anxiety disorder a few years after a trauma i suffered when i was ten but i had symptoms before then and i didnt know why i had memories of my father yelling at and abusing my mother from my really early childhood and my mom said i was afraid of him for most of my childhood because of it but until she told me this i had always thought the memories were bad dreams or that i had made it up her telling me that these things did in fact happen confirms that they werent dreams at all because i never told her about them but the stuff she described is exactly what happened in those dreams im sorry if my writing doesnt make sense has anything like this happened to anyone else,pre-pandemic
we are looking for data preferably lab data on the connection between autism and various plastics leeching over time some of the plastics of particular interest in this study are bpas phthalates and highdensity polyethylene hdpe if anyone knows a really good free and open publicly available site or facility we can get this data from that would be great is there any free database community or library you could recommend that has credible results,pre-pandemic
no i dont want to get better in fact i want to get worse i want to get so bad that i have no choice but to kill myself why would i want to get better if i want to die getting better will only slightly decrease my depression to the point where i still feel like shit but not enough to want to die and im sorry but thats the opposite of what i want i dont want to dish out a ridiculous amount of money for someone to convince me that i should keep living this ridiculously expensive and worthless life for another few decades death is the only way to free myself from all the problems in my life medication and therapy might minimize it but itll never truly go away the longer im alive the more problems will pop up and ending it right now is the only reasonable thing for me to do,pre-pandemic
as you have read actor robin williams is dead an apparent suicide in interviews williams alluded to depressive episodes and manic behavior at least on stage as late as 2006 in an npr interview he denied any official diagnosis of depression or bipolar disorder his casual comments about mood swings have led some writers to label him bipolar in news reports but there appears to be no medical confirmation of his illness and thats fine a mans medical condition is his own business and none of ours ultimately it doesnt matter if williams suffered from bipolar disorder or major depressive disorder whats significant here and now is that a man with huge critical acclaim with great wealth with golden globes and an oscar this man who had everythingeven with all that he was moved to end his life i want to tell this to people who say i should just go for a 20minute walk in the sunshine every afternoon and my depression will go away after all it worked for them when they were sad after their dog ran away i want to remind people of it when they tell me bipolar disorder is just moods and that i ought to be able to shake them off the ones who say i would be productive if only i felt it important enough implying that i dont care or that i am merely lazy i want to rub peoples face in the fact that there is not always a correlation between success and untroubled happiness bipolar disorder and depression are not the same as the sadness that naturally follows after setbacks and bad luck i want to thrust the headlines under the noses of people who assure me id be fine if i switched to the latest macrobiotic diet or if i stopped watching the news and thinking sad thoughts to all of those who have sought to dismiss my bipolar disorder as just mood swingsto all of those who have found me depressed and asked why as if my depression must be a normal emotional response to a sad eventto all those who have minimized my victory in getting through the day and concluded that i could shake off this disease and do anything if i were just motivated enoughrobin williams and i say fuck you depression is an electrochemical disorder in the brain it is not the same as the everyday depression we feel when we get a b instead of an a on the sociology exam mania and hypomania are physiological states of being out of control not of moral irresponsibility robin williams had everything a man could want then depression reached out of his cold soul and snuffed him out so dont tell me its just a bad mood my family and friends have tried to be sympathetic and i give them credit for it but in all the years since my diagnosis not one has consistently understood that this is a disease not a bad mood i see them bite their tongues as they carefully dont say why dont you just decide to feel better the way i did after i got passed over for the promotion i had worked so hard to get when normal people try to understand what we go through by comparing it to the everyday moods they call depressed and manic it offends me when people casually refer to their moodiness as bipolar it hurts us all i suffer from bipolar ii last i checked that puts me at higher risk of suicide than any other mental illness my disease is more likely to kill me than obesity would or smoking a pack a day of cigarettes suicide is right here with me at my elbow every day im sorry robin williams is dead im sad for his family and his fans im going to wring some good out of his life and his death by using his suicide as a teaching moment for the people around me,pre-pandemic
just making light of the health anxiety that i feel is quickly taking over my life,pre-pandemic
so this is a really hard topic to talk about for me its been several years about 6 and while ill forget about what happened the generalized anxiety it brought still never goes away first off for context im just gonna show who the serial killer was it was a pretty big story in my state and really big on youtube if you spent any time on there in 2012 mr anime anyways i woke up today with a comment from a video on youtube that i posted on it was a web documentary that someone did on him and i thought it was a nice way to get some of this off my chest of course this really didnt help and i ended up super anxious people taunting me about it and all sorts of troll behavior you get in youtube comments a little backstory i grew up with trey from the age of 12 until he killed his family when i was 22 i had been in contact and hung out with him up until like 3 months before he did the act he cut contact with me around then which im pretty sure he either didnt want to subject me to that or something when i say we were best friends i mean we were best friends i spent the night at his house 3 times a week we had all night wow gaming sessions his mom would cook us lunch and dinner so we didnt even have to stop raiding his family was so good to me they were basically a second family i was in his first ever youtube video and i continued making shorts and sketches with him and even helped with a couple of his anime reviews when he specialized his channel when he moved to his grandparents house in hempstead i visited often and we made it kind of a party house he filled his cabinets with liquor and he loved playing the host whenever i came back from college to visit we definitely indulged in pot and prescription meds but we were young and stupid i didnt do drugs outside of our weekend chill sessions and i didnt realize he had been addicted to those and alcohol the thing about trey is he always was pretty secretive if i ever asked him much about his life or his relationship with his parents hed try to change the subject dont get me wrong i knew a lot about him more than his other friends but it took a lot of work by me to get him to open up many a night smoking weed and me opening up about my feelings before he finally did about his dissatisfaction with life his lack of a higher education and his fathers disappointment in him i would always try to cheer him up and make him feel better and it seemed to work when the murders happened i didnt even know what to do my girlfriend at the time comforted me but i was justnumb i literally didnt feel anything then my roommate at the time was like oh lets smoke a bowl thatll cheer you up and that was when i had my first panic attack im talking full on im gonna die oh my god this went on for nearly 2 days constantly pacing and checking my heart rate i couldnt sleep or eat and felt like i was going insane i actually packed up and drove to dallas i lived in austin to go to my moms because i didnt know what to do and she had a xanax prescription and gave me one and i slept for nearly 20 hours ive struggled with anxiety for years now i learned its caused by ptsd from the events i have no health insurance so i cant really go to therapy unless i foot the entire bill so it really sucks this is my only way to talk about it honestly other than friends who dont really understand no one really understands my dad thinks i should just get over it shit happens but hes never had his fucking best friend kill his second family a family that was honestly nicer than his real family who treated him with love and respect and not judgement anyways sorry for the erratic writing or if it jumps around a lot im kind of in a panicked mindset because i got triggered by all the memories of trey its hard for me to organize my thoughts when i get into this mindset it feels like i cant focus on any thought and my mind is just swimming and it leaves me confused if anyone has any questions id love to answer but id also love some advice and support thanks for reading edit everyone that responded thank you so so much you have no idea how much this means to me im in this weird place between joy and guilt that this got so many comments joy because i realized people care so much about a random person and guilt because i feel i dont deserve that compassion yes i know thats stupid but that comes with the anxiety sadly like others have said i feel i may have a bit of survivors guilt because i learned i was actually a target of his and i read and article by someone yesterday where he did an interview with texas rangers supposedly when he was 13 he was considering killing one of his friends i know that friend was me i remember that day because we were playing with guns as country kids will do and i remember him aiming in my general direction but kind of doing a haha i got you thing that he loved doing anyways im trying to respond to everyone but i work 11am11pm the next 2 days yay service industry so if i havent responded yet i will definitely try ill be going back to my inbox and on this post and trying to get to everyone thank you for taking the time to share and care seriously,pre-pandemic
wednesday evening i had a guy ive been seeing the last month or so come over to my place wed slept together before and id already felt relatively safe but this time i got triggered i dont know why maybe it was the stress but when he bit my leg something i usually enjoy i triggered and i started flailing and kicking then rolled over on my side and covered my face he was gentle and checked on me and i apologized and he pulled me in to cuddle after i calmed down a bit i said something about how we should talk about it he said that we didnt have to i dont disclose i was in denial of my rapes and abuse for years and when it all came out i told my boyfriend at the time wed been together for years we lived together i completely believed that he was going to be supportive instead he verbally abused me for hours told me i was a slut and a liar and other horrible things i have struggled with disclosure ever since and have missed out on potential relationships because my fear of disclosing makes me disconnected and withdrawn disclosure is a huge barrier for me but i disclosed i had to work myself up to it and he was patient he already knew i had ptsd so i said my ptsd comes from sexual assault and domestic violence i talked a little about it and explained my reaction i had to work myself up to it but i did it i was still very activated so i put on music and told him we should talk about other things to distract me so he let me show him all my gemstones i recently got he literally listened to me talk about rocks i managed to pull myself back and finish having sex with him and he was gentle even though i knew it wasnt his preference i kept apologizing to him about everything that happened and he told me it was okay and to stop apologizing this is a huge event for me disclosure to a sexual partner has never been successful for me most of the time it doesnt happen potential relationships have been impaired by my avoidance disclosure itself carries trauma for me ive been talking in therapy about how to disclose for years so this is a big deal for me and im proud of me i hope that this means ill start being able to have this discussion with more serious romantic partners and ill stop ruining relationships,pre-pandemic
does anyone else get irrationally annoyed by those videos i have no problem with someone posting about their ed story but i do have a problem when the whole video is essentially a slideshow of weight loss body checks over sad music clearly posted by a quasirecovered girl for validation inevitably half the comments end up being im only 13 but is it bad that i want her body after she lost weight or you werent even fat before or i weigh 105 lbs and im the fattest girl in my class this video made me want to starve myself its always the same story too i was a happy kid then i got bulliedbecame depressed and wanted to go on a diet and stopped eating and look how skinny i got and look how sick and sad i was with a tube up my nose and look how recovered i am now even though i just left inpatient and am still underweight,pre-pandemic
this happened to me today i was with my wife and motherinlaw who both know im bipolar and some family friends of theirs who im pretty sure dont know im bipolar and they were talking about someones kid and how the kid has been lashing out and harming other people and immediately one of them said oh i bet theyre bipolar it just pisses me off how people think they know what theyre talking about when they have no idea what is going on at all really part of me wanted to leave the room part of me wanted to tell them about actually being bipolar but i just sat there quietly and felt like an alien i was also wondering what was going through the minds of my wife and mother in law while their friends were saying this then my fatherinlaw came in and randomly suggested that another totally unrelated person was bipolar for some reason i have no idea why this popped into his head just a coincidence i guess but it just made me feel more isolated and like im keeping some secret that i really shouldnt have to keep anyway i guess im just venting thanks for reading,pre-pandemic
i realized the other day while i was curling up in my bed that if i havent so much as been hugged by anyone since my girlfriend left me 5 years ago its been so long that im afraid if anyone was to hug me in a serious way that i might break down into an emotional mess does anyone else here understand that feeling,pre-pandemic
ever since ive had my first psychosis more than a month ago and been put on medication quetiapine aka seroquel i havent been the same studying seems impossible i am easily distracted and cannot retain new information easily my memory is failing me continuously and even as i am writing this i fail to find the correct words language used to come so easily to me ive been quick to learn and a bright student all my life but now i feel like what ive been working for getting a bachelors degree is slipping through my fingers my brain just doesnt work like it used to and it is frustrating beyond belief my psychiatrist has already agreed to get me on lithium instead of quetiapine to see if the brain fog was caused by the medication but a part of me is afraid scared that psychosis did not only hurt me as it was happening but wrecked something in my brain beyond repair that this disorder will keep chipping away at me episode after episode until i am left with vague memories of the bright individual i used to be and that loved ones can only observe as i slip into this new persona they hardly recognise usually i try to end every post on a positive note so youre not left with the bitter taste of hopelessness so i guess ill say human brains are incredibly adaptive maybe i can learn to learn again maybe this is a lesson in itself maybe i was never meant to be an academic and this will push me onto another path that will bring more happiness in my future,pre-pandemic

im a 23 years old and have two and a half years off iv opiates crack and benzos i was a well behaved kid athlete in high school and got scholarships to syracuse and quinnipiac the problem is i havent related to anyone on an emotional level since i was 18 before heroin i dont have a single peer that i really confide in no one that i connect with no one that can understand what i went through and worse no one that wants to i dont blame them but itd really be nice to know someone who gets it i spend my time learning stuff on the computer reading staying up late spending time with my son and taking competitive gaming way too seriously im engaged and have a 17 month old son and live with my fiance shes not as interested in academics as i am im currently going to school for computer engineering at community college and most of our conversation is just madatory stuff get diapers make a bottle sometimes i just want an engaging conversation but i cant get that anywhere not with my friends not with my fiance however we have built a foundation to build a marriage on through our love for our son were both consistent but its nothing exciting thats what love is im pretty sure right that movie shit either doesnt exist or doesnt last i fucking love my son hes the best thing thats ever happened to me and i cant wait to show him the world we go to a kids gym on fridays and its the highlight of my week but i cant shake the feeling that hell be able to tell in a few years that dads smile isnt genuine that my optimism is feigned what will i tell him when he points this out ive tried naaameetings to meet new people but im from a rural part of ct groups here are shit and i cant connect with anyone im great at appearances but im pretty sure i just hate everyone i dont know will this be for the rest of my life is there anyone whos in recovery from iv heroin addiction and isnt a fucking loser or am i the fucking loser i seriously cant tell but ive come to terms with it i think im not meant to connect with people anymore granted im extroverted and personable but i seriously havent had any real connection since i fell in love with heroin i sleep 4 hours a night so i can spend from 103am by myself and thats the only time i enjoy myself im so alone and im surrounded by people that think theyre so close to me and theyre so glad to have me back from the pitfalls of addiction but none of them know that when drugs took me down i never actually got up im not suicidal and im not in danger of using im just fucking broken,pre-pandemic
wow what a freakin roller coaster life has been over the last 5 years i just wanted to write this for anyone considering quitting and this is coming from someone who about a month ago never would have thought that id be abstaining from just about every chemical out there ill try to keep this short but basically ive been abusing alcohol and various kinds of drugs since the age of 16 blackouts and doing dumb shit was all fair game over the last 14 years and despite all the troubles it caused me i never realized how damaging it was until i stopped it all the contrast ive witnessed in just a short time is what inspired me to write this post hopefully it helps someone my opiate problem started when i was 18 after a knee surgery it was true love at first buzz but thank god i never had full access to it until the age of 25 which is right when things got a little out of control i was introduced to oxys by a coworker which naturally blew percocets out of the water no more cold water extraction just pure oxy and the worst part im a functional addict so hitting rock bottom was more of an internal rock bottom and that surely came this went on off and on for about 5 years and thousands and thousands of dollars wasted on that dragon chasing ride i thought i was clever hiding it from everyone but the truth was everyone knew they always find out after long enough alcohol on the other hand was a constant never going more than a day or two without procuring a decent buzz foggy mornings became the norm and a baseline feeling like shit was the status quo about 4 months ago i lost my job which i wrote about a few months back it was a super bullshit situation which is when my usage of both alcohol and opiates sky rocketed more so than my normal usage of about 90150mgs a day i knew it was sky rocketing and that the problem was snow balling so october 20th 2019 i decided to stop the opiates once and for all no more one last times and ill stop tomorrow after i was already blasted its real easy to commit to stopping something when youre high but this time something internally felt different it felt for real this time holy hell im sure people who have used heroin might have more horrific stories but i went through the gnarliest withdrawals ive ever experienced hot cold back to hot sweating damn near shitting myself throwing up not eating back to the blankets turning on the fan taking off the blanket then freezing and putting them back on racing thoughts anxiety like youd never believe so many cravings and the worst the worst insomnia ive ever experienced although the worst of the physical symptoms subsided after about 34 days the insomnia went on for 12 days 12 hellish days that i will not forget my sleep still isnt perfect but at least now its manageable and worse was the booz i was chugging to make the symptoms go away and they certainly did for about 2 hours which was then followed by the worst boomerang effect ever anxiety worse insomnia worse depression way worse if youre quitting opiates do yourself a favor and stay away from booz seriously it makes it worse fast forward to november 4th 2019 and there i was hammered at 12pm passed out by 2pm and already hungover by 7pm i had enough i felt disgusted with myself and was sick of causing all this self induced pain so i quit and just for good measure i quit smoking too so here i am 24 days sober of opiates and 9 days sober from alcohol and cigarettes and if im honest really proud of it i have never in my adult life gone more than 4 days without drinking and all i can say is i have genuinely never felt better in my life everyone is different and everyones journey to sobriety is unique but all i can say is that for me it took a deep internal desire to stop this madness no one on this planet can convince you to stop but you has it been easy fuck no some days is moment to moment but the cravings come and they predictably go almost right on cue but deep within my soul i am committed to putting an end to this problem so despite me not being sober for that long i know myself to know that im done with this shit now im poised to face my demons with a sober mind that will undoubtedly take some callousing no more numbing unresolved problems things that have helped me tremendously meditation running every morning and cleaning up my diet personally i do things to the extreme so maybe you might like a more gradual approach but the point of this is i feel so much better that i cant even describe in words i am someone who struggled with constant depression and anxiety and crippling social anxiety and to my absolute amazement it is literally gone i never realized how badly the vicious cycle was affecting all parts of my life here i was thinking it helped my social life only to find it was killing it any time i think of going back i think back to the horrible horrible withdrawals and all the times i justified using only to regret it immediately after this has been key for me and when i have cravings instead of white knuckle fighting them i just acknowledge that theyre there and let them come and go like clouds in the sky easier said than done but every day gets just slightly easier so much for keeping this short but if youre trying to quit just know that although its going to undoubtedly suck the other side is so worth the pain and struggle it feels like life truly starts when you put down whatever numbing agent youre attached to and finally face reality with a clean mind but in my experience that day doesnt come without some serious internal conviction to stop if youre struggling you got this we got this cheers to all of you who can relate thank you all for the support and kind words truly means a lot to me and full disclosure i just ran into an exco worker who is absolutely gorgeous and i was so awkward something i used drugs and alcohol to mask so saying that was gone was a little premature but now something to work on with a sober mind update for everyone who sees this in the future im still sober off both alcohol and opiates 32 days off alcohol 42 days off opiates some days are harder than others but still going strong we got this,pre-pandemic
theres a real push in pc culture right now for not just people with ptsd but rape and abuse victims also to not call themselves victim but rather survivor the problem with that is i was victimized that kind of language benefits the people who harm us because if they see us as survivors than they can go on abusing us and its like it doesnt matter you can do anything to a survivor also it shames people coming forward because the word victim has become negative and shameful i think instead of replacing victim with another word we should be making it so that victim is not a shameful thing to be you hear whining mostly on the right mostly aimed at women about people mostly women accused of playing the victim the solution to that isnt to call yourself something else but to assert that yes i am a victim but no i am not playing or pretending this all actually happened to me if i were a survivor i feel like that just makes me violable because im then expected to be tough enough to handle it it puts pressure on victims by telling us to get over it and cope and be strong rather than pressuring abusers to change their shitty patterns of behavior i understand that individual people might like feeling like a survivor but i feel like the label is toxic because its telling the victims how to approach handling being victimized i do want to be a victim because i was one and fuck anyone telling me what to call myself this was also brought up in the second season of thirteen reasons why and i thought like many mental health issues in that show that it was handled in such a garbage way basically a main character was raped while under the influence of alcohol at a party she has a hard time getting over it a feminist in charge of a rape survivors group tells her to join them when youre ready to stop being a victim and start being a survivor in other words her shaming the character into being the right kind of strong survivor type of person and being sad was seen as weak she was also shaming her into going forward with legal action against her rapist the show acted like it was important that she do that no sympathy for victims who do not report i feel like this is reflective of larger problems with society wanting everyone to always project an aura of strength and confidence where we bully ridicule and shame people for being weak or emotionally damaged,pre-pandemic
hey rhealthanxiety just thought id make a post detailing my personal experience and knowledge about reassurance seeking and why it is self destructive so youre experiencing your symptom that youre increasingly more worried about whether that be chest pains heart palpitations stomach problems poop problems any of the hundreds of symptoms any of us could possibly be worried about youre worried about if this is the time where your worrying is justified or if it is actually a sign of the illness youre fearing maybe youve already been to the doctor to get checked out but doubt their opinion all of these have happened to me and happen to many many other ha sufferers which is completely okay however the way you deal with it is paramount to your recovery usually what i would do is post here explaining my symptoms and what i was worried it was then id get some replies reassuring me and maybe feel better for a bit or id ask a close friend or family member and get the same results all of this felt like what i had to do a huge compulsion to do this just to know that i was fine in the short term yes it made me feel better but this was only short lived this might also account for medical tests ive spoken to many people who have previously thought that getting that mri or ct colonoscopy or endoscopy or whatever it might be would make all their worries go away which after the short term relief the anxiety came back this is so important to understand and grasp to begin recovering from health anxiety i speak from experience one of the biggest things in recovery is how you deal with these thoughts and need for reassurance possibly even the key to fixing your health anxiety so if you dont seek that reassurance whats going to happen for me at first it was unbareable anxiety and just an extreme desire to check i was okay whether that was through posting to the subreddit the discord asking family checking my body for lumps checking my lymph nodes etc youll most likely experience increased anxiety whilst not seeking the reassurance you want which is completely okay rather than seeking reassurance do something mindful something genuinely healthy for the mind as when in a very high anxiety situation sometimes its the things that you do during that time that really define how your mental wellbeing will go in the future you can do many things for me it was taking myself away from what i was doing and spending 10 minutes trying to immerse or distract myself within something else not an easy task by any means but something to try after the 10 minutes was up i would come back to what i was doing and try to revert my thoughts away from my worry which most times the anxiety had passed and i didnt need to seek further reassurance you could possibly try meditation though if you dont regularly practice it itll be very difficult to do under high anxiety levels you could try relaxing music your favourite food anything else that enhances your mood whatever works for you during this time you will experience anxiety potentially more during that time of not seeking the reassurance but i promise you in the long run it is going to do wonderful things compared to getting the reassurance and feeding the problem when you seek reassurance youre reinforcing the behaviours which keep your health anxiety alive unfortunately because usually it feels like the right thing and the only thing to do in that situation but trust me try not seeking it itll be very similar to this graph the more you do it the easier itll be and it might get to the point where the anxiety almost completely goes after a while of practicing this seriously it is worth definitely giving a go and thinking about this if youre currently having a lot of anxiety ive been there hundreds of times and applying this mentality was one of the key turning points into recovering from health anxiety,pre-pandemic

just want to add for people that dont know this yet reference citation from nhs nhs if you are diagnosed with bipolar disorder and the dx is a certainty you absolutely cannot go off of your mood stabilizer lamictal lithium depakote etc because bipolar is a progressive disorder this means each episode will get more and more severe unless treatedboth the mania and the depression and trust me if you mess with or dont take the appropriate meds at a certain point you may very well likely either end up at the hospital at best or die by suicide the black depression and mixed episodes are unbearable and very dangerous to yourself and perhaps others in the case of mania no one wants to hear this i understand but there is insurmountable evidence that bipolar is a genetic based and hereditary disorder it is highly treatable but has no cure i hear so many stories from doctors who are ticked and devastated by patients who get better with lithiummeds but who refuse to keep taking them regularly due to stigma and side effects please please do not under any circumstance shame or encourage ppl to stop their meds unless you are that persons doctor doctors end up with some form of ptsd and burn out from the number of patients who go off their meds and end up dead relapses are also traumatizing in itself and it further complicates things this is why so many people with bipolar have ptsd as well if you find the side effects intolerable please discuss this with a doctor and work out other options im literally not bullshitting this here is a youtube link to a talk by the most respected scholar in the field of mood disorders for more helpful literature google dr kay redfield jamison further note it is also super important to get enough sleep and avoid drugs and alcohol i used to make leeway with this and take my meds and still use recreational drugs thinking it was no big deal but they really mess with your medications another reason is because marijuana and alcohol interrupt your natural sleep cycle in a major way and contributes to further instability research shows lithium is generally the most effective of the stabilizers despite being the oldest and unpopular medication thankfully its cheap as fuck if you would like to know about my personal dealings with the disorder and feelings about medication heres the link to my replycomment to a question asked about why is lithium unpopular umoodistry made a good point about how medication isnt the only route towards healing and that alternative routes are equally valid which should not be shamed i agree with them but want to add that while this is a valid point medication is the fastest and most effective method of treatment for majority of people with bipolar disorder especially in the most severe cases severe episodes will not be helped by alternative therapy although i can see them being useful as adjunct treatment when a person is in a more stabilized state but i am adamant about taking this to a professional first going off medication is very risky without proper handling if you are uninsured and do not qualify for medicaid google for a free medication clinic near you as well as slidingscale clinics also all big hospitals are required by law to take you into their er regardless of your ability to pay and insurance status,pre-pandemic

its been common for a few years now for people to use the word triggered online when someone gets upset at something that was postedsaid it bothers me because i feel it minimizes actual triggers when im triggered my body almost goes into shock i cant breathe my chest hurts i get dizzy etc someone getting angry at someone with a maga hat isnt triggered they are angry i wouldnt wish ptsd on anyone but i wish more people understood the gravity of an actual trigger for those of us with ptsd edited for clarity i am referencing when someone says that another person is triggered because they got upset or angry im my experience only online example person a there will never be equality because men are simply superior to women person b what the fuck is your problem are you that stupid go back into your hole incel person a oohhh person a is triggered,pre-pandemic

i recently listened to an adhd podcast where a psychiatrist spoke at length about adhd and in a nutshell this is what he said there are 3 pieces of adhd 1 people with adhd have a nervous system that works perfectly well he never found anything they couldnt do but it works on the basis of interest challenge novelty urgency and perhaps passion it doesnt work at all on importance rewards and consequences which is what neurotypical brains respond to 2 rejection sensitive dysphoria intense emotional response to the perception not necessarily the reality of rejection teasing or criticizing by others 3 internal sense of hyperarousal moods created by adhd are almost always triggered by events and perceptions and resolve very quickly they are normal moods in every way except for their intensity i hope this provides you some insight like it did for me take care all edit i cant mention the name of the podcast because as someone else tried automod will delete it the guest psychiatrist was william dodson md edit2 maybe its the internal sense of hyperarousal lol but im tearing up over here about the platinum i made this post to share information that made sense to me and hearing other people in the comments have the same response i initially did fills my heart then platinum im very grateful edit3 uerickow was able to listen to the podcast and explain 1 a bit better omnipotential adhd people can do anything if they can get engaged enough insensitivity to importance as a motivator,pre-pandemic
i dont wanna get ripped apart for this my anxiety telling me know one wants to hear your voice but i have to get this off my chest and im sure someone needs to hear this to those that use their medications correctly and are dedicated to owning up to our disorders learning to manage the bipolar and yourself the healthy way for those that got sober to take a stand in self management of your bd for those that got sober because they are taking your medicine seriously and realize that drinking and self medicating will only ever trigger you make your bd more extreme ill say it again for those that are dedicated to your treatment and are not abusing your medications and taking your treatment seriously and staying dedicated to the bigger picture for those finding ways to cope and manage yourself everyday you are doing heroic things that many do not have the courage to face you are your self hero you are amazing for leveling up and doing what you have to do to take control of your life you are amazing for working everyday to face your disorder raw and really feel your life for what it is and learn to manage yourself it is tough af to be sober take medication everyday and create a new life for yourself and learn how to feel and recognize these emotions wo having a conniption or acting off impulse but you know what you are tough af and you need to keep doing exactly what youre doing and stick to your plan you are not alone and what youre doing to help yourself is legendary and you deserve praise and recognition everyday so please give it to yourself if no one else is you are going places and you will get there never loose sight of your dream and never give up on your treatment because you are capable and you deserve to peace rant over,pre-pandemic
my best friend killed himself at the end of september and i still cant handle it im 28f and he was 30m he was the most amazing person i had ever known and he told me once last june about his plans to commit suicide i tried to support him but he killed himself months afterwards i know that as i was at the time i couldnt be the reason he would want to live but it hurts so much that he left me he was the only one who would or could help i called him crying very late one night when he had a test the next day at 8 am and he came over and spent the night with me and then took his test on two hours of sleep and aced it because he was a genius how am i ever going to find a guy like him again i loved him but i never told him and he died all alone feeling like he was unloved ive cried every night since he died wishing i could join him in death i cant feel anything for anyone else he made me feel beautiful and loved and cared for in a way i never thought was possible now hes goneforever im such a failure i failed him i never made him feel like he made me feel he used to put his hand on my cheek and tell me that i was the most beautiful and perfect girl in the world to him now i pretend my pillow is his hand as i cry myself to sleep i failed him i was insecure and had intimacy issues and i never told him how he was the most beautiful man in the world he was everything he had led such a hard and tragic life but still he found the strength in himself to take care of everyone he cared for including me when i told him my father had sexually abused me i expected him to run for the door instead he held me and told me that he accepted me and loved me no matter what and that i was still beautiful to him im sobbing remembering the unconditional love he gave me i cant exist without him i reach my arms out into the air sometimes when im trying to fall asleep hoping i can feel his arms around me again why didnt i tell him that i loved him why did i assume i would see him again i feel so guilty i just want to feel his love again and to smell him as he hugs me he gave the best hugs in the world i just want to die and be with him again i want to tell him that i love him shanei love you im so sorry you died alone and that i wasnt there im sorry you died feeling like no one loved you because i do if only i had shown you what was in my heart maybe you would have stayed im sorry i love you with all of my heart i know you wanted me to live but i cant without you you were the only one for me but i was too stupid to let you in ill see you soon my love which is the first time ive called you that cassie,pre-pandemic

it really irritates me that the word trigger or triggered has been turned into a joke and a meme and people just casually throw it around whenever something is mildly inconvenient then when i try to explain to people what my triggers are they treat it as if im just being overdramatic because of the contexts in which they normally see the word it makes me feel selfconscious about asking someone not to do something because its triggering since i worry that people who dont know what i have been through will assume im just an overly sensitive person who needs to get over it,pre-pandemic
so many of us feel stuck in our heads so get of your head and into your body magazine article link think of exercise as medication says john ratey md an associate clinical professor of psychiatry at harvard medical school for a very small handful of people with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder adhd it may actually be a replacement for stimulants but for most its complementary something they should absolutely do along with taking meds to help increase attention and improve mood rat studies show that exercise reduces learned helplessness in fact if youre aerobically fit the less likely you are to learn helplessness so im just curious 1if you are working out how has it helped you 2 if not why arent you working out yet,pre-pandemic
on the journey of intervention now the daughter is almost eight changed a lot since she was 25 we knocked every door and still knocking the well known remains language and social deficits that have shrunk in that period we are very happy school inclusion should be a fact of intervention we fought public schools and are getting what we want we are rather a poor family where paying for programs and books have been an obstacle we have borrowed printed and the like we still need one particular book everyday classroom strategies and practices for supporting children with autism spectrum disorders written by jamie d bleiweiss phd lauren hough msed and shirley cohen phd i have read a preview of it but could not find the rest it is an excellent book that put a certain inclusive classroom s practice with particular emphasis class organization teachers roleetc the book provides the structure or bones of the asd nest program along with the story of how it was created a sampling of the content of the program and a general picture of how it was doing a description of the students served by the asd nest the professional development program that undergirds the asd nest the challenges in sustaining an inclusion program for children with asd within a large urban school system and the voices of parents of children served by this program are also included in that book i highly recommend it from the preview i signaled above to be able to devise implement and monitor the school as regards the sincere implementation of this crucial inclusive education for children of autism this program is not in any way the only or the most applied practice i remain to see how it works as respect my daughter other programs could benefit other children the bottom line is actually how a program is implemented to provide for the particular needs and strengths of every child in the end i hope if anyone could tell me of a download link where i can have that book or a cheap version of it you can pm on this issue and any other thing you want to know from my almost 6 years of diligent work i am sorry for the long message thank you and best regards,pre-pandemic

growing up i was always a really weird kid i distinctly remember that i had just seen the world differently it seemed that my imagination had a bigger play in my life than most me and a friend in kind garden would squeeze batteries in our hands and pretend that we were mario or pokmon because neither of our families couldwould buy us a game console but we were exposed to them by relatives and tv it was so simple back then and looking back so pure but it felt like we were there we didnt have what other kids had to have fun so we became those things as far as i know i was a decent enough kid however when my brother came along around age 4 we would fight i would hurt him not bad typically young brother bs but still enough to get beaten from my father when he got off work my father more so was he is still with us a rigid traditionally hispanic in parenting angry regretful person when he was in the house there was always a strange energy of danger even if nothing was going on it was better to just stay quiet this didnt really work because my younger brother soon learned that it was an easy win when wed bicker to just cry out loud our dad would come in beat my ass and i would curse my brothers name for doing so but alas it would get me to stop my real last memory of child abuse before my teens is about 15 seconds of my dad putting me in a corner on the ground telling me if i wanted to fight to put my hands up and when i did to just shield myself he pummeled me with closed fists i was around 10 years old maybe give or take a couple years not sure i have terrible memory of most my life as i got older my brother and i actually started bonding he liked the way i started standing up to our dad no matter how bad i was beat down hes told me i inspired him my mom btw iswas awesome but didnt really do much except yell to stop from the sidelines or leave the room since she couldnt bear to watch i cant blame her not much negativity felt towards her for i know she unconditionally loves me and that mustve been a tough and traumatic experience for her as well moving forward im a decent student normally averaging around low as my brothers straight as if not 100s not much of a big deal there my mom started adding incentives once we grew into our early teens for every a we got in a semester shed give us like 10 dollars or something it was dope so we did well through out life i feel like i found connections that i would replace for my fathers love through friendship i grew very close and desperately wanted to fit in with my friends i would spend hours out of the house riding bikes around the neighborhood doing dumb lil kid shit but it was a really freeing time out i remember fast forward around when i was 14 my brother 11 my mom bought me a bass guitar because i had been getting into random enough japanese rock from the anime i would watch and to me the bassist was always the most bad ass and going crazy member my brother came along and she bought him a guitar spur of the moment figured it would help us bond it did it really did and i thank everything in this world for those times that followed because they were hands down the best years of my life i was a shitty bassist and soon transitioned over to wanting to be a singer and my brother excelled at guitar going onto be called a prodigy by everyone from teachers producers and most of the respected music industry people we would eventually encounter but at the time he was my little brother and being a fresh teen thought it would be wack to have my 11 year old brother in the band i started a couple bands the second one introducing my brother in as lead guitar this was a turning point back to family life my dad started to realize he was aging and i was starting to gain my testosterone fueled teenage body this didnt stop anything but only extended our fights into actual fights my dad a correction officer doing manual labor his whole life handed my ass to me every time all while telling me to kill myself and how no one loved me and i was a mistake nothing like this was said to my brother unless in terms of how ive manipulated him into becoming just like me i became a bit of a shitty protector of the house hold two accounts stick out immeasurably to me the first being funny kind of a call back to how my brother would yell for my dad to come my brother was upstairs and screamed tyler help dad just hit me in a blind fury i bum rushed my dad onto the floor commanded my brother to hold his arms down and pummeled him in his face chest balls anywhere i could hit before he brother free all while yelling the likes of it used to just be me thats where you shouldve left it it was a powerful moment my father spent the rest of the week walking downstairs like a caged tiger screaming and laughing about how he was going to kill me twas still a sweet victory no fear ill speed up the rest me and my bro made a band everyone betrayed us we made another and took full control of who was in it wrote all the music what we looked like who we recorded with and what not with his help i created a two year plan to get signed to a label called fearless records we played metal it was therapeutic and empowering stuff to play after everything youve read thus far we did it in four months i got a text by our newly acquired manager that we had been offered a deal by the label of our dreams i cried and got sent home early a record that i wrote all the lyrics to and my brother wrote all the music to all fueled by the hate and distinction of our father son dissonance it was the biggest victory a small town probably has seen at least our small town every time he said we were garbage we should try something else i couldnt sing and my brother should play something nice every time he laid a hand on us put into songs and we did it in four months still makes me proud to this day man btw this isnt a story about my father he is not the reason i want to kill myself anymore the label fucked us over made us record 3 different records each time hating something that they previously wanted and we called it quits our deal was good n no need to recoup anything just disband this is where whatever is inside me to this day was brought into this life a foe i dont know if i can beat this time throughout the story so far i had a flame inside of me the whole time a purpose to prove a will to fight i always told people that i wasnt sad i was angry and the anger forged who i was a determined skill ful musician with the mane of a lion and the attitude to match a man who did it but when that all went away i became a worm but not yet shit with my dad cooled off he retired im assuming his job really was the culprit of the aggression and i stopped holding the past against him at this point i had been a dumbass at points too and figured it was not worth the energy or the negativity of keeping that cloud around was he still an incredibly ill informed ego centric prick yeah but i was a different person now and couldnt be bothered with it most times shrugging off his comments i had worth now me and my bro made another band with just our drummer from the previously signed act but it didnt last long we did an all over the place ep that was uninspiring yet everyone we showed loved it drummer left became a solo artist hes a whole other story i cant help but feel as tho im responsible for his and my brothers mental state as im 34 years older than both of them i was always the dad figure to them fuck it tho rock n roll we did it once well do it again me and my brother move to los angeles california in hopes of creating a new sound within the fusion realm of rap emo metal and pop genres we moved with two of my friends from ny and got a shitty two bedroom apartment and split the rooms the other two room mates were supposedly friends for years yet fought constantly shit talked each other and created this crazy negative space in this 1000 sqft it was not comfortable to say the least however the one room mate in specific targeted my brother who at this point basically didnt talk to either of them this is point one and point 2 is my confesssion and then there was me i had developed an alcohol problem not that i drank every day or even every weekend but when i did i became a different person i would usuallly drink myself to sleep as well my brother picked me up from a bar one night and while on his way i began to get robbed i refused it and tried to buy time and ended up running to his car when he got there amped on on about 10 jack n cokes and the adrenaline of potentially dying i flipped shit on my brother cursing him out saying i didnt need him i could pay someone 20 dollars to do what he does etc it was awful and it was the last straw for him within the next week or so he packed up quit his job and went back home i was heartbroken but covered it up with anger my other two room mates if you can believe it convinced me that i didnt need him and that he held me back i thought id be okay and hed come back i left our room exactly how he left it for months he didnt this was the final nail in the coffin for my mental state to date i spend every night analyzing the past and i think ive learned that at first i created a whole identity to hating my father then after that i created a whole identity around me and my brothers music career and once he was gone and to this second of typing it im lost i dont know what to do my personality feels like its splitting some days im this really cool extroverted ladies man guy and some days im a worm in my bed spending money he doesnt have on post mates so he doesnt have to leave the apartment when i sit down and try to write music i can but i dont feel it anymore its the only skill i have i didnt go to a real college because of the deal im not good at anything and im not interested in anything other than music but theres no inspiration left in me nothing really makes me happy anymore i had a gf nothing broke up with her nothing i have a new one i miss her sometimes but for the most part nothing i have written 6 new songs nothing i post a photo on instagram nothing i go to work nothing i watch a movie nothing everything just seems so pointless now i dont see myself as the star i once did i dont even believe myself when i sing or have conversation with people its like im watching the most boring movie about someone that i just dont even care about i just want him to die i just want to stop wondering and working and fighting i dont want to do it anymore and i was the relief of death idk what i expect from this but it was slightly therapeutic thanks for listening,pre-pandemic

im on a throwaway because my main is watched by my irl familyfriends this could be sexual tmi so just a warning im so tired of being bipolar i know this is a statement thats bland and cliche but its the truth im bipolar 2 and my hypersexuality is the worst i am constantly thinking about sex and everything involving how to get it i cant sleep at night without being turned on hoping the person sleeping next to me is secretly jerking off every room i walk into i immediately wonder who thinks im hot and who could i get in bed my relationships fail because i cant provide the loyalty relationships require because my attention is widespread and doesnt discriminate against anything age gender marital status for the love of god anywhere and everywhere i go im thinking about being bent over and railed from behind by nearly anyone and everyone i see im on medication and the meds are great at keeping everything else regulated but on or off meds the hypersexuality doesnt stop slow down or even pause for a hot minute and my brain is so tired of thinking about it some people dream of having a high sex drive because medications take theirs away but im at the point that if it was possible id donate my sex drive and all the things that are associated with it,pre-pandemic
sometimes mental health communities can have a tendency to validate and normalize behaviors and ive noticed the term favorite person is one of them the real meaning is codependent relationship fixating on another person and using them for validation an anchor and emotional regulation isnt healthy of course some support in a close relationship is normal but theres a point where someone desires constant contact and support and it becomes toxic if you constantly rely on a person to feel better youre not learning the skills it takes to improve youre going to overwhelm them sometimes or tire them out because no one can meet all of your needs all the time when theyre not there to help you feel better youre going to feel abandoned helpless and alone this was a really important realization for me its not a normal part of borderline its negative and harmful behavior for both parties were predisposed of course im not saying to just up and dump your fp just maybe acknowledge that it would be healthier if you focused on meeting your own emotional needs more setting boundaries using more coping skills or calming activities shutting off your phone for a couple hours or taking a long bath maybe this doesnt ring true for everyone and its hard to accept but i just thought this is an important subject and id like to discuss it,pre-pandemic
one year ago today i was sitting in some dirty run down trap house in a tiny bedroom with other addicts helping my boyfriend try and find a good vein in my arm to shoot up in this was my day to day reality i still cant believe just how fast and hard crystal meth took me down ive struggled with addiction for over nine years until about two years ago my drugs of choice were alcohol and cocaine ive never tried things like heroin or fentanyl because my thing when im high is i want to feel energized and awake i stopped using both alcohol and cocaine however when i was introduced to meth meth was like nothing id ever experienced before the first time i used i shot up the rush it gave me was unlike anything id ever felt before i felt it from my scalp to my toes i loved it i decided right there that this was what i wanted this was all i wanted anyways within the first month of getting hooked i sold all my electronics and most of my clothes just to get my next high i was dating a man at the time who was conveniently a meth dealer and so i would also get plenty for free from him it was awful i stopped eating i stopped bathing except for when i could no longer stand the awful stink that was coming off of me i had to force myself every few days to take things like xanax or benzos just so that i could sleep and stop the extreme paranoia and auditory hallucinations it took being sent to the hospital after my boyfriend beat me for the fifth time to decide that i wanted to quit after that i took a long look at myself and where id ended up in life i guess the reality of how awful things were finally hit me and i had a complete breakdown i checked myself into detox shortly after and ive been sober ever since ive joined a support group and we have meetings a few times a week ironically the area where i now attend these meetings to help me stay sober is the same area i used to get high in its the most dangerous part of the city walking through there now that i am no longer using is really shocking and makes me sad people often ask if its triggering for me and why dont i just go elsewhere for help my answer is that i find in empowering to be able to walk around there and not use it shows me just how strong i really am i think that if i can stay sober around there i can stay sober anywhere maybe 4 months isnt actually a lot of clean time but to me its a huge accomplishment for the first time in a very long time i feel like i actually have a shot at a good life like yeah maybe i can do this i cant say for sure that this is it and that ill never relapse addiction is the biggest struggle in my life and i cant predict the future what i am sure of though is that for today im choosing sobriety and if i keep working hard ill never have to pick up drugs again,pre-pandemic
pounding heart when youre sick its doing a good job fast heart rate during a hot shower its doing a good job pounding heart when exercising its definitely just doing a good job x200b ive noticed that my heart has many different behaviors and the cardiologist has said im alright at this point i think the most informed bet the occams razor is that my heart is just doing what its supposed to our bodies do not stay in one state they change in a million ways for a million different reasons every day ive started trying to think of my body as a compensation machine not in terms of covering up unhealthiness but in terms of youre healthy if your body is all over the place because its constantly adjusting to your current state bodies are systems that adapt in real time,pre-pandemic

a stigma that ive noticed in the mental health community so many people are happy to talk about it and embrace your differences but oh no dont have a panic attack in front of them dont seek reassurance from todays anxious thoughts and jitters this is something that needs changing it is more than ok for someone with diabetes to be comforted even when their their blood sugar gets too low and it affects their work even if the circumstances of the blip in their health was due to poor diet or a rough week i had a coworker that had this happen at work but when i struggled with low mood i was told we all have days like that dont let customers see you unhappy or uncomfortable this is an issue with how subjective everyday anxiety and a chronic mental health issue is if someone does not understand the effort it takes to behave normally they will default to judging you based on how they deal with it of course its not all bad im lucky to have family and a handful of friends that have seen me go though treatments and recovery so know the full spectrum of my issues and do not judge or baby me i felt like sharing this little rant to hear your thoughts on if youve been accepted or told to hide symptoms from the public to spare their discomfort like your doing it on purpose,pre-pandemic
it has been the hardest but most rewarding time in my life so far after a heavy few years of battling with cocaine addiction and alcoholism im happy today to say im recovering one day at a time 500 days ago i rocked up to a rehab centre jobless having everyone finally giving up on me it was my last chance id lost the will to live it couldnt be more different today everything i lost in my drinking and using i have gained 100 times over putting my head on the pillow clean and sober hasnt got old yet and i hope it never does to anyone struggling out there it does get better with a little bit of honesty and work on yourself,pre-pandemic
so i was standing in line at the pharmacy yesterday picking up an albuterol inhaler and some prescribed extra vitamins for my girlfriend who is almost 9 months pregnant due in 7 weeks that she needs to keep her levels good and as a recovering heroin addict its been a little under 14 months clean for me and at this point in my life its changed so drastically half the time i dont even notice the things i used too people obviously buying drugs needles on the ground and getting triggered whatever it may be 14 months ago i was in a jail cell throwing up myself from heroin wd while having benzo wd seizures and here my life is today its like that wasnt even my life do any of you ever get that feeling like damn i actually used to do all that stuff for a shot of dope but no need to reexplain my story its been told so im standing in line and a guy walks up next to me and asks if he can buy two 10 packs of 29 gauge needles obviously very drug addicted with his girl standing 30 feet away all sweaty and just you know that that person is addicted to dope look anyways the pharmacy tech said all we have is 29 gauge and he goes thats fine thats fine i just need two 2 packs now in my state pharmacies are required to sell up to 5 10 packs of needles and give free narcan if asked and i just kind watched and listened do his transaction pacing back and forth and it hit me ah ha that feeling where you think you yourself my god am i grateful for the life im able to live today and not be that guy anymore because 14 months ago i was that junkied out guy buying needles at the pharmacy but it gave me one of the most gratifying feelings ive ever felt blessed grateful happy whichever word you wanna use i felt it knowing i was going to go back to my car pickup dinner for my pregnant girlfriend and i and bring it back to our home knowing i wasnt going to wake up sick tomorrow it just in that moment for some reason made me feel so grateful im no longer in that grip of addiction like that that i almost teared up i have super bad anxiety and im super nervous to even post this because im afraid im but doing it i also in no way am saying ha sucks for that guy if i could i wish i could walk up to him and say hey man i can help you into detox you dont have to live like this but we all know we dont get clean unless we are personally truly ready so i guess i just wanted to make a gratitude post and let anyone and everyone know that is still struggling in active addiction just getting clean going through wd right now it gets better i promise im living proof with the iv habit i had i should be dead 5 times over but im here to make this post getting clean was the hardest choice i ever had to make and i had to hit a bad rock bottom to get clean for myself and its not easy if you can medically detox yourself please please do if you cant even if its just to get through the worst of the wdd have a suboxone or 3 on hand and maybe some clonidine or a low low dose of a benzo for the sleeplessness and rls will help tremendously we are all here for you the hardest part subsides physically within a week maybe 2 the mental part will always be an uphill battle but always a battle worth fighting this sort of turned into a rant just from seeing a guy buy needles that made me feel grateful i never have to do that again but if this reaches even 1 person im happy its hard i dont sugar coat things its not easy but the rewards you reap by getting clean and changing and building a new life are unimaginable we can and do recover happy holidays everyone merry christmas eve,pre-pandemic

quick info been to the er probably 7 times since march of 2018 due to nearly every symptom you find when you look up anxiety heart attack and angina chest painpressure left shoulder paindiscomfort lightheadedness shortness of breath clammy handsfeet etc each time they do an ekg xrays and blood work that shows no sign of heart attack or damage to heart muscle i even had a nuclear stress test done in august 2018 that came back negative as well to this day i still experience the symptoms but as of the past week the pain in the left side of my chest has been more constant and sharp ive also been experiencing increased tingling and numbing from my right hand that extends all the way to the right side of my face that lasts for a minute or two and then goes away another thing i will add is that i am a heavy drinker i dont drink every day but tend to go on binges that last several days i am sure my alcoholism could be contributing to my condition but i will still have these symptoms even on the days in between even when i havent drank for weeks on end it doesnt seem feasible to keep going to the er and getting stress tests especially when i am uninsured at what point do you just submit and tell yourself that if youre going to have a heart attack or stroke just let it happen to get it over with who else can you talk to to get a definitive answer on what exactly is going wrong inside your body,pre-pandemic

im a 15 year old addict from florida this is my story my spelling is really bad im sorry hey im reaching out because i feel stranded i used to feel lonely but now im separated from my family my friends and im sitting in iss at my boarding school in utah i feel so weak and hopeless at this point i feel like im crazy im fucked in the head so my using began about two years ago i was in 7th grade when i smoked weed for the first time i was with some older friends of mine at the time and we were smoking at the community playground late at night for my first time i ended up taking two bong rips and packing a few bowls i coughed for what seemed like 10 minutes after the coughing had ended i had finally felt the effects i was high really high and i loved it i felt lifted i was happy and we were all having a great time we all hung around the park laughing with each other for about an hour and then we decided to go back to their house where we would be spending the night this friend of mine also happened to be my little sisters friends older brother when we walked into the house we all reeked like bud my eyes were red and i was paranoid as fuck while walking back into the bedroom i had tripped over the dog gate that was separating the two sides of the house my sister and her friend came out of their room and they knew something was up at this point i was scared so i came clean to my sister and she called my dad my dad came picked me up brought me home and then shaved off all of my hair as a punishment this was just the beginning after this punishment i had been scared to ever get in trouble for drugs ever again so i finished that school year and the next without ever touching anything and it wasnt until freshman year of highschool that i had started to begin vaping nicotine i continued to do solely only use nicotine for about another month then i started to vape thc and use wax carts like every other highschooler in america i would get high every day before my sports practices games when i woke up in school before bed it was constant i began to see myself differently i became more depressed than i already was and my using that was recreational and social soon became a way of self medicating i began to drink alcohol every single day i would steal from convienent stores and my dads liquor cabinet i would get crossfaded every single day with no regard whatsoever and on christmas eve i got so drunk under my moms supervision that she had temporarily lost custody of me and my sisters the drinking and smoking went on for about another 5 months and then i started to experiment with lsd and i began to abuse that me and my friends went on an acid binge for about a week over winter break we all fell in love with acid at this time and we had said that it changed our lives but on the last day of this binge i had my first bad trip this experience was horrorfying my vision consisted of a kaleidoscope made up of faces that had red eyes and sharp teeth staring at me i was extremely paranoid and i was scared out of my mind this 12 hours of madness changed me forever fast forward about another month or so i continued to drink and smoke daily alongside the usual vaping and then one night i had ran away from home as a result of my dad posting an embarassing picture of me online with my dilated pupils staring into the camera i walked about 7 miles to an abandoned house that me and my homies would hang out at i ended up getting a ride to my other friends house from one of my dealers and then that next day me and my friend whos house i stayed at that night went to school the next day and i had my cart on me as usual along with some bud it was in 4th period that two cops and the hall monitor showed up to my classroom and asked to speak with me they brought me down to their office where they had told me there was a report of me having illegal drugs on campus i was searched and i was found with the bud and the cart i was expelled from all of the schools in my county and i was going to be brought down to the juvenile assesment center for my arrest of possesion of a controlled substance where i would get my mugshot taken along with all my finger prints etc etc but i had told the transporter that i was depressed and that i was thinking about killing myself i was brought down to the local hospital where i stayed in the mental health unit for 5 days then brought to get my assesment done right after that then brought to a real mental health hospital when i told the lady doing my assesment that i wanted to die i was in this hospital for 8 days where i slept on the floor for 5 of the days since i was on suicide watch on the 7th day i had received a phone call from my mom she told me that i was ordered to go to rehab by the court i left for rehab on my 8th day and i was in residential treatment for 7 weeks i left rehab and i was then going to be living with my grandparents temporarily i wasnt in school at this time and i started to work i was working two jobs one as a dishwasher and the other being a construction job i was on a probation program and i was going to be getting tested monthly i got around this by using otc drugs such as dph dxm and dramamine i didnt really like these drugs but i had used them since it was all i could get figuring that i didnt have a cell phone and i was living in a different area i also picked up cigarettes instead of vaping i prefer smokin cigs since its more of a ritual and i felt like it soothed me i would continue to overdose on benadryl every single night i began to develop a high tolerance for dph and i wouldnt be able to sleep at night if i didnt take at least 15 of them i ended up having a severe panic attack that resulted in me running away from my grandparents house to a neighbors house asking to use their phone so that i could call my mom my mom came and picked me up and i went on to live with her for about two weeks we were going to aa meetings together and i made it seem like i was getting my shit together this was a lie since i was starting to use dxm nightly smoke and drink daily and then start to use acid again this resulted in me running away again and putting myself into the mental hospital i stole two scripts of gabapentin from my moms friend and a box of zzzquil from a gas station and i took the entire box of zzquil and 1500mg of gaba when the cops had found me sitting outside the hospital i was bakeracted for 7 days this time and afterwords i had finally gone back home to my dad while i was living with my dad i had a cell phone and i had began to get my connections back alongside new connections i started seeking out more drugs harder ones i started to abuse everything i was abusing amphetamines like adderall and vyvanse xanax molly acid various painkillers dilaudid percs oxys tramadol hydros vicodin otcs dph dxm dramamine cocaine i experimented with heroin and spice at one point and i had done other drugs unintentionally like mda nbome and im sure a few others i was going to places that i didnt want to be i started selling drugs to pay for my habbit and i was robbing people when i was broke but i can always find a way to get high no matter where i am or how much money i had i would crush up stolen medication and my own medication and i would snort those to get a dirty pharma high i would take a shit ton of benadryl with my painkillers to potentiate them i would mix anything and everything regardless of the risks associated with it as long as i got the best high i became an addict i ended up committing some serious crimes where i had stabbed a local dealer i vandalized a kids house doing 14k in damages i was hurting myself and the people around me i was back in school and then that had only lasted about two weeks until i got kicked out of that school when i popped two bars and drank half a bottle of wine the night prior and showed up hungover as a result of all this i was sent to a wilderness therapy program in southern utah i was there for 11 weeks and i just got out last thursday this was my longest time being sober and it was for 78 days i have torn apart my family and put them at risk i disrespected my girlfriend and her family by selling drugs out of their house i have become even more ill and unstable and at times i cant even trust myself im struggling with my identity and i feel so lost im too scared to come out as bisexual to my parents and to the people at my school i feel like i cant talk about the voices that i hear in my head while im alone i feel like im way to

so basically i tried to do it a couple of months ago had everything prepared was ready to just end it all until all of a sudden i got way too scared and decided to call it off my mom saw the letter that i was supposed to leave and went behind my back showed it off to her friends and some family members then talked to me about it i became some sort of beacon of attention which i hated people telling me that itll get better or saying if it was true sometimes i kinda wished i wasnt such a pussy and ended it right then and there couldve saved myself from embarrasment,pre-pandemic
i have a year and a half off of heroin up until this weekend my craving were few and far between basically if i saw someone using on a movie or had a memory of an old event the thought of using would quickly pass through my mind and leave this weekend was a little different though i felt anxious and just generally crappy and i had an intense urge to get high the thought instead of quickly fleeting was burning through my mind i had the money my son was at his dads for the weekend so i had the opportunity i was like 85 sure i was going to pick up the phone and call my dealer i even scrolled through snap chat to see if i still had him in my friends list while scrolling on snap i accidentally swiped over to the stories list and saw my little brother had posted on his story so i decided to go hang out with him and his girlfriend instead i am so happy that i was able to find the strength to pull away from that urge it was the first time in this year and a half that i was that close to relapsing thank you for reading this i cant talk to my family about things like this they dont understand addiction and if they find out i had a craving they will be worried and they will think that im going to relapse any minute when in fact i think this experience made me stronger currently cleaning up the house with a smile on my face,pre-pandemic

i dont know what to say or do i just feel like my life is falling apart three weeks ago my apartment was broken into by 4 strangers my girlfriend was sleeping over it was an awful horrific long night and she witnessed every single thing 8 hours of prolonged humiliation and abuse these 4 strangers destroyed me they shredded every bit of selfesteem and sanity i had after the hell they put me through they simply left me there bleeding heavily and stunned my girlfriend was tied up screaming but i didnt move it took me a while to comprehend that this is now my reality and eventually get up weeks later i am paranoid unable to look at my reflection without feeling disgust and i spend my time in my university lectures thinking about ending my life i didnt tell a single soul about this because i feel so ashamed i feel pathetic and weak my girlfriend is the only one that knows though everyone around has been telling me ive been ignoring them lately and calling me an asshole for it yet i dont care i just feel numb i want to die but im too afraid to say it out loud that night they not only violently violated me but they took something from me a piece of my soul anyways ever since that night my girlfriend has been acting different she treats me differently touches me differently and most importantly she looks at me differently a few days ago while we were sitting together she told me that its alright if this experience turns me gay and that we dont have to continue dating this is coming from a 19 year old girl that has common sense it all just made me feel really bad it just reflected how after all this how disgusting i feel was valid that i am gross in her eyes now today is my birthday i turn 20 i bailed on all the plans and decided to spend it alone im sitting at home drinking alcohol and thinking about bashing my goddamn face in i just feel alone in a way i never felt before i just never thought this is where id be that this would be my life i hope im posting this in the correct place ive only had reddit when i was younger thanks for listening for whoever is out there hopefully ill feel better for writing this update 1 two of the assailants were caught by the police today ill post a more detailed update in the next few days thank you everyone for this support update 2 sorry im late with this ive just been going through a lot im gonna try to give everyone a bit of closure on everything thats went down the four assailants were part of a sex trafficking gang that my shitty dad got involved with and owed a lot of money im not comfortable sharing the details of this specific aspect but i hope this general explanation is enough two of them were caught and will be most likely going to prison as they plead guilty to avoid a trial im currently trying to get myself together but things have been getting worse and worse mentally ive been going to gym jogging and trying my best to not lose it i didnt start therapy but im considering it me and my girlfriend broke up and theres no bad blood i just need to focus on myself and again thank you everyone for the immense support youve given me you have no idea how much it saved me and made me feel a little less alone thank you,pre-pandemic

for context my dad gets me a grande cafe misto with almond milk and sf caramel 48 kcal and lovely pretty much every single day since its like my one source of comfort during the day the local drive through sbs has gotten it wrong on occasion leading to a lot of tears etc a few months ago he explained to the woman whilst waiting that i had pretty severe an hence why he always had to double check that everything was perfect otherwise it could be majorly upsetting for me she sympathised and said shed watched her sister start to slip into a potential restrictive disorder but thankfully she hasnt spiraled too far anyway now a few of the baristas know my order off by heart and why it has to be so specific he was waiting today while they brewed the filter and the person at the window explained they actually only let those specific people make my drink who know how why because they dont want to upset me and want to make sure its always correct he came home and had the above message written on my cup and it just really made my day it was really nice knowing how thoughtful they are and understanding sorry for the ramble i just have nobody to share this with and i found it really sweet x200b x200b edit thank you everyone i forwarded on the comments to my dad will also write to sb to name the branch hopefully theyll get some worthy praise 3 also my dad has been incredible he has aspergers but the lengths he goes to to empathize with me is something ill always be thankful for sadly weve both had to go through this disordered journey over the past year or so but hes very supportive as stated i forwarded on everyones compliments,pre-pandemic

hey guys ive been lurking on this sub for a long time but ive never posted anything i just try to comment on posts to provide reassurance when i can without asking for it in return the past several months have been absolute hell for me symptoms on symptoms on symptoms some psychosomatic some very real multiple visits to my pcp turned into a referral to an endocrinologist which ended up being unsuccessful in finding answers i had a parathyroid issue back in 2018 that was resolved with surgery but ever since then any and every symptom has me losing my mind thinking that it is all connected somehow it was a benign tumor on my parathyroid causing hyperparathyroidism let me just go ahead and say that i am doing everything in my power to treat my anxiety medicine genesight testing weekly therapy yoga self help books you name it anyways i have been completely fixated on my head and eyes the past couple months i have pretty bad eye straindry eye accompanied by tension and sinus headaches i tried everything to get rid of them but they werent budging at all and only getting worse around christmas i accepted my fate and came to terms with the fact that i absolutely 100 have a brain tumor you could not convince me otherwise all day every day my thoughts were consumed with it i havent been able to function at work socially physically emotionally etc i completely lost my appetite due to the anxiety of it all which resulted in weight loss which scared me even more fast forward to today i got up and was nauseous as soon as i woke up just another symptom of the brain tumor i thought i pushed through and made it until about 10 am until i started getting super dizzy and nauseous at my desk i could barely see straight or focus on anything i couldnt take it anymore and i got up and left super out of character for me and asked my mom to meet me at the emergency room i am terrified of hospitals i have been one time in my life before todayemergency rooms terrify me i got to the er and only had to wait about 20 minutes to be seen i told the doctor what was going on with my head and a few other things and she was incredibly kind and understanding she immediately ordered a ct scan loads of blood work and a urinalysis in my mind i was like okay this is it they are finally going to find it and i can start treatment and just get this show on the road i was terrified but i also felt this sense of relief knowing that i was about to have answers after all these months a couple hours pass and i am a hot mess waiting for all my results finally the doctor came in looked at me with a smile and said normal as can be normal every single test including the head ct was completely normal she walked through all my results with me i cannot even explain the feeling that i experienced when she said that guess what else happened the headache stopped the nausea stopped the dizziness stopped it all juststopped my point is health anxiety is real the symptoms are so real when youre in the moment or going through a bad health anxiety flare up theres no way it can all just be anxiety it has to be an underlying health issue right thats what my mindset was but i was so wrong and i can venture to say that you are wrong about your scary symptoms too if you have been checked out by a doctor and they assure you that you are healthy believe them they paid a ton of money and spent a lot of time to be able to correctly diagnose patients ps this sub has been a lifesaver for me,pre-pandemic

disclaimer this is something i wrote in response to someone who wants to pull funding from gifted programs around the world i wont be doing a tldr unless you ask me too and i am not rewriting this because im in a shitty mood thanks in part to my adderall practically curing my adhd and lifting that fog for the last few months which has allowed me to reflect on my entire life and with help dig deep and rediscover myself with profound revelations i now know how fucked i was this treatment and therapy has been so breathtakingly amazing i cant believe i spent 10 years without treatment i just wish i had done so earlier and been supported by good people during that time as well here goes start i hate people like you i went through school thinking i was the idiot my iq is over 180 and is probably immeasurable but i felt stupid because everyone i have ever met outside of europe especially in the united states always says something similar children would benefit from learning how to be respectful and how to be humble something as a whole they seem to be lacking my parents my family my classmates society in general etc i wish i had stayed in europe they bent over backwards to accommodate my specific needs and because of such early help might be the only reason im able to overcome all the trauma you average idiots did to me i dont know what the logic behind that asinine thinking is i dont know whether truly gifted kids make average people feel like idiots and because theyre just smart enough to be selfaware they get offended like a bunch of downs kids with iqs 50 trying to figure out a problem and an average person comes by and without even thinking about it just does it in front of them now shift that so the downs kids are average and you might be able to conceptualize just how goddamn smart these kids are is that scary because it makes you look stupid ill put it in another way i am so intelligent i have broken all testing to the point i cant be tested they dont work which by the way psychological testing breaks at 130149 that youd have to adjust the downs kids to 130149 and make the same shift towards more intelligent to find me it might also be worth noting by shaming people for being smart you are limiting the abilities and forcing highiq individuals to conform to your society your way of life your ideas of whats right and wrong when these kids are so far in advance of anything you can think of there is no conceivable way you could understand yes these kids have sometimes severe idiosyncrasies its a part of being extremely intelligent but despite your limited comprehension they do not care for the same things you do and are most likely the least racist least judgmental naturally humble friendly emotionally stable people that exist ive only recently been getting the help to untangle the web of average lies and bs meant to keep me in line and am beyond furious at how i was treated you cant put gifted kids in public school if you do you are putting the best of our society in a system that is completely incapable of teaching or handling them in a sense we are like retards and they get their own funding because you cant have retards in normal curriculums and considering that gifted individuals are just as far from average as the retards are from average doesnt it make sense that normal curriculum is unsuitable for them as well and limiting throw in the great unwashed large class numbers these kids gifts get drowned out and they spend a lifetime dealing with the aftermath i hope you have a gifted child so you can watch him grow up in public school so you can watch as your sons talent and intelligence is nuked in your public schools and watch as they grow up and realized how you fucked them because that kid will most likely disown you and the irony is that youll never understand why end if you have any question feel free to pm me or just comment thanks for listening,pre-pandemic
i met these new guys a month ago and they asked me if i wanted to hang out i said definitely because they were the cooler kids and i dont have a lot of freinds i asked my mom to drop me off and she brought the whole family to drop me off and then they were gonna do there thing i texted him beforehand asking if we were still hanging he said yep i pull up in front of his house and then he texts me never mind its been canceled it was so embarrassing my whole family was in there while i am frantically trying to get info on why its not happening after like ten minutes my parents say we have to go i come back home after a really sad and check snapchat stories and there they are all of them having the time of their life they lied to me and i would be lying if i said i didnt cry i really got to stop giving my trust into people and now i came here telling reddit about how shitty my day was dont really know if anybodys gonna read this i just wanted to put it down,pre-pandemic
this is probably gonna be a wall of text since i just wanna get it all of my chest if you guys just came here for my question instead of the background info scroll down to the bold text at the bottom okay so heres the story i 22m have been struggling with all sorts of crap since primary school i was notoriously late the worst when it came to doing chores and always procrastinating and holding off things i needed to do untill the very deadline you all know what its like i read this exact story written by different people countless times here totally baffling when i first visited this reddit im not alone so i thought everyone on earth was having such a hard time doing mundane things i waded through the mud untill the senior year of highschool where stuff got harder and harder for me i eventually failed at maths physics chemistry so i had to do the year over this time i did get my diploma although i still failed maths with a 3710 and winged physics with 010 points away from failing again this time no retry available anyways the year after i went to my current college the academy of popculture and i think this is what saved me yet cursed me i always thought i wanted to do something with my hands and head create pretty stuff that was exactly what this school offered its extremely open and free the first year you get to follow a course but from the second year on you design your own projects you think of what you want to learn how you are gonna do it with whom and how you wanna be criticized by the teachers and the assessments this means alot of freedom and here is exactly where my problem arises when i pick a project and im working together with interesting people im working like crazy im thinking of awesome projects to do professional championships hide seek a band dedicated to performing next to the freeway at traffic jams i let my mind run wild at brainstorms create awesome stuff and make beautiful music with my band if im in the right flow when im not about 810th of the time i just always have this feeling that im underperforming and what is especially hard for me is the end of each semester i have to write a load of paperwork for the stuff i did and why i should receive my points i have been trying to get some points for 15 year now but im way behind always telling myself i can do it and each time i slap myself in the face and promise i will get some at the next assessments well we all know how that goes right i noticed i just started losing faith in myself its getting worse and worse in the beginning i was like i can do this shit lets get to it and i kind of winged it but now i feel like whatever i do its over my head and i wont ever graduate and i wont dare to think of my life afterwards but thank god i have the best girlfriend one could imagine apart from some desynchronised libido hehe but thats a whole other story she actually came up to me saying i might have add been reading up on it ever since and i all makes somewhat sense to me now dont know if this make sense but i can finally see what part of me is add and what part is actually me so warming to hear all you guys coming up with solutions stimulating eachother and all these recognizable stories all of them anyways after some deskresearch i figured i should go see a doctor made an appointment 6 months later yeah i know and she said i showed obvious signs of add but couldnt diagnose me herself so she sent me to a psychiatrist and this was 3 months ago i still need to make the appointment but im scared as fuck damnit or not even scared im actually anxious to go since i wanna do something about this crap im in i dont know why i dont do it its like all these conversations i had with people why im always late i do care about you and i dont know why im always late and i tried going to bed earlier that didnt work out damn you appointments damn you opening letters damn you days and days of just laying around in bed not wanting to get up damn you sitting behind your pc doing stupid shit while aching for bed but not going to bed till the sun starts to rise always when theres important shit coming up the next day damn you cold coffee damn you unanswered emails and goddamn you dishes although fuck yeah im happy i bought a dishwasher yesterday since i couldnt stand the frigging month old dishes my kitchen counter is empty now for the first time in years woo people look at me funny when i tell them i bought a dishwasher for myself that dude be lazy as fuck dont care much works for me but yeah im kinda frustrated as you guys might have noticed so after reading through this subreddit im actually aching to try medication or atleast seeking help but somehow this scares me too will my projects suffer from taking meds i totally rely on myself going from one crazy idea to the other and this is what i am actually being succesfull at will this go if it will i might just aswell leave school and quit filming and making music altogether i think ideas anyone experienced with this tldr so what i want is this the best of both worlds film day brainstorm day performing with my band i want my brain to run wild and go everywhere like everyone here knows the feeling close to a deadline with some pesky emails needing to be sent need to do some administration paying the bills or organising my projects in timetables or whatever can i then just take pills that help me concentrate on this dont procrastinate and get the stuff done i need to get done does it work that way i know these aint somekind of wonderpills i just wonder how flexible you can be with using them on and off got a long boring class i really need to pay attention to take an adderal to help me keep focused can i do this shouldnt i start getting meds in the first place with a job like the one i have id love to get some insights from someone please do tell me how much of an idiot i am for thinking it works that way but do elaborate im just reaching the point i have to do smething or im losing faith in my own abilities thanks in advance love you guys already,pre-pandemic
its weird ptsd changes you so much every once in awhile when im laughing really hard its like i feel like me againand that feeling makes me emotional cuz it feels like im hugging a good friend i hadnt seen in years,pre-pandemic
i suffer from ptsd from mutiple different things in my life but one of the most intense and horrifying to remember is when i was homeless for a year in america at least though im sure in other places as well once you become homeless or in poverty youre no longer a part of society youre not a member of society youre a burden a leech for needing anything anything at all even something as small as a listening ear or breadcrumb its an offense to even suggest you may need help to suggest that anyone should even consider helping you because in their eyes you must have done something to deserve poverty or homeless its like a moral branding to them it doesnt matter how you became severely poorhomeless and it doesnt matter how desperately youre fighting to surviveescape your circumstances poorhomeless is all they need to know to know that youre unworthy of help or of compassion youre the scum beneath their feet youre not even human even after being homeless and tormented for a year and then in poverty for 4 i still feel myself become crushed under the weight of peoples disgust for poorhomeless people it utterly shocks me it steals the breath from my lungs the internet is full of cruelty and anger obviously but its not just on the internet anyways not by a longshot people are not shy about their disgust for poor people and if you havent been in extreme poverty you may not have even noticed how bad it is you may have some deeply rooted hatred and judgement inside you too its horrifying and it brings me back to the most horrifying daysexperiences of my life i think i had a conclusion to this but i feel like a child again starving and absolitely terrified and being proven to that even the mostly seemly compassionate or kind people will turn on you the moment you have no money the moment you become worthless heres a conclusion i guess anyone else traumatized by povertyhomelessness or more specifically how people treated you because you were in povertyhomeless,pre-pandemic

i dont make my own reddit posts but i feel like i need to for other people a little background im a psychotherapist weird i know who has a sad history of health anxiety sometimes cancer but mostly devastating neurological diseases when i was in graduate school and i had very hard internship at a hospital i remember my first now looking back panic symptom that was odd my vision was blurry hm at my first therapy job i noticed eye pain as well now looking back i was very stressed and the florescent lighting is trash but i researched and wouldnt you know it eye pain is an ms symptom im a white woman in my 20s uhoh thats the main demographic im in trouble i keep googling and as i see symptoms i start to get those symptoms they dont come and go they are constant my face on one side and my arm on one side are numb all the time 4am numb i cry all the time go to neurologists have many tests rack up bills no ms i see a psychiatrist was prescribed lexapro and within a few weeks my life is back to normal shouldnt say this was simple because i cried for months and would vomit every morning out of sheer panic but its behind me i take the meds for 3 years then decide i can stop i should note that in between this event and the next i had smaller events and went to doctors for them always was nothing but then a year later something happens one day i notice my hand feels weird its like my typing is clumsy i spend 4 hours on als forums reading peoples experiences i watch youtube videos of diagnoses oh no this is it my muscles start twitching uncontrollably i have cramps in my legs in my hands every day i cry all the time i plan my death i tell my fianc he should probably move on that we shouldnt have the wedding because the money would be better saved for care i go to the doctor he says i seem fine he reads my medical records and sees i have health anxiety says i can see a neurologist if i want but itll probably be a waste puts me back on lexapro my fianc also insists that i start therapy i believe its a waste because im dying but fine every morning i wake up nauseous sobbing hands cramped i read and read and read i see my hand is smaller on one side im wasting away i lose lots of weight and can barely do any work i see a neurologist practically crawling to the office because i feel so weak when she tests my reflexes they are hyper another symptom i immediately burst into tears she tries to assure me that a lot of young people and anxious people have hyper reflexes but im hearing none of it we schedule an mri and have a follow up in a month the weeks waiting for the medication to kick in are brutal everyone needs to know that ssris have bad side effects in the initial weeks including increased anxiety i know right you have to understand that it takes a long time to build in your system you have to be patient this is where the therapy comes in we used cbt which really maps out your greatest fears the likelihood of that outcome and your ability to cope with that outcome we look at the facts i am not a doctor this is incredibly rare surely i wouldve gotten worse by now i dont feel my hand is messed up when im drinking alcohol my favorite health anxiety hackdrink and see if you still have the problem lol i start doing yoga in my office even though i suck at it because i just want to feel better selftalk is very dangerous you need to watch the messages youre playing in your head i told myself i know it i know over and over again its like your own personal health anxiety flavored brain washing i changed it to it feels like it feels like and like my therapist said feelings arent facts the 247 panic stops but im still worried i follow up with my primary he says ive gained some weight back and look a lot better i see the neurologist again and she notes the same i was prepared mentally for this appointment with an agenda i said i trust you if you say i should get an emg i will if you think i shouldnt i wont she said consider this a clean bill of health i dont think you need an emg i give her a hug thank her for being so kind and move on with my life i am not allowed to google this anymore point blank period i thanked my friends for dealing with me during this time and now i just cope with some bummer side effects from the lexapro but i dont care i have my life back my therapy moved to twice a month and i still take the medication my muscles twitch sometimes and oh well not as much as before more evidence that it was stress related logic is your friend i hope that you can pull some nuggets from this post including how symptoms can seem very real and yet not be real ill leave you with this one of my dearest friends also a therapist said to me you know youre really smart so your anxiety is smart too of course it picked a disease that you cant easily prove you dont have fin,pre-pandemic
months ago i was stuck in the darkest place i have ever been i did dope every day all day i would plan everything i did around using it wasnt even fun anymore i was just doing it to curb withdrawals i felt so fucking hopeless that i would never live a normal life again i was stuck and heroin had its grip on me after some time and some help from friends and family i discovered kratom kratom took away almost all of the withdrawals and i was able to get clean without being super sick after the first 34 days i was home free now here i am 150 days later no cravings or desire to go back to the hole i dug i left the ladder for you fuck heroin,pre-pandemic

so i have been wanting to post this here but have been putting it off because this is going to be long so bare with me if you want to know how i over came this bad disease keep reading if your ready to recover keep reading it all started when i was 16 nothing necessarily trigger this other then i got sick one time fever body aches and it had been a few years since i had a check up when my mom said you need to let me take you to the doctor for a check up because you wont know if somethings wrong of you dont so when i got sick i decided to google it to see what was wrong and leukemia was the first thing that popped up my heart dropped from that moment i was a google fanatic and thought i had every disease in the book i suddenly started experiencing symptoms of leukemia like fatigue and flu like symptoms the after that i was worried i had a brain tumor i had symptoms of that also this was the worst one for me i think i had a buzzing noise in my ear from time to time blurred vision fuzzy peripheral vision headaches pressure on the top of my head slurred speech sometimes nausea at time etc it was horrible the symptoms were real i was checked multiple times and i got a clean bill of health then i worried about skin cancer i seen a dermatologist who confirmed i do not have skin cancer i then found what i thought to be a lump in my abdomen and seen a doctor who said its nothing but she ordered a ct with contrast to shut me up that was clear as well but did say i had a very slightly enlarged spleen which could have been caused by mono when i was younger i had many blood panels ekgs echocardiograms ct scans xrays urine tests i saw a chiropractor a dermatologist and many mds before i finally decided to accept that this was a mental issue and im not ill it took me 5 long frustrating scary years before i agreed i had an issue with worrying over my health for no good reason i seen two counselors and they helped but i knew the change had to be within me i finally accepted the facts google is not the most reliable source in fact only 42 of the health info found on google is accurate so your pretty much seeking reassurance from a uneducated stranger rather then just seeing your dr and trusting their diagnosis its hard to agree these symptoms are in your head but they are you can make yourself feel all sorts of crazy symptoms so if youve seen a doctor and you have a good report the only thing you should be googling is health anxiety symptoms and making sure your on a reliable website such as webmd or mayoclinic steer clear of yahoo answers or any of the other forums that uneducated people post on trying to give advice in facts steer clear of google and the web period heres how i done it i scheduled a check up and wrote down all of my concerns i talked to my doctor about my issues with anxiety and how bad i was making myself worry he told me i need to stay far away from google all together and i followed his orders i had him do a full check up ekg blood work std testing you name it just to at last put my mind at ease once that was over and i was confirmed healthy i started finding stuff to do like working out surrounding myself with friends and i got a job i would leave my phone in the car locked up when i went into work for a period of time i only used my phone for calls and texts when i did have the urge to google id find something else to do like go for a walk and talk to myself about all the tests ive had after all of these test it would be very unlikely something so sinister would be missed i knew it was mental so i would be easy on myself cry if need be but dont check for lumps dont start letting your mind wonder keep yourself occupied at least for the first few weeks i would set new goals for myself like school work gym find someone you trust and talk to them about your problems like for me it was my mother work on improving your health eat healthy get enough sleep get a good amount of exercise each week and take a supplement and most of all remind yourself this is a mental thing when you start to worry and immediately distract yourself please keep in mind this is a process it didnt get this bad over night so it will not be fixed over night it will take time be patient with yourself talk to a counselor if you need to stop posting questions looking for answers because you wont find them here unless your looking for ways to over come anxiety if you believe in god pray often if you need medication take it personally i never wanted meds because i dont want to be dependent on them but if it helps you take it if you need a break from work take it put you first if your scared to see a doctor make the appointment and make yourself go for reassurance remember if god forbid something is wrong its better to find out and take care of it then ignore it and it get worse like high blood pressure for instance if you dont take meds it can potentially eventually damage arteries but its better to fix the problem and move on then to not do anything at all but no matter what google is not the answer if anyone needs to talk or has questions feel free to ask me i am pretty educated in the health field as ive done many years of research as well as school for registered nursing i have family in the medical field so if you feel you need to confide in someone dont hesitate to dm me and we can work though this together i dont want to see anyone waste years of their life like i did if i can help it xoxo,pre-pandemic

i am not saying that the victim is to blame nobody ever deserves abuse or anything less than the best in any relationship dynamic i do not think that people with ptsd are merely crying wolf over and over i want to clarify that so that people dont get the wrong idea below is merely my experience and i know a few friends with ptsdhistories of trauma have related to my experiences interpretations x200b ive realized that whether it be friends romantic partners even roommates i tend to find myself with people whom are narcissistic dont want to recover or take accountability for themselves people whom take advantage of me or whom are abusive i know that i dont deserve or want this treatment but i know that my ptsd often takes over and doubts the red flags i feel other people would react to or i allow many more boundary violations than i should essentially i feel as though the ways in which my ptsd has manifested causes me to allow really abusive manipulative etc people into my life whom i wouldnt otherwise give the time of day x200b does anybody else experience this its really started to fuck with my head and makes me wonder if my roommates claims most recent occurrence of this are true especially since hes started to be all buddy buddy with my other roommate since i put boundaries in place and i stopped tolerating his bs it does make me wonder if im just such a fucked up person that i dont even realize im fucked up if that makes sense,pre-pandemic

i spoke to my doctor she upped my latuda i picked up my benzos from the pharmacy i have been making myself get in bed with electronics off usually by 10pm im still in an episode but the huge symptoms that were making me almost needing to be hospitalized have gone down im safe im thinking more like myself and less like someone who has taken over my mind i appreciate you all sharing your stories it really helped me feel not alone and honestly it was brave for you all to do so i still am not brave enough to share what i did i also am so thankful for the checking in on me the making sure im okay the support you all poured out to me i really love you all,pre-pandemic
its not that im against people talking about mental health and feeling safe enough to open up and talk about it its the insincerity of what feels like everyone saying they care suddenly about mental health but its only ever depression or anxiety yes they are serious and can ruin and even kill lives we all know this it just sucks that there is no space to talk about bipolar schizophrenia schizoaffective bpd and other illnesses this may just be me being manic and really fucking pissed off but i feel its so insincere,pre-pandemic

so i have major ha and its mainly centered around heart issues im 100 convinced my panic attacks are heart attacks will deal with palpitations even though every cardiologist ever has said im fine etc etc yall know the drill i am constantly running to the doctor because i just know something is wrong with my heart and he tests me for everything and always says theres literally nothing wrong here so yesterday i was headed to brunch with some friends my chest starts hurting i start panicking i convinced myself that this was a heart attack since i have no anxiety whatsoever about seeing my besties for mimosas i tried to distract myself by laughing and joking with my friends and quietly tried to accept my fate that i will indeed die on this day from a heart attack luckily it was a short drive and we arrived at the restaurant before these thoughts could culminate more it wasnt until i got home that i realized the pain went away and i hadnt even thought about it since arriving at the restaurant the distractions of talking about the next episode of game of thrones gossiping about celeb scandals and trying to figure out which omelette to order had totally distracted me its experiences like these that show me just how anxious i really amhow strong my anxiety truly is its present when i dont even think it has a reason to be i wasnt having a heart attacki was having anxiety still dont know why as i was genuinely looking forward to brunch but thats just another thing i need to work through and understand my subconscious anxiety is causing these scary sensations those palpitations that come out of no where thats anxiety sharp chest pains that occur when im sitting down watching tv anxiety i dont have to be faced with a typical anxietyinducing event to struggle with the side effects of this disease sorry if this is obvious to everyone else but i hadnt really come to grips with this until yesterday felt like a huge realization for me and wanted to share in case it helps someone else,pre-pandemic
this morning my 28 f boyfriend 29 m died in my arms he was not feeling well the last few days and admitted last night that he was withdrawing from alcohol he was jaundiced but did not want to go to the hospital he was not sleeping well overnight and was physically very restless around 630am he went to take a shower but he was feeling weak so i told him to make sure he was sitting down in the shower he was taking longer than usual so i went to check on him and found him sitting on the edge of the tub dripping wet and delirious he was not making sense and saying things like you were in the shower etc i had to physically dry him off and walk him back to bed once back in his bed he was breathing very fast almost panting i told him we should go to the hospital and began to dress him and he said i dont deserve you he then had a seizure for about 30 seconds and was unresponsive with no pulse or breathing his roommate began administering cpr while emts were on their way they worked on him for about 20 minutes before telling us there was nothing they could do his body laid on his bedroom floor for about an hour i was able to sit with him and hold his hand and tell him how sorry i was this was happening police came and carried him away in a bag he is being examined tomorrow i will never feel his love or hold his hand or giggle with him again my heart is broken i just needed to write this out thank you all,pre-pandemic
i recently got diagnosed with adhd not to my surprise because ive had the biggest suspicion of it ever since i entered hs im a college student and its 434am and im up because im supposed to be doing homework for my class tomorrow but i streamed and watched videos for the past 6 hours i always stay up late because i feel like i could do something at the late hours of the night but i never do and i just end up going to sleep feeling like shit i was wondering if other people relate to this weird feeling to purposely avoiding sleep for no real reason,pre-pandemic
yesterday i tried to hang myself from a bridge with a belt and when i jumped i instantly regretted it i fought with all my strength to hold on to the rail but the belt was chocking me i tried screaming for help but my voice was too hoarse for anyone to hear me eventually my arms gave out and i started to dangle and suffocate i saw people in my life that had died and i saw all the great memories of my life flash before my eyes right as i was about to go out my leg began to swing up and reached a ledge it was my last strength i pulled myself up with my remaining core strength and leg strength so that i was parallel with the bridge this gave me room to breath again i swung my arm up and around the rail so that i could attempt to take the belt off and i knew i only had one shot at this i was successful but my body gave out after the belt was free and i dropped into the water the next day or today i have been reliving the moments that seemed to be my final moments and other ptsd symptoms and im not sure how i can deal with it anyone have anything that could help,pre-pandemic
you do not want this disease it contorts the way you think turns you against yourself makes you question literally everything around you and is mentally exhausting to keep up with it can severely impact our lives and often requires a lot of treatment and strong medication saying that you may be schizophrenic because youre random or because you do impulsive things is stupid i recognize that some people do have schizophrenia and talk about it lightheartedly but self diagnosing yourself and making jokes about it for attention is infuriating,pre-pandemic
as a lot of you probably are too this virus has been cause for some of my anxiety recently most of my anxiety regarding it is due to the world simply not knowing how to contain it so i decided to assume i will get it and look at it from a backwards standpoint statistically we see worrisome mortality rates and our minds wander i think they should be looked at differently according to worldometers for people aged 80 years the likelihood of making a full recovery is over 85 if youre a healthy 84 year old chances are youre fine and i cant imagine many of us here are that age not to mention from that age group and down the death risk diminishes drastically im still going to be worried about this as a lot of you will be too but because the media may be exaggerating and causing some hysteria i thought it would be nice to provide an uplifting statistic god bless,pre-pandemic
sorry for this shower thought but i thought it is actually a pretty good way of explaining anxiety,pre-pandemic
so sometimes when my so says he doesnt feel goodfeels sick ill start to look up his symptoms of course i dont talk to him about what i find bc its always nothing since we dont live together i get really worried that something is going to happenhappened literally every morning before he texts me since my heath anxiety got bad again i think its really stupid that my brain wont shut off even when i know everything is fine,pre-pandemic
does anyone else have this problem ive had issues with friends and significant others saying they support me until they actually see my mood cycles people always think youre not trying hard enough to get better when they dont see how bad you used to be or how many times a day you hold in an outburst also them thinking meds are a cure all and you should be better automatically after starting them when sometimes it takes months to tell,pre-pandemic
i get gassy crampy and sometimes full on runs just from being anxious my stomach will hurt and occasionally ill get heartburn only when im highly anxious i just wondered if anyone else gets this and cant think of anywhere id be more comfortable asking edit wow this blew up i had no idea this was such a common thing,pre-pandemic
not as bad as yesterday but still exhausted i also didnt know it was possible to sweat as much as i did today by 9 i looked like just jumped into a pool even my boots were soaked i also feel week almost like im actually sick which i know is from withdrawal im not gonna lie i want it i want it bad right now at lunch my only thoughts were of taking my pipe and smoking some but i cant i know i cant im tired of that poison i wont let it control mesomething strange also happened i swear i saw my uncle today at a market that i go to for lunch normally that wouldnt be odd but he died 2 years ago and i also keep hearing like this knocking sound like someone is knocking on my door even when im outside i hear it,pre-pandemic

this wont resonate with everyone im just posting here whats worked for me also trigger warning if youre not feeling strong dont read 1 disconnect from the diagnosislabel you are not your bpd you are simply a human being thats doing the best you can 2 as much as you disconnect from the label become very familiar with the traits that make up a bpd diagnosis i made a list of the criteria and then i personalized it by writing down examples of how it played out in my own life i kept track over time of how i was doing in each area 3 drugs and alcohol are out they just are we dont have the luxury of indulging in this area if youre serious about transformation be drug and alcohol free edit on reflection this sounds heavyhanded on my part for me even small amounts of drug or alcohol seem to affect me more than many of my friends even weed can make me feel anxious in my real world i havent made this a hardfast rule part of our struggle is to get away from all or nothing thinking what i do know is that i have a tendency to not respond well to any kind of recreational drug or alcohol it can set off a downward spiral ive found that for me my life is much better without it and these days im not trying to escape my reality im very happy with my reality as it is 4 physical exercise becomes the new drug start with walking but commit to doing it everyday the step apps see great to keep track of your steps set a minimum number and commit to reaching it everyday 5 nutrition plays a role sugar in particular ive found being low carb keto specifically has helped tremendously im no longer brain foggy and exhausted all the time 6 relationships ok this is a biggie and the hardest one people are not all good or all bad relationships go through ups and downs stop taking what other people say do or think personally its not about you people have their own shit going on theyre not thinking about you refocus your attention on yourself discover that you have your own back for the first time in your life be there for yourself be your own savior stop the tapes in your head that tell you that you suck that youre too stupid too fat too ugly verbally out loud tell that voice to fuck off dont even attempt to be in a relationship if youre looking for the other person to save you in some way or dont ever make another person responsible for how you feel you are responsible for how you feel people can be assholes but so can you and i none of us a perfect and never will be 7 spirituality reconnect with your spiritual side whatever feels real to you develop a routine of prayer and meditation 8 take care of you make your bed pay your bills make a budget clean your car service your car go to the dentist have a physical exam in short do all the things all adults do to manage their life youre worth it these steps sound simple and most people who struggle with bpd symptoms me included gloss over this stuff taking care of the daily tasks is uber important for us it gives us a sense of structure and security we have to do this for ourselves 9 never take an immediate action on an emotional response youll regret it count to 100 when someone triggers you breathe it out physical exercise helps a lot with this stop the drama everything with love and compassion slow down your emotionality as much as you can remember no one knows whats going on inside your head unless you show it all of us will probably struggle with intense emotions our whole lives but we can manage it not overreacting is a skill we can learn i send all of you love none of us asked for this stuff none of us deserve it but know that you as a human being a worth giving yourself a chance to live your best life i believe in you i was a complete mess a decade ago hard work and time has made a huge difference in my life my life isnt perfect but i now know what its like to be happy i have solid relationships good job and im in the best shape of my life if i can do it trust me when i say anyone can,pre-pandemic

i have known my pcp for some time even before i had health anxiety i saw her many times in last year or so with usual ha symptoms dizziness fatigue palpitations in my last visit after she did that test where they ask you to squeeze their hand as hard as possible she did not let go of my hands and with my hands in hers she explained to me that nothing seems to be wrong with me physically and all my symptoms are most likely due to anxiety and stress it was so heartfelt and sincere that whole interactions calmed me down a lot the side effect is that now i got other type of heart ache i have got this full blown crush on a lady who is like 20 years older to me and i dont know what to do with it,pre-pandemic
sometimes i picture just hugging my crush or hanging out with my friends after high school even though i know that my crush will never like me and my friends will drift away from me i fucking hate life and im numb all the time a lot of the time im kind of passively killing myself ignoring chest pain not looking before crossing streets etc hopefully my day will come soon,pre-pandemic

fta california the first time lori tipton tried mdma she was skeptical it would make a difference i really was at the beginning very nervous tipton said mdma is the main ingredient in the club drug known as ecstasy or molly but tipton wasnt taking pills sold on the street to get high she was trying to treat her posttraumatic stress disorder by participating in a clinical trial after taking a dose of pure mdma tipton lay in a quiet room with two specially trained psychotherapists they sat next to her as she recalled some of her deepest traumas such as discovering her mothers body after tiptons mother killed two people and then herself in a murdersuicide,pre-pandemic

this doesnt seem to be common knowledge and i get that recreational drug use is illegal so your doctor is more likely to tell you never take ibuprofen than never take lsd when you receive your lithium prescription your doctor probably even tells you to never touch recreational drugs being a bipolar patient and all but were stubborn people who sometimes do impulsive shit while hypomanic never take lsd if you are on lithium you highly risk seizures andor psychotic breaks there are various accounts on erowid about this drug combination of the 9 reports where lithium was combined with lsd 6 users experienced seizures the remaining 3 users painted a very negative experience all including psychotic symptoms and extreme hallucinations with one user also experiencing repeated loss of consciousness i quote from the account of pufferfish who took one hit of lsd while taking just 90mg of lithium daily i started acting strange to the point where the sober ones there were worried and then started to convulse and stop breathing my face turned bright blue before my friend got me to start breathing again the paramedics came but couldnt keep me in one place so police cars showed up to help they strapped me down and put me in the ambulance x200b bonus harm reduction info using recreational drugs will have a negative effect on your stability but if you still plan to take drugs practice harm reduction methods i personally recommend 1 check psychonautwiki before taking any type of recreational drugs every single time even if you took it before double check your dosage the duration the interactions 2 always reagent test never blindly trust dealers how to test kit vendors available on rreagenttesting sometimes nbome is sold as lsd while fatal on high dosages unlike lsd 3 use milligram scales or volumetric dosing when choosing your dosage scoops and eyeballing lines are highly inaccurate methods 4 allergy test i once had an allergic reaction to a drug i had used before from the same bag as three friends of mine who were having a great time on it that scared the living shit out of me so now i make it a point to spread this information that youve used a substance before and that others are fine while using from the same batch doesnt mean you cannot be harmed x200b stay safe everyone 3,pre-pandemic

ive spent my whole life being depressed at 9 i was sexually abused and since then ive just been trying to distract myself from me ive never had a hobby because that required alone time with me i got my first job at 14 and worked constantly to avoid thinking about the abuse most of my life ive felt lost without a hobby everyone has something theyre passionate about cars cooking baking knitting what have you as much as i tried to get into all of those things none of them became a constant in my life but i am now spending my free time with puzzles i used to love jigsaw puzzles as a kid now i do jigsaw puzzles crosswords riddles im kind of excited about this ive been so sad lately and it feels like i am taking back my life there actually is something out there to enjoy,pre-pandemic

when i was 17 i went through an autistic obsession where i became obsessed with transgenderism and lgbt the obsession has passed even though i now know in hindsight that im not actually transgender and i was always a masculine boy who hated girl stuff it was almost like a psychotic delusion i suddenly became extremely obsessed with transgenderism and was convicted that im meant to be a girl to the point that i ordered estrogen from the darknet and got my name legally changed my parents were so alarmed by the sudden change in personality that they were worried i have a brain tumor now even though i detransitioned and quit hormones and dont wear girl clothes in public anymore my parents are still suffering from the consequences my parents lost many friends in this southern town who were offended by transgenderism people in this town saw me wearing girl clothes and long hair in public and they gave my parents dirty looks and stopped talking to them now my parents cant get those friends back because im apparently permanently tainted by the transgender devil,pre-pandemic
when i got off heroin about 6 years ago i went through a phase where i would do just about anything to get off i had convinced a doctor that i needed a script for xanax when i took it i never just took one pill it was always a few that some weed and i felt golden again aside from the fact that i was just substituting addictions the problem was that all the xanax would completely obliterate my inhibitions one day i did my usual thing a handful of pills and some weed and i decided to drive downtown to see if i could find something else i didnt care what i ended up meeting a guy named chuck chuck was a crackhead i had money and wanted to get higher so chuck took me to his spot boy did i get high crack was something else we sat in my jeep and started to talk before i knew it the conversation had gotten very deep i was an affluent kid i come from a great family who loves me i went to good schools etc chuck had a hell of a life no father homeless broken in so many ways as we sat there and i told him about my life chuck said something to me that i will never forget man what are you doin down here with me if you got it like that why you livin like this i was stunned for a brief moment he put everything into perspective i had no answer to his question i realized that chuck was a human in pain not just a crackhead how could a guy whom i had just met who was sitting in my car smoking crack with me have so much compassion for me his words have stuck with me ever since that day when im struggling wanting to get high after 6 years clean at this point i think about chuck if you got it like that why you livin like this i have a great life one that i wouldnt give up for anything hopefully his words will resonate with some of you like it did for me thanks chuck,pre-pandemic

i have so many questions i want to look up but even basic things lead straight back to veterans it makes me feel ashamed for having my trauma edit i have no issues with veterans and them getting resources to help my uncle works for a va hospital in georgia and there i saw first saw what ptsd was like i thought for a long time only vets got it then years later when i got diagnosed there were no resources for me to understand why it makes my trauma feel less traumatic to see that still today 10 years later only veterans and sometimes rpe survivors have readily available resources,pre-pandemic
i kind of realized this today abused at home and school as a kid abused at high school abused in college abused at my first second and pretty much every subsequent job including my current one abused in my current living situation and also a ton of random instances at events and other public spaces throughout my life i actually started getting down to thinking about each individual friend family member neighbor or close coworker ive ever had and theyve all done bad things to me ive forgiven almost all of them but it still happened even if im over it now i know this sounds like a massive victim complex but i promise its not my therapist says im one of the unluckiest people shes ever met sometimes life is just like that positive thinking helps me a lot i dont let this stuff get me down i got punched twice in the last 24 hours separate places and people and still think it was a pretty good day but damn ive never met a single nontoxic person in my entire life that sucks,pre-pandemic

i dont think i was ever in love but i just develop feelings too easily and too fast i never express it though since im afraid and i freak out too much i always confuse friendly behaviors as romantic gesture and attach myself to someone too fast but fall out easily too i recently developed feelings to my coworkersupervisor at work it seems like we have a lot in common and most importantly hes just a really nice and caring person he looks out for me and helps a lot i love going to work because hes there i feel like he has a girlfriend though and it would be inappropriate to pursue a senior coworker anyway but i dont know although i know its not gonna happen i cant stop caring about him hes probably just really nice to me cuz hes my coworker i tend to attach myself to people at work or communities since i dont have anyone in my personal life im just alone when im home so i just stay outside or stay late at work i want to know the feeling of being excited to go home,pre-pandemic
its rant time half of the posts on here are people simply complaining about the negative effects of adhd even if you guys ask for help the top comment is usually something along the lines of im the same way life sucks adhd sucks etc etc even if i try injecting a little positivity it usually gets shot down or ignored ive been told on here that theres absolutely zero benefits to having adhd why are you people so negative you have an abnormality in your brain that will literally never go away it is who you are instead of fighting it and telling yourself what a bad person you are why dont you just accept it and use it to your advantage you cant keep an entry level job maybe thats not what youre cut out for maybe you should look at the things you are good at the things you can hyperfocus on and make a living out of that meds are a godsend and theyll help fill in the gaps where necessary doing well in life is mostly about mindset like i said whether you like it or not your brain is always going to be adhd you can say to yourself that youre bound to this terrible debilitating disorder and live the rest of your life in misery because you think youre not good enough or you can thank god that you arent like everyone else and you actually have a lot of unique traits i cant understand why anyone wants to settle for just a normal life with adhd you can thrive off of a constantly changing environment hyperfocusing on whatever your brain chooses along the way you naturally think outside the box society needs people like us in order to progress can you imagine if there were never different people throughout history i highly doubt we would have any of the innovations we do today personally im okay with having adhd i dont see it as a disorder before you run to the comments to criticize yes i am aware of the structural differences in the brain ive seen the barkley videos etc i still dont see the point in living miserably because i have this terrible disorder i enjoy having varied interests knowing in depth information about random topics ranging from history to cars to movies etc and for the things that i struggle with school mostly there are meds even when im not in school i still use meds to be more productive but my brain is still adhd tldr it doesnt make sense to live your life in misery because you have adhd make the best of it edit ive been thinking about it and ive decided this sub is toxic and i think im gonna leave deuces,pre-pandemic

its amazing how apple can buy beats by dre with its eyes closed but completely ignore the pleas of the autism parents the company relies on for its promotion of ipad as an assistive device yes you read that correctly apple completely ignores the parents of autistic children and in essence autistic children as well how so thats a pretty simple answer lets take a gander at apple support communities this is an online community that supposedly exists in order for apple users to not only correspond with other customers in order to gain valuable knowledge and resolve issues but also as a forum to air out concerns to apple in hopes of future enhancement thread 8031828 is a concerning one the main post created by mkmartel is titled how to limit volume in ipad ios 102 the user posted on august 4 2017 see user mkmartel is a lot like me a working parent with an autistic child my son was diagnosed at the age of two and is now a thriving tenyear old his best friend is an ipad parents of autistic parents all invest hardearned dollars into ipads because of the marketing behind the devices being assistive to those with special needs one problem volume limit perhaps apple needs to hire a special needs adviser to the staff maybe parttime maybe just a temp see autistic children have the tendency to crank the volume up to the highest level no matter what its part of the inherent sensory issues those under the autism spectrum have this may not seem like a big deal to those parents with typical children but this can be quite disturbing and nerveracking on a continuous basis below is the entirety from the main poster mkmarkel my son has autism and loves to watch videos on ipad however he loves turning the volume all the way up no matter how much i turn it down or ask him to turn it down there is no reasoning with him on this the second i turn my head he turns it all the way up and it drives me crazy ive gone to the restrictions part of settings and enabled the do not allow changes part of the volume limit but that didnt do anything the volume can still be changed very easily you cant tell me after all these years apple doesnt have a way to set a max volume on a device amen mkmarkel amen the ipad has a volume limit that only limits music when headphones are on but when headphones are not in the equation all bets are off can you imagine how unnerving an ipad can be at full blast during a movie when just waking in the morning or a public library are you telling me the super geek brainiacs at apple cannot write the code for a setting that limits the volume on ipads i think apple has made way bigger strides dont you check out the rest of the pleas from parents of autistic children on the same page completely ignored by apple its been 18 months and counting since the initial post 10117this could have been written by me and is the bane of my life apple please sort this out if anyone ever finds out if the volume can be limited please post here as i cant get it to work on my sons ipad mumania 11418as a mom to twin boys with developmental delay and adhd the volume level and ensuing meltdowns are maddening after research the volume limit controls and restrictions only apply to the headphones when in use major bummer mazda3s 32418i could have written that word for word my autistic son keeps turning the volume all the way up as well apple please fix this appleieverything 32918i will never understand how they can market this as an assistive device and not fix this issue weve all been complaining about since the first generation the volume fights are ridiculous how is this still an issue we never use music and videos or tv as its called in the current iteration doesnt apply the music volume limit so frustratingeisnikki from the parent of an autistic child thank you apple for caring about us whats your workaround buy beats headphones,pre-pandemic

ok so what somtimes really pisses me off is the masses of people claiming to be autistic without a diagnosis generally its teenagersyoung adults who often claim to have other mental disorders i know its difficult to get a diagnosis and its a long process but at least where i live its free under the nhs autism isnt something you can just claim to have its complex and needs the opinions of specialists who have undergone training a lot of people claiming to be autistic tend to disregard this obviously i think its fine to suspect that you have autism but it just really upsets me when people just say they have it its really devalidating firstly ive struggled for years due to my autism and still people say to me well its not real is it people claiming to be autistic is a major contributer to this idk if i sound bitter or ignorant but this is something that really upsets me thanks lol,pre-pandemic

a little while ago i wrote this up to try and explain how i feel taking seroquel all these drugs rattle around in our brains differently but maybe someone can relate to how this one lives in me backstory i take it every night at 830 and this day i had to take it late and wake up early seroquel is an angry beast with sharp claws the 830 pm pill routine is to keep a nice schedule for bipolar happiness and make it possible to wake up but seroquel doesnt just make me tired at night and make it hard to wake up in the morning it is wreaking havoc in me that i need to be asleep to get through i dont get tired at night like you get tired i cant just stay awake instead of feeling tired i feel my body shut down even if i say conscious i feel like every system is stopping anyway whatever processes are necessary to keep me alive are all rebooting thats why youve probably heard me talk angry or in short sentences at night internally im fighting to communicate with whatever resources are left the push down to sleep is important seroquel does a strong push down followed by a big kick up if im still awake for the up kick things get bad i have the seizure like movements i have to move some part of my body my legs my arms my head into a pillow not moving is painful i have to move and i get anxious and confused the nights ive run into this without then taking sleep meds are some of the worst nights ive had it feels like ive been awake for days but something is stopping me from sleeping theres a door that wont open my brain would stop buzzing and my body would stop hurting if i could go through the door but i just cant i guess seroquel really is all about resources if i skip a day the night is ok but the next day is bad its like blood stops circulating through my brain i have all day to use the same allotment of blood that is usually refreshed every few heart beats so the longer the day goes the ratio of oxygen to waste in the blood is declining and thinking gets harder and harder and slower missing seroquel feels like all the bones were taken out of your body not that you cant physically operate but that there is a hole inside of you that goes through every part of you waking up early today isnt about waking up drinking coffee and doing some jumping jacks wont change anything seroquel doesnt let you wake up until your body has had enough time to get it out of your blood if it is still in there then you are not capable of functioning it doesnt matter how much i want to i cant today it felt like there was a wall in my brain i couldnt move through in the shower it felt like somehow i could feel every cell in my brain and they were all trying to turn in circles like each part of my brain was having a seizure it hurt i know you cant feel your brain there are no nerves in there but seroquel makes you think you feel all kinds of sensations up there most of them bad psych meds are strange theyre nothing like alcohol or benadryl or cold meds or opiates or pot or anything im missing those all feel like youre on something you are still you you are just on something something fun or sleepy or strange not psych meds they change you they are inside you they regulate how you feel what you think you are who you are you nothing like anything else seroquel is the worst psych med i have ever taken with the right precautions it is the most helpful med ever but the side effects are horrible and the amount of effort and planning and vigilance needed to work around the angry claws is crazy i hate the 830 alarm but the 830 alarm keeps me going,pre-pandemic

you know how babies dont have object permanence like when you cover your face you disappear to them put a blanket over a toy and it may as well not exist anymore thats how it is with bpd but with the people i love when theyre in front of me telling me how they feel its perfect my heart is full and i believe them but as soon as theyre gone well they may as well not exist they must not care for me anymore i must not matter to them their feelings must have changed and sometimes even my feelings change i cant imagine all that loving energy all i feel is fear that my loved one is gone man the trauma is real the fear of abandonment is real i just want to believe that something can be real without it being right in front of me and repeated to me over and over and over until the other person is so tired of repeating themselves that they do disappear for good,pre-pandemic

my ptsd is a result of sexual abuse it took me a very long time to even be open to the idea of sex once i began having sex with a guy i was dating it messed me up a lot we ended up ending an otherwise great relationship because of all the sexual incompatibility and ive felt very hopeless about dating since then but last night i had sex with a guy who was incredibly gentle and asked permission to do everything that we did i didnt cry or get in my head or lose my shit and we actually had a second go round basically my first overwhelmingly positive sexual experience and im so happy that ive cried theres hope,pre-pandemic

i havent eaten in two days he knew he mentioned a grilled cheese and tomato soup one of my all time favorites i reluctantly agreed my stomach growled loudly when he mentioned it so he made me a grilled cheese and some soup he heated up my safe tomato soup used 0 cal cooking spray instead of butter like he usually does and just made a baby sandwich one slice of bread cut in half it was more than i had planned on eating but he did everything he could to make it safer for me without me even asking he isnt perfect but damn this feels like a victory for both of us in a weird way,pre-pandemic

every time there is a shooting on the news every fucking time its all over my facebook all over reddit news articles basically everywhere this is a mental health crisis ive seen people openly advocate national registries which would severely limit our rights ive seen people advocate for involuntary confinement regardless of whether an individual is showing symptoms of their illness ive seen comments as severe as round them up and put them down it doesnt take a lot of digging to find research that shows mental illness isnt the problem multiple articles ive found say that less than 5 of violent crime is perpetrated by individuals with a diagnosable mental illness its mental illness is simply an easy answer were a scapegoat the vast majority of us are not dangerous at all and it makes me very upset to see us painted as murderous lunatics,pre-pandemic
i just wanted to share that i havent missed a single class for the first month of this semester in college im currently a junior and by this point in the semester ive always missed at least one class usually a lot more my issues with attendance drastically affect my grades ive almost failed multiple courses because of missed assignments but fortunately once i explained my situation my professors were generally understanding and gave me extra time at a certain point though they had to draw a line just because of school policy generally i do pretty well in school when im stable and i still manage to decently during episodes usually managing to maintain straight bs but i have gotten a few cs prior to my diagnosis i had never had a c and usually had straight as maybe a few bs so it was tough to underperform to what i usually did but now im proud to even be making it through school given everything im going to have a degree from a good school and theres no way in hell my bipolar is taking it away im writing this now because today it was hard to get out of bed and it was a day where i would usually skip class but i fought through it and im just proud,pre-pandemic
my place is so messy its always been messy i try to clean but it barely seems to put a dent in it i just want to throw everything in the garbage including the furniture and still feel like it would be a mess and then sterilize it with some kind of industrial spray,pre-pandemic
i say gradual its not ive posted on every damned group available not so much fuelling my reassurance bank but just out of general concern ive had weird chest pains which jolt my left side centre of left man boob and then my ribs and sternum this this caused my anxiety to skyrocket on the 12 of august im a writer for a living so im constantly hunched over and im a new dad which brings with it the odd muscle strain at least thats what im telling myself im perfectly healthy heartwise bodywise weighed in at 120 kgs now in a month im at 110 obviously with that comes ah the cancer i have been googling about however because im apparently dying every second every little ache and pain especially the pulled muscle chest pain causes me to stand up with a fright rub my itchy head and pace around wondering what im going to wear to the hospital so i dont completely look like an overweight homeless dude who is either having a heart attack stroke or other strange extraterrestrial disease i have concocted in my head as a 24year old im fine im not dying i took citalopram for about a week and told myself this is not who you are but as any young adult or any adult who works long hours in an office we all feel muscle tension and stiffness in our arms chest back legs all because were zombies who just live paycheck to paycheck when i get wrist pain and elbow pain and shoulder pain and yes even neck pain i fret over the next heart attack and stroke even an aneurysm then after the heart has stopped beating so fast because i realise im young anxious and have a son who i adore and want to see grow up i calm down and call myself names were sensitive were like ice cubes in the sun one little thing one little tingle in the toe can set us off we melt away and we become others outside and next to ourselves i hate it i understand there are some people on this sub who have concerns that may actually be warrantedbut 96 of the time were allowing the little goblin in our minds to play havoc if youre reading this release your shoulders move your neck around sit up straight what ive come learn is that im always tense even if i dont mean to be i catch it i catch myself slouching sitting on my phone too long arms bent neck drooped halfway down to the earths core yes we cant control it i have at least five to six impending heart attacks and strokes a day but we can try gradually to deal with it medication cbt yoga those two small chocolates from last year that you are adamant are the reason why your anxiety is so bad were all in the same boat i have strange phobias loud noises bugs which im afraid will climb in my ears choking i had issues with showering being on the toilet for too long standing too long not waking up after a nap even tying my shoelaces might have a heart attack from bending over the reason i am writing this is because i was home alone for a while my wife went out to the shop obviously with nothing really to do i started thinking just casual let me google why my headache is a tingly feeling not a great idea why because i convinced myself that i was having a stroke my stomach at this very moment is mildly sore which means im hungry but because of the heightened sense of pain of unreality i convinced myself as well that i had ruptured my spleen or have appendicitis im just hungry and finished off my second cup of coffee again coffee is giving me high cholesterol which will give me a heart attack which its notunless obviously i have at least eight cups a day and eat horribly best advice i ever received was from my mom stop overthinking it if youre having a heart attack go for a walk sounds bad but its the reality of the situation if you can exercise like a walk youre not having a heart attack if you are having a stroke you certainly wont be able to get up and choose an outfit for your hospital trip pack a bag and then having a quick and quiet smoke i apologize but im tired laughably im more of a baby than my baby at least when he gets a slight knock he soldiers on unlike me who has some serious disease because im bleeding so profusely from a paper cut yes this is a serious mental condition which affects millions and millions of people it can be manageable this doesnt mean our lives are over you are not the only one look at this sub and how many people are on here my first day on here i discovered my lung cancer was the same as someone elses costochondritis we seek support we seek isolation we seek support again i dont know what the hell kind of post this is but im generally a hypochondriac simplest way to describe someone on here suggested updating our posts every two days so as to prove to ourselves that we are not dying today that is pure gold i have been doing it and it helps find that post and read it regards just one of the millions,pre-pandemic

addiction trigger warning i had been sober from methamphetamine since august of 2014 i have an excellent career and i am getting married to an incredible woman in august up until a couple months ago my past use was just a passing memory that had little emotional bearing and zero draw starting in october whenever i would have a free moment of thought driving from work or going to sleep my mind would shift to visceral imagery of a needle going into my vein the blood being drawn sometimes if i was alone i would yell for my mind to stop my heart rate would quicken and my chest would tighten the march of latent drug addiction was impossible to stop i shared my urges with my fiance my best friend and even the addiction subreddit i was doing everything i could think of to stop this scenario from playing out i did not want this to happen with the dark web getting drugs is exceptionally easy so in a moment of weakness i ordered a ball of meth about a minute after i pushed the plunger down i texted my fiance to tell her what i did she is so sympathetic supportive but also incredibly scared for me im so thankful i can be completely honest with her right now im in the crashing stage my arms are sore from pumping poison into them and im developing a plan so this never happens again i threw away the rest of the drugs which was most of it im setting up an appointment with a therapist going to my first ever na meeting and hopefully getting my shit back together i cant let this precipitate a return to drug use i am very disappointed and i know that i instead of a pressure release i may have just fed my demons thanks for listening,pre-pandemic
i got my first acceptance letter today high school was a pretty shit experience for me anxiety held me back and lead to me missing things like football games and prom it got so bad that i had to get home tutors for two years because i couldnt even manage to leave my house for awhile i considered dropping out because i literally believed it was impossible to continue but i couldnt be more proud right now im in school for senior year i will be attending my graduation ceremony and i am going to college hell yeah so if anyone feels like giving up trust me if i can get into college with my attendance record looking the way it is you can do pretty much anything edit thank you to everyone who took time to share your experiences and congratulations it means so much and its encouraging to no end you all are such lovely people,pre-pandemic

ive been catching myself doing this a lot lately and its somewhat hard to explain but i feel this group will understand basically for most of what i do i explain it in my head as if someone is gonna question me example if im at the gym and im doing a certain exercise ill already run a scenario in my head where someone is asking me why im doing what im doing another example i keep a notebook with me to write down things i need to remember and whatnot clutch i regularly run a scenario where someone asks me why im writing in a notebook it comes down to conversations in my head that will never happen and forcing myself to defend myself in fantasy situations its exhausting shut up brain,pre-pandemic
there will be times where my boyfriend will ask to have sex and even if im not in the mood or i dont want to at that moment ill still say yes anyways part of it is because i know the dopamine rush will most likely help me but also because i feel like if i dont then it will make my boyfriend no longer like me or cause him to want to cheat hes never done anything to make me think this but i feel like my bpd causes me to overreact,pre-pandemic
this sounds stupid i know but ill try to explain i had to deal with a lot of gaslighting growing up it made me question myself my whole life and made me feel like i didnt exist trying to get help is a nightmare when your abuser is able to hide and deny that anything ever happened i was denied healthcare and food throughout my childhood i cant believe im watching the country being run by abusive people that commit crimes and lie about it and the other party seems almost complacent by not arresting or fining those who are in contempt i feel like im living with my childhood abuser and my guardian is turning a blind eye does anyone else feel this way somebody please tell me im not the only one i feel like im losing my mind obsessively reading the news every day on the chance that i might see some justice it makes me ill and i cant stop obsessing over it i feel so stupid but thats what this illness is doing to me how do i stop its almost all i think about anymore i cant handle that my abuser got away with everything and im watching it happen all over again its a nightmare edit thank you all for your kind words and support talking about this made me feel so much better because of yall im going to try and block news sources and as one of you suggested watching steven colbert more lol i also love john oliver i cant thank you enough for making me feel less crazy i feel like when i bring it up in real life nobody really cares and theyre just like yeah it sucks oh well but to many of us its seriously traumatizing and im forever grateful for your support,pre-pandemic
im not going to brag about my own stability lets just say im successful bigger than getting the right medical cocktail bigger than going to the right therapist and bigger than my other privileges in life the largest beneficial thing ive done for myself is quitting drinking and using cocaine i went from weekly mood episodes and a steady hypomanic manic energy to experiencing episodes about once a year no coincidence they happen when i slip up in my sobriety if youre having trouble that you cant seem to escape no matter how hard youre working in other areas of your life please consider sobriety maybe its the missing piece of your recovery are you an addict reach out to sober groups aa na refuge recovery smart recovery all available for free near you and online refuge recovery in particular has been the best for me as it closely mirrors my buddhist faith if youre scared of going sober than it is probably best that you do and youll reap the benefits have questions about sobriety getting sober feel free to ask me anything,pre-pandemic

been seeing a lot of peopke freaking out about the coronavirus spreading i blame the news outlets for amplifying it so heres a few things to remember 1 you are more likely to get the flu or a common cold than the coronavirus 2 your chances of getting the coronavirus are extremely low especially if you havent been to china within the past month 3 most of the people who have died have had other underlying health issues or were older 4 all of the cases in the us were people who traveled to wuhan there have been no reports of human to human transmission in the us 5 say you do get the coronavirus most people get mild coldflu symptoms 6 wash your hands use hand sanitizer stay hydrated eat right dont fucking go to schoolwork if youre sick it will help stop the spread of germs 7 get your fucking flu shot none of you are going to die from the coronavirus the flu kills more people each year mainly the elderlychildren people with compromised immune systems the media likes to hype things up to the max ia thr coronavirus a problem sure so is the flu and so so many people get that each year and survive relax,pre-pandemic

ten years ago i traveled abroad with a group for a gap year in south america we had a weird and terrible experience when we went to a spa retreat owned by an expat american man 7 of the other girls were molested during a spiritual healing ceremony without anyone saying a word they all were 18 and thats the only reason i can think they didnt speak up i went last and fought the abuser and got out of there then went to my group leader with it and as i told her about it the rest of the group chimed in saying me too me too against our wishes the group leader told the abuser the reason why we decided to leave early and the abuser came to my room at night to try to tell me it was all innocent i was still just a kid but i had to be the face of the group then our own groups leader talked to me about it later in the trip and said it was all a misunderstanding that things were different back in the hippy days and she was raised with that kind of thing and he didnt mean anything by it i went home from the trip afraid of being touched at all by my significant other and it took months for me to recover enough to just be touched flash forward to today i watched a documentary about a man who abused foster kids and at the end the story said the abuser had moved to a tiny island outside guam where there was little oversight i remembered my experience and i realized its possible hes still out there doing exactly the same thing sure enough his tripadvisor is full of recent reviews hes definitely still in business and as i searched i found out a woman went to his establishment and was raped by him two months after our groups visit she traveled back to his country with her husband to sue him and talk to the media reading this really validated my experience because i had been wavering in my mind about the experience all these years but this was a totally separate incident right at the same time we were there so i wrote about the experience in detail in their tripadvisor comments i explained exactly what happened in that public forum i felt i needed to take some sort of action and i think this was an impactful thing to do im worried tripadvisor might take the comment down i got a message back from his wife on my review and it essentially said i must be mistaken it brings me joy to think he and his wife had to revisit this subject yet again and that i might save someone else from going through what i did it feels good to have done it but it hurts me that i cant share it with anyone i feel empowered but also alone edit thank you for the support i have actually been feeling guilty for possibly hurting this guys familys livelihood and started questioning myself so your support is really appreciated im thousands of miles away and relatively anonymous but i still dont feel safe,pre-pandemic

hey guys i know a lot of the folks in this sub are struggling with addiction every day and it sucks four months ago alcohol pretty much controlled my life i know that everyone is different and i cant speak to what you need on your journey with alcohol but i am hoping that me sharing this will speak to someone that was in a similar place that i was 4 months ago and maybe it can help i was drinking 23 bottles of wine a night or the equivalent in wine and vodka and woke up everyday feeling like complete shit id been abusing alcohol for awhile hiding my drinking sneaking tiny bottles of wine everywhere i was overweight my blood pressure was ridiculous and i have 4 kids and a beautiful wife i was listening to a podcast and heard about this book called this naked mind by annie grace i read the entire thing and i can honestly say that it completely changed my life and my view of alcohol in the first chapters the book had me write down exactly why i drink it was pretty crazy to look my reasons face to face and as uncomfortable as this is i wanted to share with you guys what i wrote i like the taste of beer it helps me deal with the craziness of 4 kids at 5pm it helps me forget the things im not looking forward to on the next day it helps me not worry so much about my health weight it helps me not worry so much in general it helps me be more outgoing not worry so much about what people think about me when socializing i like the camaraderie of drinking with other people i feel like it makes me a more fun dad i feel cool because i can drink hard liquor straight up i am proud of my ability to hold my booze and drink fast it helps me be present i like the ritual of going to the store everyday to get a drink maybe you can relate but these were the lies i was telling myself to justify my habit that was killing me i feel like i was promised by alcohol that it would deliver all these things and it probably did occasionally but the majority of the time it delivered nothing but hurt and pain alcohol lied to me and made me its bitch next i wrote out why i wanted to quit and when i first quit i just committed to 30 days i knew i could do anything for 30 days and told myself that id decide what to do after those 30 days based on how i felt here are the reasons i wrote out for quitting for 30 days im tired of waking up fuzzy headed and shakey im tired of trying to remember what happened the night before i want to lose weight i want to actually be healthy and not constantly worried that im going to die i dont feel normal i dont feel like myself i dont want to just endure my kids i want to enjoy them i want to be in control again im tired of thinking about alcohol so much and worrying how and when i can drink again i want to enjoy little things in life again like drawing or painting or crafts or woodworking i dont want to die young i want to see my kids grow up i want to succeed at know and love and have energy mindset to actually pursue it i want to be more proactive and excited at my job and invest in my team i didnt like what happened on st patricks day i drank way too much it was bad i can see my family members struggling with alcohol i dont want that i want to sleep better im so tired of worrying about what is or isnt working right in my body due to alcohol i want to not spend so much damn money on alcohol so we can pay off debt faster and buy a house this list along with the very compelling arguments against alcohol in the this naked mind book literally changed my brain im not sure how to explain it any other way but i have freedom last month i went on a work trip to an all inclusive resort for a week and didnt touch a drop of alcohol the best part is that i was happy the whole time i wasnt suffering and feeling like i was being punished because i now have and feel all of those things i wrote out above my health has improved drastically i sleep amazing ive lost 60 pounds i appreciate my family so much more i have new purpose and im moving forward in life and no drink or feeling that a drink gives me is worth trading all of that in thanks for reading my journey again i know everyone is different and there are so many factors with alcohol addiction i dont think this method of spontaneous sobriety can and should work for everyone but if you are questioning your relationship with alcohol and feel trapped i would suggest doing something dont waste anymore of this one beautiful and precious life you have being a slave to the lie that alcohol is needed there is so much freedom and joy on the other side feel free to message me if i can help you at all jason,pre-pandemic
basically none of my friends are comfortable with me venting to them and it just hurts i hate how i get like this and i hate that it feels like nobody cares i want people to care i want to feel like i matter but i dont despite how hard i try to be positive instead i pour my heart out to anyone and everyone because im weak and that scares people away i hate that im crying right now because my gf is being moody and needs some space i hate that i have no control over anything i feel useless and unwanted a mistake that should have never happened even my parents regret me and dont know what to do to help me i just want to close my eyes tonight and drift away im so damn tired of this i hate the flip flop of emotions how my fp can make me dance like a puppet how one minute im with them and im content with life and actually am looking forward to the future to me curling in bed dry crying and wanting to be dead because she wants a single night alone and i hate that im self aware of all this i just want to accept whats going on i want to accept that im not in control that things happen but i cant instead i throw a fit and cry,pre-pandemic

tldr at the bottom about 1011 months ago i went cold turkey off of xanax i am currently 20 years old 62 180 lbs and still living at home i was taking roughly 712 bars a day and i lost the memory of a huge chunk of my life during the infancy of my sobriety i was going insane and my body felt like it was killing itself i lost a ridiculous amount of weight and i looked like i just walked out of a concentration camp i was so skinny and bony i destroyed a lot of relationships and friendships through my addiction and usage i even got into a car accident that could have killed 3 small children in the back and i was kicked out of my home for a few nights though cold turkey wasnt the best way of going about things my father denied me access to a doctor to get medical help for sobering up as time progressed i was still working 40 hours a week and still occasionally smoking weed fast forward today im at a healthy weight and clear mind today was like any other day off work mowing the grass making plans with friends but i was in need of an electric razor and i knew my dad had one in his bathroom so i go and search the drawers and when i look in the last drawer i see it not the razor but a prescription bottle of pearly white xanax bars my father must have stashed them there when i got caught before i got sober my heart stopped my mouth got watery and i began to sweat im almost a year sober and havent seen a xanax bar since and now im faced with 50 of them just sitting there in my reach i had no idea what to do but my addiction demanded i take half a bar just to get that high back and remember what it was like to feel blissful and at rest but i came too far i sat there and stared at the bottle and even held some of the bars in my hand but i knew this abusive relationship had to be over with once and for all so i took the bottle walked to my bathroom and popped the cap then i held it over the toilet and slowly tipped it and watched each bar drop into the water then i flushed it and they were gone and today i have made the hardest choice an addict will come face to face with and i succeeded in establishing the fact that i want to be sober and i want to be better this story isnt just for me to boast its a story that shows any one of you have the will power to break the chain around your throats and be free of addiction whatever it may be i believed in myself and i believe in all of you tldr found a bottle of xanax after ive been sober from them for almost a year and flushed them down a toilet and cried,pre-pandemic
how could having a relationship be a good idea when most of us on this thread are probably really unstable some getting their thoughts out some contemplating ending it some already having decided and making their last remarks i dont think life has a meaning but i do think love is the closest thing that means the slightest to me the only times in the last 3 years i see shimmer of light is when a potential romantic interest arises the feelings are different to those of friends of family for me selfish to want it or engage when you sleep for 16 hours some days dont respond to meds and are very unstable one day having made plans to end your life the nest cancelling them being paralysed in bed another day all those sorts of things make relationships unattainable and daunting for people like us so unfair and angering everyone deserves love especially those who are suffering and suicidal i feel we deserve it the most but we cant feel it like other people because our mind is torturing us and convincing us we dont deserve it ive turned down girls for poor and unresponsive multiple mental illnesses will continue to do so until my health is stable which is as likely as me winning the lottery heartbreaking,pre-pandemic

if you have goodnatured adhd kids you may find that unmedicated homeschooling is a better fit than a traditional classroom 1 my kids can talk to themselves and move around while they work it doesnt bother anyone so its not a problem 2 my kids can spend hours outside running and playing and daydreaming 3 my kids produce stacks of doodles every day 4 my kids are ahead of school kids because they can finish k3 level work in less than an hour a day we do year round schooling for a predictable routine 5 if my kids ask an off topic question about something cool we go and find the answer none of this now is not the time ask me tomorrow when tomorrow never comes crud bascially if your adhd kids dont have other issues homeschooling removes the parts of the classroom that make adhd unbearable and lets your children mature at their own rate we still practice sitting still and not interrupting but we dont tie it to academics so learning doesnt suffer because of adhd,pre-pandemic
i was a huge fan of the show house particularly in college and high school as someone who wasnt diagnosed until young adulthood 26 i sometimes look back on my past through the lens of adhd to try and make sense of past behaviors preferences etc i had this random thought as you do that one of the reasons i felt like i related to dr house very strongly in the past was his lackadaisical behavior when it came to routine but intense interest in bizarre and novel cases and personal drama friends coworkers his intense interest in general hospital thats when it hit me did house have adhd and by extension does sherlock holmes house is based on holmes have adhd i did a little google search and someone in this subreddit beat me to the punch sounds convincing to me makes me feel better about my adhd too ill swallow that koolaid with a smile on my face,pre-pandemic

really i promise when it comes to chronic illness a lot of the time people always try to only focus on positivity i dont let bipolar beat me i wont let bipolar keep me from doing what i love ill fight hard every day theres definitely a core of truth to maintaining a positive attitude throughout this disease but i also find that too often it comes at the expense of not allowing yourself to feel the bad parts because sometimes acknowledging that youre not okay when it comes to bipolar feels like a huge personal failure like you werent trying hard enough like you should have known and done better because how can you keep up with being positive if you let the negative interfere i want you all to know that its so very much okay to not be okay youre allowed to feel frustrated stressed and tired youre allowed to be fed up with this shit youre allowed to curse at bipolar and the ignorance spread about our condition were finite and were human this shit wears us down bipolar disorder is really hard and thats okay it would be weird if this stuff didnt negatively impact us dont get caught in the positivity trap where you only allow yourself to feel positive things because you have to or else you dont have to be positive all the time its super important for us to feel these frustrations and all the other bullshit so we can process them rather than push them aside and bottle them up until they cave in on us doing so is known to help prevent burnout and makes for happier healthier people give yourself the space and time to feel the bad stuff be sad cry punch things at the gym go for a long and lonely walk yell play violent games listen to heavy metal bitch at friends do all these things so you dont get stuck pent up in the background and unable to move forward youll feel so much better if you give yourself permission to feel these things take a nap or go to bed for the night afterwards and when you wake up reflect and plan why were you feeling this way can you trace it back to one specific event or does it feel like an accumulation of many things are you setting reasonable expectations for yourself or are you holding yourself to a really high standard that is setting you up for failure be honest with yourself and your expectations once you have answered these kind of questions you have processed the emotions attached to the situation at least partially a better understanding of whats going on to make you feel this way or clues to follow up on in the next step to figure that out the ability to start planning on ways to make things easier for you remember to take it one step at a time focus on what you can do be kind to yourself you deserve it its okay to not have the answer to fix your most pressing issues whats important is to make a list and go down it and deal with each item one piece at a time can you delegate x obligation thats stressing you out do it can you skip or reassign chores to make things fairer and less burdensome do it can you set reminders on your phone to remember your injections or mealtimes do it one thing at a time as important as it is to acknowledge the bad please also celebrate your accomplishments even if its just a small thing that everyone else does all the time if you struggled with it but you did it anyway you should be proud of that achievement dont measure yourself by what others do bipolar and chronic illness is about you nobody else you are your own standard you do what you can without hurting yourself and that is at all times excellent its important to understand that trying our best is all we can ask from ourselves and that trying your best doesnt mean you have to break yourself in the process youre valuable youre capable youve got this even when things are bad youre no less worthy of love support and care its okay to not be okay,pre-pandemic
its me im bitches,pre-pandemic

i just wanted to share this sub has been real helpful and relatable and i just wanted to let you guys know that there is a lot you can achieve with adhd sometimes in spite of it and other times because of it clearly it all affects us differently and i think plenty of people in this sub have worse symptoms than me but i think there is a lot of upside to being a creative emotional and forgetful ball of energy i feel so happy life doesnt feel real i got a parking ticket today because all i can think about is where im going to law school thank you guys for being here and dont count yourselves out due to your diagnosis,pre-pandemic

edit theres an ama im doing on iama board but i dont have a link to post so if you have any questions ask them there this is my first time posting here so im a little unsure of how these normally go but am going to be vague on country names for obvious reasons i was 19 and was stood opposite a man in a shithole of a country in africa shooting a documentary for aidshiv orphans the landscape of the country painted to me by the charity itself back in the uk was one of peacefulness and rebuilding the reality was slightly different in front of me about 30 meters behind this man lets call him bob were two trucks of heavily armed men who were trying to kidnap me i stood opposite bob looked him directly in the eyes and told him i was going to murder every single person who wanted to take me and i meant it i had prepared myself over the past three days of sleepless nights as they shouted my name and reved the engines almost as if to taunt me holding a very large machete and coming to terms with what i was about to do i very quickly realized how far i was prepared to go to protect myself and my life if it meant doing massive amounts of damage to ensure that i was firmly in the fight camp of thefight or flight way of thinking when i first arrived i was nearly run over and had a pistol put in my face by this local gang who run drugs and weapons inside the country itself that very day i bought my machete and used it to protect myself it is the sole reason im here and able to share this story with you statistically speaking most arent alive anymore when going through these kind of ordeals as they are normally kidnapped tortured or sold into slavery the phrase you have no idea how im feeling isnt said to flaunt a higher level of depravity ive experienced its just not many people can relate spending a month with no sleep clutching a razor sharp machete waiting for a gang of armed men to come and grab you at night and preparing yourself to kill is a situation i wouldnt put my worst enemy in it is a living hell segment 2 had a beer and am more able to get this out i realise there isnt much context to the picture im trying to paint so ill wind it back a bit so you know more about what it is im trying to share i like you am smart most people i have met with depression are intelligent this ranges from genius ive met a few to the average thinking man or woman although being successful in my rugby career international trials academys for pro teams i am not a violent person quite the opposite im very quite and well mannered i dont come from money and most of my wages go to helping put my brother through university or helping to pay for my parents mortgage charity really is important to me the reason i got involved with the charity film was i wanted to help a large charity in raising awareness working as a kp dishwasher for a few years and saving money i funded the entire trip and managed to get my local college high school in american terms to lend me a camera and tripod as i was top of my class and the teachers were really behind me in developing so im finding it hard to go into details about the month spent there i honestly want to be able to pour it all out onto this keyboard because at the end of the day i guess im using this as some form of therapy the best way to put it would be that i learned alot i filmed corruption the money raised in uk and europe was being diverted into drugs and being skimmed this meant the orphans who i spent alot of time with were sleeping on cold concrete in the middle of winter with no clothes huddled together for warmth on the odd occasion whilst i was out looking for firewood i would spot toddlers and children walking around with a blunt hacksaw trying to find something to burn to keep themselves warm needless to say i gave them everything i had even the bag i carried with me it was hugely frustrating and depressing having a tiny child come over and just hold part of you be it a part of my coat or a shoelace i felt like i somehow embodied protection over the children who otherwise had nobody to be there for them on returning to the uk i started university within two weeks of starting i received a phone call informing me that most of the children that were in the footage i was editing at the time had died the winter was far too harsh and the money had been misspent and stolen away from them i cried went to my local shop still crying and bought a bottle of whiskey the young cashier girl asked me what was up and i paraphrased the situation the best i could behind me in the line somebody said im glad thats a couple less niggers in the world i snapped and attacked him i smashed the bottle over his head and beat him to the ground it wasnt a fair fight when i finished beating him covered in blood i spat on him and walked away im not proud of this but it became the defining moment in what i now realise was a changing of person all of a sudden i was isolated much like in africa alone and prepared to defend myself and those who were weak from those who were abusive wrong or too strong for any voice to be heard i need to take another break i will continue this i just need to grab some fresh air and probably another beer segment 3 im skipping over areas here but i think id rather focus on the important milestones over all the particular detailsnow im 20 and am having a conversation with a genius about identity we were sat in a sushi bar in la i had befriended his stepson whilst working in the uk and managed to save enough money to get out there across the pond he worked in a university over in la and was nominated for the nobel peace prize very smart man we talked about identity what makes a human being and what defines refines us for two hours over a beer i had the company of someone whos mind was just effortlessly stunning three months later he was dead suicide i realized after the conversation we had he slowly became isolated and wound up one fateful night ending his life the conversation i didnt realise at the time was about him so during my stay with my american friend lets call him buzz we decide to go to a party thats local we turn up only to find out that a very close friend of buzz has been raped violently unfortunately this is nothing new to me i am yet to come into contact with a new set of depressing realities which is another story all in itself skip forward an hour and i find my person stood in a driveway of the girls ex boyfriend who has a history of abuse towards women with a baseball bat in my hand this is where i know ive changed as a person im standing in a random persons driveway at 2am in the morning drunk im stood there because nothing inside me will back down from the fact that something wrong happened im looking down the barrel of a gun once again with a weapon in my hand ready to fight and im not even scared i even walk towards him i provoke him as much as i can and even with a loaded weapon i get within striking distance of this guy and he doesnt shoot me his hand just shook i remember him saying how he would kill me and i remember not registering it in his eyes he was terrified this is the point i realised i was not normal i was a monster looking for a fight subsequently he was arrested for rape and prosecuted successfully it was buzz who pulled me away from actually attacking the man in his driveway and rightfully so i needed help but was too proud and damaged to do so i was lost i also need a time out will post more when im ready to do so in an attempt to make my post less monstrous than it already is ill do the last little bit here segment 4 so it was my birthday a few days ago i turned 25 i have the unique answer to all my milestone birthdays them being 16182125 in that nothing happened i sat down on all these days and nobody even noticed its unfortunate considering im there for them that they cant celebrate a quarter of a century of life with me in my life ive shouldered problems from rape victims been there for the birth of an unwanted child to the death of an abusive parent there is quite honestly nothing ive yet to see thats new and i wasnt prepared for any of itive been beaten spat on screamed at cried on and beld on i listened and i cried i wrestled knifes out of peoples hands even had my best friends blood dripping onto me as the wound in his arm is so deep it pissed all over us as i fight to keep him from killing himself in the darkest part of lots of peoples lifes i turn out to be the person who talks you down the thing that upsets me the most is i give a huge amount of energy in being there for total strangers loved ones friends and family when im in need im sat alone again on my birthday with a bottle of champagne i bought myself unwilling to open it as there is nothing to celebrate the only solace that i take from all of this and ive barely started talking about my life is this i was in amsterdam heavily under the influence of many drugs a few months after the africa situation and an old man walked up to me out of the blue he turned to me and said you look angry young man to which i replied im fine please go away thinking for a second the last thing i ever heard this man say was holding anger inside you is like holding onto a hot coal you only burn yourself in keeping it there youll only begin to heal when you let it go he then turned and walked away its taken almost 6 years to completely understand that phrase edit if you can comment let me know what you think i know its slightly mish mash in the way im teling my story but thats just the way it seems to be coming out considering not a soul has heard it before i appreciate your input if youve read this far thank you,pre-pandemic
i was addicted to iv opiates and meth from age 2024 i am now 26 and 2 years sober at the end of my addiction i was in a hospital for 3 months with endocarditis not sure if i would die not sure i cared today i am back in college with a 39 gpa i wake up every day and i feel happy its such a gift i think its important to share stories of success to keep people going it took a long time sober to feel normal again but i really do i never thought i would get better but i was wrong dont give up on yourself dont die on the people that love you keep trying to get sober because whats waiting on the other side is better than anything you could imagine while down in the depths of addiction and depression always here to support anyone fighting for their life,pre-pandemic
people with bpd are abusive and manipulative when someone either knows you have bpd or learns your attachment pattern for them they figure out how easy it is for them to get away with everything for example someone whos your fp figuring out your loyalty to them and that how no matter how much you lose it you come crawling back so theyll be more relaxed about fucking things up because its not easy for you to just leave the relationship forever theyll take advantage of your passion and leave you alone when youre upset does this happen in every relationship no but its not uncommon for someone to learn you have a disorder specifically affecting relationships to learn how to work with that as a result of this im conflicted when it comes to telling loved ones about my mental health,pre-pandemic
this past year was a whirlwind a lot of personal trauma and growth happened im finally on a medication combo that doesnt just mute the bipolar tv but actually turns it off it took me 8 years for my bachelors degree that is not personally fulfilling i occasionally threw around the idea of going premed but those kinds of goals are much too ambitious for someone contemplating suicide almost constantly well i fucking did it i was accepted into my colleges biology program its one of the hardest programs to get into at my school i am taking an intro to ochembiochem this semester and i received a 97 on the first test because i have been studying my ass off for the first time i feel like i have passion for something suicide isnt even in top 5 life plans anymore let along 1 ive been selfharm free for 8 weeks i feel a bit burnt out with work and school and parenting but this is also the best ive felt in my entire life but not in a way that is suspiciousi simply feel content which is something id never thought id say,pre-pandemic

theres how much your body weighs and then theres stuff like water and feces that arent really part of your fatmuscleliving body but still weigh a bunch so if you eat 500kcal per day but it contains lots of sodium and carbs your body will hold more water than usually you are 100 losing fatmuscle but the extra water might make the scale not move or you eat 500kcal per day but thats way too little obviously and longer term restriction has caused your intestines to slow down significantly you havent let out any of that indigestible shitheh and it basically weighs as much as your food youre losing fatmuscle but your scale wont move thats all calories are all that matters and if youre eating an impossibly unhealthily small amount of food youre 1000 losing weight the scale is just not the best arbitur for what youre losing in those two scenarios you can probably do the math and see what you lost in true weight if youre a nerd like me its actually surprisingly accurate considering a 100kcal lower tdee since im uw and has probably caused my thyroid to not work well oh and up to 200 less if youve lost your period,pre-pandemic

i think about it a lot like i imagine how itll play out who would find me the mess it would make how my apartment would likely smell of my decomposing corpse and how that would likely give away what actually happened the process of distributing my stuff and the pain my father and boyfriend would be going through my co workers finding out how they would all act surprised and pretend they never saw this coming do you guys go through the same thing,pre-pandemic
so it finally happened yesterdayi caved and wore a tshirt to work my boss saw my arms and my side when i was getting something off the shelf he saw that i was covered in scars and started asking questions he knows i have ptsd and i dont think he meant to be pushy and make me uncomfortable but it was just rapid fire questions about them for about 5 minutes and then he showed me his scars he told me how he got each one and how he got over the trauma from them he showed me his bullet wounds his burns and his knife wounds and he told me not to get heatstroke by wearing sweaters all summer just for a few scars we talked about his tattoos and what i would want to cover mine with things are getting better,pre-pandemic
whatever mental state im currently experiencing i expect to last from here on and forever and i very obviously ignore the evidential fact that my moods and mental states have and continue to be very diverse my mind thinks that the current way i feel is the way ill feel forever from now on no matter what it makes me feel like i have no ability to even consider changing my mood in this present moment in the slightest because now its my permanent reality for better or worse despite the truth very obviously being the opposite i cant imagine feeling differently in the future from how i feel right now this obviously makes it very difficult for me to convince myself to take positive steps towards bettering my emotional state,pre-pandemic
every single damn day i have to find at least one thing to distract me from the fact that i want to die i dont want to hurt i dont want to suffer i dont want to take anyone with me in the process i dont want to fail at it and end up with some kind of neurological issue or permament physical injury i dont want to hurt the ones who care about me either like my parents i love them but i am just so damn tired of living it would be so nice if i could just fall asleep and not wake up how nice it must be to not have depression to not want to die i cant imagine how nice it must be going a day without fighting my own self,pre-pandemic
umm i thought thats what i was doing but now i feel kind of stupid guess i wont try that again edit hey just to clarify a couple things im seeing quite a few comments along the lines of dont treat people like emotional dumpsters you need a therapist for stuff like that youre making them feel burdened i hear you loud and clear but im talking more about normal just sharing what you are going through with your friends im learning that not all friends want that and i understand but its still tough to hear when its a pattern if you have any specific advice im open to hear it but please be careful how you word things this is a mental health subreddit so ill give you 2 guesses as to how im doing emotionally edit 2 i hate doing edits but felt the need to clarify this after one specific comment after my acquaintancefriend person said this i remained kind to them i dont dislike them at all and dont judge them i respect they have boundaries i simply thought we had a different relationship which if you have bpd im sure you can relate to please dont think i am here to blame or complain about how evil people are i just thought this subreddit would understand that feeling of making this mistake,pre-pandemic
for the past 5 months my fatigue has been very overwhelming worst ive felt in all my life my symptoms are fatigue malaise generally feeling unwell light body aches randomly not all the time very tired sometimes my body feels heavy and unbalanced which then triggers anxiety because i fear i might pass out its so bad i cant focus on life or work i struggle daily to get out of bed few facts about me im 27 171lbs white male 510 fitbit tells me i get around 657 hours of sleep per night i eat alright should eat more veggies i got a cubicle job without windows i drive 1 hour total per day for work i dont excercise much mainly light walking with my dog or in hallways at work i suffer from depression and anxiety i stopped taking the 5mg lexapro cold turkey after being on it for 5 years 2 months or so after i stopped the symptoms and fatigue started i reinstated 05mg lexapro using liquid solution made from water i have only had 1 blood tests in my life at age 26 and i didnt fast they found my vit d was 20ml but everything else checked out i want to die i feel like death if there is a god please show me mercy,pre-pandemic
to me mine just feels like a fairy tale that i tell people when the conversation arises for context im fairly open about explaining what happened it feels distant or cutoff during my explanations to others often it doesnt hit me that it actually happened until i react to a trigger or someone says something that brings it all back i dont know if that made any sense or not feel free to ask for clarification im also undiagnosed as a disclaimer,pre-pandemic
hey i dont think people realize how much strength it takes to pull your own self out of a dark place mentally so if youve done that today or any day i am proud of you do not give up,pre-pandemic
i have always heard how if one is suffering they should reach out so i reached out to my parents after a meltdown its been years since i am in depression nd suicidal nd have anxiety issues i dont share the best relationship with my parents but some part of me still had hopes from them anyway yesterday i cried all day trying to explain to them my situation but they said i am lying nd i have no reason to be depressed about my own parents told me if i am depressed then i probably want to kill myself too so y dont i do it if i really am depressed great solution actually now i might as well go ahead nd do it finally maybe i wont be a liar anymoremaybe i can finally find peace,pre-pandemic
i have been on seroquel for about a month now and i dont remember ever being so functional just today so far i have empty and loaded the dishwasher did a load of laundry made myself french toast for breakfast all while having time to watch 4 episode of anime i even started making some designs to sell as art prints online for passive income which is a much more functional idea for money for an art school dropout than say dressing up as a french maid and cleaning peoples houses admittedly i am still tapering my effexor as well so i probably still have a bit of hypomania but the seroquel has made it so much more manageable and i am actually getting stuff done instead of having a new idea every 30 seconds and growing more and more anxious i cant get it all done tldr god bless actual treatment,pre-pandemic

to start ill tell you my history with adhd throughout my schooling there was a huge gap in my marks between the subjects i was interested in and those that i wasnt in highschool i took a long objective look at my thought process when it came to studying and registering information i noticed that i often experienced a lot of whats commonly called mind fog a failure to grasp a thought process when i had no interest in it this didnt exist for things that i enjoyed quite the opposite periods of hyperfocus would allow me to stay up all night reading articles and forum posts while absorbing all of it with ease whereas sitting down to read a new book i would find myself reading along with my eyes but thinking about something completely different within a page i barely passed highschool and spent a year upgrading my credits afterward it was only after flunking out of college that i took my concerns to a gp and eventually a psychologist who diagnosed me and started me on the path of treatment through medication and lifestyle changes its been about two and a half years since then ive moved and been rediagnosed four additional times ive been prescribed ritalin concerta vyvanse wellbutrin and adderall and through this process ive come to gain a lot of control over my symptoms but also recognize a number of concerns about the diagnostic and treatment process as well as how the conditions viewed by not only those subscribing to the stigma but those who are well researched and diagnosed like many in this sub diagnosis ive never been presented a diagnostic process that didnt begin and end with filling out a one to two page questionnaire about my self observations of mood energy level productivity and self control the first 3 were the exact same one page test about 10 questions asking me to rate myself on a scale of 1 to 10 where the doctor would compare my answers to an overlay chart of answers that corresponded with adhd these questions were incredibly open and simple i immediately noted how easy it would be for a drug seeker to simply tell them what they wanted to hear as soon as my answers matched up with their answer key i was handed a prescription for controlled stimulants the most in depth of these tests was two pages and included similar checklists being filled out by my parents and employer ended up just being my employer as my parents are in a different city again easy to manipulate if i wanted to and a lot of the questions were very vague could have been answered a lot of different ways and still be truthful depending on how i chose to read it ive only had one doctor who drug tested even now that im prescribed 30mg adderall which is fairly rare in canada and on high demand in black market environments my doctor just trusts me i even told him i would be open to drug testing when other first line medications werent working to me this is incredibly frustrating as adhd is so stigmatized as an excuse for lazy students and employees and the medications are so widely abused many many people dont think the condition is real and honestly i dont blame them for a second when getting a diagnosis is this easy theres no question in my mind that a huge percentage of adhd diagnosis probably arent accurate or could be managed with lifestyle changes alone medications shouldnt be handed out this easily even prodrugs and nonaddictive like wellbutrin and strattera should be viewed as an aid to the improvements already gained from a change in sleep patterns diet and exercise above all of this i have complete control over my medications and doses my psych simply asks me if i want to try something else or raiselower the dose im not asked to keep a journal no one around mes asked if theyre observing any improvements side effects or anything i could completely binge out to the point of psychosis from amphetamines and just keep it together enough for a 5 minute appointment every two months and walk away with a higher dose and more pills community im using this sub as an example because its the biggest community of diagnosed people im exposed to regularly ive been shamed for saying this in the past but i constantly find myself rolling my eyes at the posts where a blatant lack of self control and responsibility is excused by ones self as an unfortunate and unchangeable aspect of the adhd brain it seems like an adhd diagnosis immediately becomes a catchall excuse for a lot of people to blame every negative aspect of their personality on and it creates a terrible reputation for those who are actually trying to improve and work past their attention problems i know im not alone when i say im hesitant and embarrassed a lot of the time to admit to someone that i have adhd and usually when i do the persons initial reaction is exactly as i feared and expected ive tried criticizing one of those posts on another account of mine with these same points and was told that i needed to be supportive in this community im sorry but just as i wouldnt support anyone in the healthy at all sizes movement i wont encourage and provide a stage for those who arent willing to improve themselves i dont want this to be a rant theres a lot of awesome people here wanting to learn to improve themselves and work past their symptoms and just as many offering them great advice my intention is to encourage this community to promote a more serious reputation and understanding employ a tough love approach when needed for those who are making excuses and do as much as possible to contribute to further understanding of the adhd mind and how to make it work to their advantage i appreciate the audience and would love to hear your own thoughts and feedback,pre-pandemic
hey all this is my first actual post on this subreddit but ive been struggling bp 2 and all of your posts really help me feel like i can figure this out ive had a really bad bout of depression recently though it tends to get mixed with my hypomanic episodes in a weird way but im happy to say ive gotten a job ive been off of work and struggling to graduate for the last year or so and everyones posts have really helped me get the gumption to get up and try when things get hard i just wanted to thank everyone i dont know anyone close to me with bp so this subreddit has been my secret place to read when things get tough and i know people wont get it if i try to explain it i really credit reading everyones experiences with giving me the gumption to believe i can do it apply for jobs and then get myself out of bed and dress for the interview thank you again everyone as indirect as it was i really appreciate everyone for posting and the mods for putting it all together things got hard and i didnt think i was good enough for anything and you guys gave me perspective and enough just keep trying to get through it thank you,pre-pandemic

i am happy to share with you today that ive gone from an anxiety disorder age 4 adhd diagn age 6 bipolar diagn age 11 bipolar anxiety diagn age 15 autism after overcoming my anxiety disorder i am starting to think that autism is the human brain evolving to our new digital environment its not a mental disorder as much as it is a mental evolution now is the time to make justice a reality for all children of the world i have a dream where autism is the future of human communication thought process and mental health where mental unhealth stops hiding behind the label of mental illness and claiming the mentally disabled for the bad behavior of nonmentallyill humans that choose not to practice the daily chore of mental health where the mentally ill are no longer fuel in the liftoff of humanity towards a mentally healthy future where instead we can identify the mentally unhealthy practices in humanity that plague the mentally ill and the nonmentallyill alike for the first time in history since the mental asylum mental unhealth epidemic i see a future where humanity can break free of their socially acceptable mental unhealthy ways where we cease trying to be most right and focus instead on being more right by letting go of the fears and selfdoubt fueled by the beliefs of what is wrong where the mentally ill and nonmentallyill can walk together in solidarity past the temptation of mental unhealth towards mental health once again autism is not the enemy autism could very well be the key to understanding how the mentally ill can live in harmony without the nonmentallyill in a way never seen in humanity before if we can set aside our differences and instead seek out how we are similar as humans of the world we very well may see a future where the autisticway can help any human become mentally stronger the same way the teachings of healthy eating and exercise help humans today become physically stronger i have a dream that little children will one day live in a world where they will not be judged by the chemistry of their brain but by the content of their character let freedom ring autismisnottheenemy mostrightisneverrightforever notwrong,pre-pandemic
ive posted about this book before on rptsd but it helped me so much i think it bears reposting the book came out in 2015 so its relatively new it was written by a psychologist who attempted to treat ptsd in vietnam veterans in the early 1970s and has been trying to understand trauma of all forms for his entire career it is written partly as a description of his career and the technological developments that helped doctors understand trauma but it also goes into great detail describing the physical mechanisms of trauma and how to overcome them and yes you can overcome them i have ptsd from a near death experience that landed me in a 9 day medically induced coma in trying to recover i kept meeting people talking about energy or memories living in our muscles and it just always felt confusing or vague and even more disempowering this book really demystified a lot of these concepts for me and helped me believe for the first time that not only were my problems understandable but that there were practical things that i could do to move beyond them,pre-pandemic
does anyone else find it annoying when people use the word ptsd as a joke just a few seconds ago i saw a post in my feed about someone having ptsd from their exams i am mildly annoyed by this the person who posted this writes a lot about their struggle with anxiety and depression but then goes ahead and trivializes ptsd,pre-pandemic
not sure if anyone else feels this way when i think of things that will happen in the neardistant future sometimes i cant even imagine them happening and my brain immediately tells me thats because ill prob be dead before it happens not sure if this is common in ha or just my own personal brand of crazy lol,pre-pandemic
so ive always jokingly considered myself having adhd but after doing some more research on the matter im starting to really convince myself that i do have it for instance ive always been an uncontrollably hyperactive child i cant seem to control myself when i get slightly excited or am in a comfortable environment talk too loudly and too fast i always misplace things frequently forget about meetingsclass and lately ive been having trouble paying attention to what somebody is saying when they are talking to me my thoughts wonder elsewhere but my question is where do you draw the line between having adhd and just being an incompetent human being,pre-pandemic
my brother adam died at the age of 23 years old in 2018 he lost the battle to addiction after seven years of being a drug addict adam had the best laugh it was loud boisterous he was tall handsome daring and charming eight years my junior i grew up watching him come into his own i remember him putting on magic shows in the living room one time he wanted to hold my hand on the roller coaster when he was scared adam wanted reassurance that he wasnt too old for that as any big sister would i told him of course it was okay as time went on i grew to be the worrier of the family adam grew up to be a total daredevil jumping off the stratosphere in vegas flying a hot air balloon with my dad and living his life in the fast lane my brother was the kind of guy that grabbed life by the horns and stared fear in the face with a smirk i used to think of him as a cat with many lives because no matter what happened he always came out of the situation unscathed he became a drug addict slowly but with warning signs in the end it seemed like he was overdosing every other day the calls from rehabs and hospitals were relentless the year before he died my parents got a call from california encouraging us all to fly out there he overdosed and his numbers were horrible in this dark time we all prepared to say goodbye to him miraculously he landed on his feet yet again this time the overdose had consequences he passed out on his hands and this caused serious nerve damage he couldnt use his hands for a while but with his first hand surgery he acclimated quite well the doctors said his hands wouldnt recover and that the damage was permanent after about six months he started to get movement back in his hand and to our surprise were told hed make a full recovery i remember him sending me a video of him moving his hands i sat there in awe crying happy tears surely this will all make him wake up and stop using i thought i hoped in times like this hope is the only thing that really gets you through every time something catastrophic happened this was my mindset we never quite got the whole story but i knew things werent looking good he seemed to be spinning faster towards danger and i felt angry that there wasnt a damn thing i could do to stop it in the year or so before he passed away my friend kate who had lost her dad to alcoholism told me to prepare myself for the worst she said she had wished she accepted the fact that he could die before it happened maybe just maybe if i could do that it would help me in the long run i reluctantly took her advice i sat down in my office and really thought about what she said i cried for what felt like forever this harsh but valuable insight from my dear friend helped me beyond words every time i saw my brother i acted as if it could be the last time this has brought me a great amount of peace looking back on things i dont have regrets of what i could have done because i know for sure i tried everything tough love soft love and everything in between of course none of it worked so there is a part of me that feels defeated who am i to impart any wisdom on others there is great peace in being able to look back on things with a clear conscience i never looked at addiction through rose colored glasses i saw it exactly for what it was no matter how difficult it was i remember begging on the phone to his rehab not to let him out because i was worried hed overdose and die i was told there was nothing they can do to keep him there it was his choice to leave id be on the phone from morning to night fighting for answers i spent hours talking to him about his addiction trying to understand it and help him in any way i could i suggested everything i could possibly think of and was there for him anytime he called me id take his calls even when i suspected he was high sometimes hed make no sense and ask for money other times the adam i knew and loved was just calling to say hi i never missed one of those calls most importantly i spent as much time as possible with him and always hugged him extra tight before i left i told him how much i loved him and cherished every second if i had not done this i know for sure id look back with regret something i wasnt prepared for was how permanent death is he flew home from rehab in california and i saw him the day before he died he was back in town to get surgery on his other hand i remember him standing in the driveway on my way out i told him again for the millionth time not to use especially before or after his surgery he agreed not to and i told him i loved him we hugged and i got into my car that was the last time i saw my brother i wanted to write this open letter to anyone that will read it to those who are suffering with addiction and the families around them please know that you are not alone i grew up in the middle class we had a nice house on a culdesac we were taught to love each other no one would have expected what was going on in our lives i want to share a few words of wisdom i have learned along the way take it as you will to those of you in the beginning stages of grief hold on i know you feel like youre drowning and cant catch your breath you will breathe again i promise in the beginning my family took everything ten seconds at a time i cried for months in grocery store lines there were long periods of time where i woke up crying and i went to bed crying i could hardly catch my breath please hang on we had an outreach of support from friends and family in the darkest time of our lives i encourage you to reach out to those that love you and let them take care of you when you need it cry your eyes out i used to hate crying until i realized how healing it is lets be honest i still hate it but i can recognize its undeniable benefits to process grief you have to feel the emotions behind it i promise you wont cry forever crying is good for you and is so incredibly tiring cry yourself to sleep bring tissues everywhere you go and allow yourself to feel whatever it is youre feeling in the moment to anyone suffering with addiction please know you are loved and you are not alone i want you to know that losing a family member to this is the hardest thing ive ever had to do its been a year and a half and i still cry every single day please do everything you can to take the addiction seriously and to get support in any way you can addiction is something a person is suffering with it does not define who they are its easy to judge an addict until you have walked the same path offer kindness and love to the addict instead of judgment that addict is someones family member or best friend all im saying is love goes a lot farther than judgment as humans we are all suffering in some way it makes the world a much better place to offer encouragement love and understanding to a person to families and friends of addicts i see you i know how painful and hard it is to watch someone you love go further down the rabbit hole its a hopeless devastating feeling i wouldnt wish on anyone i try to openly share my story with others you would not believe the amount of people who are dealing with the exact same thing we feel like we need to hide in the shadows because its embarrassing to discuss trust me i get it please remember none of us choose this its something that unfortunately happens way more than it should to those reading this thank you for taking the time to listen to what i have to say i miss my brother every single second of every single day sometimes when i close my eyes i can still hear his laugh on the really tough days that gets me through and to my brother adam fly high i will never forget you allison,pre-pandemic

most everyone here already knows this this is to the people who disbelieve in it and i hope to reach the ignorant or misinformed the insomnia is real no one chooses to stay up all night and go to bed at 4am be tired as hell in the morning and feel like ran over garbage the triggers are real certain movies noises and visuals can cause anger fear anxiety depression and sadness to the point of crying even for noncryers this is due to the feeling of reliving the events the trust issues and suspicions about people are real and dont take it personally ever hear i like to keep most things to my self thats an autoresponse nothing personal the nightmares are real sometimes nightmares of reliving the event and then waking up feeling a chaos of bad emotions often ruining your entire daydays anxiety is real and is often because of insert events creating it for people who didnt have it prior avoiding talking about it and avoiding things that remind you of it doesnt make the problem invalid and arent just faking it its a logical natural coping mechanism to avoid thinking about it an aversion to being physically touched is real ever hear dont touch me or the person is uncomfortable with being touched well the insert event is likely related to that again dont take it personally point being no one fakes anything i listed above for the sake of feeling pity or just playing the victim its a real problem just like anything else and it doesnt only apply to veterans and law enforcement hope i could shed some insight,pre-pandemic

for years i couldnt make it past 3 months now im almost at a year my life has changed in so many beautiful ways i am dually addicted to both drugs and alcohol i was an injection user who had one vein left on my body by the time i made it to detox i remember the nurses had to get approval to draw blood from a vein in my neck because it was the only one left they said there was only 6 patients they have done that to since they opened and still i didnt think i had a problem 15 years of hell 15 years living in a different world because i couldnt handle reality i had to be so high i couldnt walk opiates were my doc but i would do anything you put in front of me i craved that rush you got after injecting an opiate because it was the only time my body relaxed i did one pill after another until i was nodding off and couldnt keep my eyes open long enough to cook up another crawling around on the floor with a flashlight trying to find loose beads because im so dope sick all i could think is how pathetic am i i overdosed i died for 2 mintues and they brought me back and i still argued with the doctor to go home so i could keep using i lied and said i wasnt using even though they showed me my tox screen my life was so unmanageable i was a complete mess who lost all empathy compassion and love for other people and myself today i look in the mirror and love who i see today i am honest today i make an honest living instead of selling myself just to get by today i make others smile instead of cry today i am me and that demon is losing every day that i go to bed clean i never thought id be where i am today and i never thought i could be happy while sober i promise you you can do it you are not alone and the pain you are afraid to feel is only temporary once you begin to feel and process those emotions your life is worth living and no matter what you did in active addiction it doesnt define you you are a good person you deserve happiness and you deserve a life free from your addiction i know it feels impossible especially when you are withdrawling but recovery is possible you can do it just take it one minute at a time im always here for anyone that wants to vent im proud of all of you and i hope you find your path to recovery it really is worth it wishing all my fellow addicts another 24,pre-pandemic

its not the disease of drug addiction its the disease of addiction when i was in active addiction even as a hardcore addict i never believed addiction was a disease after all i made the choice to use drugs for the first time like so many of us which is most often the argument made by non believers however when i made the choice to work on my recovery i realized i am not just a drug addict i am an addict the drug addiction is not the disease its the disease of addiction disease of the mind diseased thinking i used to believe it was the drugs that were my only issue however now that i no longer use any mind altering substances ive come to realize that my thinking is the issue my obsessive compulsive hyper focused mind i now see clean that my disease will manifest itself in so many ways daily if i am not actively seeking my recovery as aggressively as i seeked my next fix ive come to realize i cannot do anything even the healthy things without it making my life unmanageable whether it be food the gym karate kick boxing yoga relationships and even my recovery too much of anything is not good for this guy and that is what makes me an addict that is the disease of addiction again not drug addiction as drugs were just a symptom of my disease i also look back on my life and realize i was an addict well before i tried my first drug including alcohol i was addicted to many things both healthy and unhealthy as a young kidteen i was always the child that could never stop after one pop tart or one oreo i had to have the whole box ultimately we must give up on the debate on whether it is a disease or not because all it does is divide us we create the division and that does not get us closer to resolving the issue of addiction and many issues that go on in the world we must come together because nearly everyone has been affected by addiction one way or another and some of us havent even come to realize it yet so whether you feel pity for the addict in active addiction or not is irrelevant whether you believe its a disease or not is also irrelevant all i ask is that you try to understand that it is everywhere around us and when that person you love comes clean and asks for help put your pride and ego aside and lend them your hand because my hand will always be out for anyone who needs it,pre-pandemic

so i beat my friends to their apartment last night after we all left the bar from celebrating said friends birthday i waited a few minutes in my car first time visiting the new place didnt know which apartment was theirs and then called them twice they didnt answer i waited another 5 minutes and immediately started splitting without doing my own research on bpd and the symptoms i never wouldve been able to catch this one thing would have led to another and i probably wouldve just gone home angrily thinking that they ditched me i suddenly realized that i was demonizing my friend in my head devaluing but im a fan of evil shit and getting worked up i immediately split him into the category of toxic person which makes me want to run and hide i noticed this and kept calm i acknowledged my emotions and let myself feel them but also told myself that they were uncalled for and that i just needed to be patient lo and behold they were in a dead zone and called me back all this splitting happened in just a few minutes but i disassociate into my own brain too hard sometimes and it felt like forever im so proud of myself for checking my rollercoaster brain for what feels like the first time,pre-pandemic
i have been meaning to talk about my experience with wellbutrin and this seems as good a time as any wellbutrin was the first thing my doctor prescribed for me when i was diagnosed earlier this year he has had success with it with other adult adhd patients im 28 i started on it around halfway through december i didnt feel any immediate any effects but i figured that it might take awhile to build up in my body after four days i left with my wife and kids to go stay at the inlaws over christmas i forgot my pills so i had a forced break for a few weeks week 1 i started on the pills again as soon as i came home but i still did not notice any improvements after six days what i did notice however was that i was kinda itchy the location seemed to vary from hour to hour and places that i scratched welted up after ten minutes or so week 2 on day seven of continued wellbutrin intake i spent the entire workday absent mindedly scratching the hell out of my hands that evening they were twice their normal size and incredibly painful the next day i discovered that i could draw wonderful pictures and profanity laced diatribes on my arm with a fingernail and in a few minutes my artistry would appear in glorious 3d that finally convinced me that something might actually be wrong so i coerced my still swollen fingers into dialing my doctors clinic he agreed that i might be experiencing an allergic reaction to the wellbutrin and told me to stop taking it and to get some benadryl for the swelling on the way home from work i had a little tickle in the back of my throat but it was winter and i had been fighting off a cold for a few weeks so i thought nothing of it once home i ate some food and attempted to watch more than two minutes of any one tv show after finally settling on an episode of adventure time i heard a slight whistling sound but it did not distract me for long halfway through the show i realized that my breathing was wheezy i heroically pressed on in my vegetative endeavors until met with the unignorable conclusion that i was having trouble breathing as my family was still out of town i considered driving myself to the hospital but as most of you will probably agree waiting rooms are a special kind of hell for adhders so i instead decided to pop a few benadryl and went to bed over the next few days i managed to link coughing with my throat swelling up so i stopped coughing as much as possible and took benadryl when required week 3 the doctor was still concerned that the reaction did not seem to be abating so he prescribed me a few heavy doses of antihistamines they got rid the itching and swelling but put me in a profound and constant stupor so i stopped taking them after four unproductive days the next afternoon i felt the beginnings of that familiar itch on my arms but it faded over the rest of the day and did not come back conclusion so here is what i learned from this adventure 1 stop taking new medication at the first sign of an allergic reaction 2 antihistamines make me tired 3 dont go to sleep in an empty house without the full use of your trachea ive been on dexedrine for a week now so i hopefully that means that i am in the clear and will not be repeating that experience again tldr procrastination in dealing with the side effects of wellbutrin to help curb my procrastination forced me to take antihistamines that exacerbated my procrastination stldr procrastiception edit while the title seemed a great idea when i was writing it i have since come to loathe it and everything it stands for,pre-pandemic

ive been 12 days sober since i had an experience that scared me i was watching the patriots vs titans game at a bar alone because i couldnt get it to stream on my tv im a 29 year old female and i am fairly sociable i ended up making some new acquaintances and having several drinks with my new found fellow patriots fans i remember being at the 1st bar after the game and then things get really hazy i know i walked next door to the other bar and then the night is lost i have about 810 hours of unaccounted time i know there was another bar after that because of transactions on my bank card i have no receipt for an uber or lyft i woke up the next morning in my apartment with no memory of getting there with an opened condom wrapper on my night stand there was a condom in my trash can but it looked like it had been put on but not really used if you know what i mean physically it did not feel like i had intercourse in that blackout period i also woke up with a big bruise on my knee bloody knee cap and an extremely painful elbow meaning i had a pretty hard fall that i obviously dont remember the blackout i experienced was slightly terrifying and i know i am lucky because that stranger could have done whatever they wanted to me and i would have woken up with no idea who they were i still dont know who this guy was but im glad he made the decision to not completely take advantage of me this experience has motivated me to reevaluate my relationship with alcohol i work in sector of health care radiology where we are constantly treating people for horrible alcohol related pathology sorry if im ranting but its just good to get this out thanks for reading,pre-pandemic

12 years ago yesterday i called 911 thinking i was going to die from drinking 35 days in a row the fire engines showed up and asked me what was going on i told them i was an alcoholic and that i couldnt seem to quit drinking my brother lives in the same town and i texted him saying i was headed to the er he came over and picked me up instead of the ambulance people taking me saved some money there they detoxed me for about 7 hours and with ivs in my arms and sensors on my chest i was scratching my head on how i ended up in the er it was from 1 beer i drank on dec 19th 2007 i then made a decision after staring at a gray wall for a few hours that i was an alcoholic and couldnt drink anymore i left there about 7pm that night on jan22 2008 and went home not knowing how i would live this new life of sobriety this was my bottom as i had struggled from 20052008 with the alcohol consumption sky rocketing losing jobs and near death experiences i had had enough i started drinking when i was 14 i was 43 in 2008,pre-pandemic
who else became really good at seducing men as a way to control them in order to survive i was sexualized starting as a child from my father through mostly covert sexual abuse the way i survived was by seducing and flirting with him my mom was out to get me and the way i learner to receive love was by seducing it became a way for me to get control in an unsafe situation if i got the man to develop a crush on me distract them and become infatuated i was more able to control them so i was safe i notice this pattern will come out especially around unsafe and angry men ive done this technique when i felt i was being discriminated against too it gets the men to let their guard down be nicer to me and get what i want because to them i am flattering their ego and playing submissive obviously this is maladaptive coping mechanism that i am unlearning but yeah i realized recently it has helped me survive racism and sexism and to avoid others aggression i also realized i liked how it kept me safe and gave me power in an unsafe situation it gave me power over my abusers and i was able to punish men by seducing them and rejecting them and keeping myself safe sometimes i think about about becoming a stripper because i am really good at seducing and making myself into a mans dream girl who else relates,pre-pandemic

before you read my true story i want you to know that im not very good at english as its my second language so bare with me if i have made grammatical mistakes or anything and honestly i really havent opened up about this incident in my life until today anyway this one random late night in march 2017 i decided to download the tinder app probably the worst decisions in my life but im genuinely a introvert person so its hard for me to make conversation on spot to get to know people most people hop on tinder to troll some to get laid but i was on it to find true love fast forward to two months of most girls wanting to just party or i was to boring to form a conversation this one random day i got super liked by this girl named laura we both started to talk we both had a lot of similarities between us and she was literally 2 miles away from my place it had been 2 weeks we both still havent meet but our conversations started to get more personal and i felt a real connection between us two we both replied long it used to take me a good 45mins to an hour to reply it was just how it was it was however odd for me that she was really beautiful and i was a ugly mf she came from a small town family where as me i was a city kid from a wealthy family although she didnt know that for along time after the 2 weeks of talking we both decided to meet up for lunch like when i say she was simple she had no idea about brands or anything i dressed up with some yeezy 750s she didnt even know them and some part of me liked that she was like that because most of the times i only wore to show off to feel rich to feel accepted one thing about being rich is that the definition of happiness is so different to what a average person would say like an average person has aspirations of having a nice house a nice car nice gadgets and all but its different being born wealthy like i had everything that anyone would aspire of having its different when you have everything anyway that just made me like laura more because she was a simple person a bit mysterious and i was always curious to know more about her we ended up dating for 6 months and i knew she was the one for me she was beautiful she loved me for who i was i didnt have to pretend to be this cool dude like i did with my friends she loved the sensitive little bitch i was everything was going well till jan 2018 she called and cried her father was diagnosed with lung cancer at a bad stage the doctors said they could cure it but he would only survive for a couple of months laura was going through some tough times but i was always with her trying to make her strong she would tell me stories about her dad like how they used to horse ride back when they used to live on farm lands and how he would work 14 hours everyday just his both daughters could have the life that every other kid had tbh that got me so depressed like the fact that her father sacrificed so much for his kids and all but no matter what had happened over the next few months years or the next decade or so i said to myself that i would always be with laura and i wanted to marry her we got back to our casual routines she was getting better and better and on her birthday 11th of march i proposed to her i honestly didnt know if it was the right time or not but i felt like i needed to tell her that im gonna be committed and not just saying it but i wanted to show her laura said yes cried and hugged so hard that i thought she would break my bones but i knew that this meant a lot to her april 11th 2018 this part is going to be hard for me as i am typing my fingers are twitching im really scared because to say it out is something i havent done anyway on this very day i picked up laura we were driving to the hospital to visit her dad we went on the highway till this high speeding car prolly doing 150kmph tried to overtake a vechile in front of us so we were behind this car but suddenly suddenly the person slammed the brakes and dropped back causing me to smash into the car after this moment i dont remember a thing it felt like i died i could hear my surroundings but i couldnt see anything idk how long or anything i woke up and the first thing i asked was what happened to laura and my mum started to cry but i thought she was crying for me i kept asking and no one replied then it hit me it hit me that shes not alive and i couldnt understand it all happened in a flash of a second the love of my life was gone and i could do nothing about it i didnt know how to take it in it fucked me up i only had minor injuries but i was mentally dead fast forward to a month i still was in shock infact i still am i went to visit her family to apologies but couldnt even let out a word just cried out loud but somehow they understood my pain lauras dad seemed to be weaker her mum always had a smile on but she looked so bad she was in shock and it just made me feel worse and worse a week later i found out that lauras dad had passed away i wasnt ready for the funeral i didnt go to lauras too because i couldnt accept it but my mum told me that i had to go to comfort her mum but lauras mum had completely changed she didnt want to hear anything from anyone because two of the most people in her life had passed away and i honestly could do nothing but cry looking at her fast forward it to now there hasnt been a day i felt that i could have done better i could have reacted better and if i had turned the other way maybe i could have died instead of laura maybe she survived she could have been with her dad for the rest of time maybe seeing her daughter would have kept him alive for a bit longer maybe the mum would have been brave having her daughter around i know its not my fault ive heard people say that constantly its not fault bro but i could have done better to prevent it and that is stuck in my mind and always will i honestly have no hope for life i just want to die i cant get over these thoughts i just hope i die real soon its not that i want sympathy but i just cant deal with it it hurts,pre-pandemic
its difficult for me to even say this but i feel it to be very true i lived in that world for many years lost brothers to violence constant worry and fear that you will be next things of that nature much of which begins at a fairly early age 15 years old for myself it often times feels as though society as a whole does not give a damn about those of us who survive to be productive adults which leads many to go undiagnosed and afraid to seek help at 35 years old i have been fortunate enough to reach out to deal with the many traumatic events that have plaqued my mind for years just yesterday learning a name for what i have been experiencing since i left all that behind at 29 years of age while it feels good to know a name for thishypervigilance i think in todays day and age people who have walked similar paths should not be ashamed to ask for help and also be accepted in a sense we know the things in are past are wrong and immoral many of us have payed for our sins in more ways than one would think just a rant and i appologise to anyone i have offended thank you,pre-pandemic

now i realize that selfdiagnosis might be a bit of a touchy subject to some people and maybe thats what the seeking diagnosis flair the one i happen to be using myself since well its the most accurate one at the moment is meant to accomplish to some degree but with such a wide range of flairs on this subreddit i find it a bit odd that selfdiagnosed with disorder arent present although i dont exactly think that parentsiblingfriend of someone selfdiagnosed with disorder should be a thing sincethats just a little too word in my eyes but what do i know i get that selfdiagnosis is far from accurate and in the case of someone like me itd be only temporary because i do have appointments scheduled but not everyone is in the same position as me in some areas of the world said diagnosis might be too expensive or they might be in a particular family situation where people refuse to let them be diagnosed for one reason or another so while it wouldnt be not an urgent addition i think it would be fairly beneficial to the noninsignificant amount of people who havent beencant be diagnosed professionally v,pre-pandemic
i remember getting accommodations for my college courses with my adhd and while talking with the people in the offices and in the forms i had to sign in order to get these accommodations the word disability constantly popped up personally this kind of hit me hard and i was kind of pissed off when they refer to adhd as a disability sure lifes a lot harder with adhd but comparing it on the same level to people with literal retardation down syndrome autism and whatever on the same level kind of made me mad,pre-pandemic
i am so beyond tired of waking up day in and day out to these negative and intrusive feelings and thoughts being played on repeat in my head its to the point where ive been giving more and more thought to just disappearing from peoples lives not even saying goodbye just disappearing obliterating every real connection that i have so i can slip further and further into solitude maybe i just want to make it easier for when i finally decide to off myself i dont know what i do know is that everything feels so pointless i cant stop feeling numb and empty i just want to sever all my ties and connections so i can be alone so i can selfdestruct alone i cant even remember a time where i felt ok i dont think ill ever feel ok again and its not ok to feel this way no one should ever ever have to feel this way ever but yet some of us do and it fucking sucks i wish i could just absorb all the bad feelings everyone in the world has and just take them with me to the grave,pre-pandemic
