my 30m girlfriend 31f and i are finally separating after 45 years together and 25 years living together although the actual moving out process is very messy it has been a huge relief for me to not feel responsable for solving her problems and i can solely focus on myself for the first time in a long time three months ago she asked for space for herself triggered by events outside our relationship which then turned into her wanting to move out then eventually breakup during the process she started regularly seeing another guy and eventually spending a long weekend away with him in a different city this was the breaking point for me and gave me clarity to go ahead and move on as she could only apologize for how she handled telling me not for what she was doing although it is difficult seeing her in this deep depressive state and i intend to end on good terms with her i feel like i was delaying her process of getting help and am hopeful this will help her reach out to her friends and start back regularly with therapy again,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

hey guys thought i would post to just vent so i am a natural introvert and have had massively intense social anxiety my entire life i have always felt that there was this mental barrier preventing me from truly expressing myself i spent all of high school in absolute isolation because of my fear and bitterness of people i went on a mormon mission right after graduation because why the fuck not and it was there that i was able to gain a huge ton of social skills basically being thrown in the deep end and forced to talk to people nonstop all day kinda does that but when i got home i felt like i was going in the same routine i finally had the skills needed to interact with people but i found myself prefering isolation after every interaction my brain would pinpoint all the things i did wrong and it just felt easier to hide than to deal with those failures sorry didnt mean to vent but i find myself slipping back into depression every day and its fucking terrifying,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,0

i am lonely as i am sure most of the subscribers of this subreddit are too but the absolute worst thing about it is not that i am alone it is the feeling that there will never be anyone to share what ive been through with it just amplifies the loneliness and adds a whole new layer of fuck you to the situation and im pretty certain that professional help would be ineffective too as there has never been a particularly useful visit to the psychiatrist about it ive gotten help for my anxieties my depression and every other problem ive had but every time i go to a psychiatrist about loneliness the reaction seems to be somewhat lukewarm as if it is not a problem on the same scale as depression or anxiety etc where the hell does the additude towards loneliness come from where its no worth as much as a problem as some others may be i can tell you that it is the single most fucked up thing ive gone through and yet ive had the least help for it and i really fear that it will stay that way,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1

when i talk with someone for a while i suddenly dont want to reply to them anymore for no reason most of the times people dont do anything to upset me or make me want to stop talking to them the simplest way i can describe how i feel when i see a message and my brain goes nope is boredom its not like i dont care about these people if they got hurt or something happened to them i would feel bad buti just dont reply to them when i do that i dont even feel bad whats wrong with me i know i care about them but apparently its not enugh for me to feel the urge to talk with them x200b edit when i stop replying this goes on for several months until i feel the urge to talk to someone again and i dont have the guts to text someone again after ignoring them for so much time when i wasnt even feeling bad or anything,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0
