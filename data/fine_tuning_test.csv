i am still at the beginning of the divorce process 2 months of physical separation nobody filled in 10 years of relationship and 7 of marriage and its the worst thing that ive ever experienced however i believe that there is always something to learn from our experiences that will help us grow into a better human being so what are your learnings here is mine to love sometimes means to let go to let them go their own path even if its divergent from yours my husband initiated the divorce he left for another woman and to still love him in this situation means that i have to let him go i also think that this is how i contributed to the end of marriage not willing to let go of some things that were hard for me so now its time to learn that and when the time will come that i will process my emotions then to forgive them but you cannot force that like you cannot force love you need to trust the process and be in it,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0
reflecting on a past toxic relationship it clicked people who on and off block you from social medias when in a fight or upset with you are one of the most toxic people let me tell ya why 1 they assume that they are the only source of happiness in the other persons life 2 activity trying to hurt someone they say they love which if you truly love someone hurting them is the last thing you would want to do no matter how angry you are at them 3 they are basically saying fuck you 4 they take away the balance of equality a relationship shouldhas create 5 they are so conceited its sadhilarious at the same time 6 it shows lack of maturity communication is part of the foundation of a healthy relationship by cutting someone off it not only says i dont care how you feel or what you have to say it also says i lack the maturity to put my anger aside and hear you out so we can fix this id love to hear everyones thoughts on this,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1

every business should be providing at least 2 days per year as mental health days especially in businesses where your employees are dealing with the public face to face the amount of crap we have to deal with especially nowadays where people find it appropriate to treat those in customer service like we dont matter is ridiculous i am a covid screener at a ltch and i am now dealing with extreme anxiety depression its not as simple as finding a new job or breathing through the anxiety attacks these days should be mandatory so we can have that extra day to breath and recoup sometimes so we dont get to a point of having to take a medical leave for stress or having to be medicated or worse my 2 cents mental health is so important and if we arent doing well mentally then everything suffers,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

hi everyone some of you may have already guessed depending on your timezones but this sub is not going to be participating in the reddit blackout protests for the next few days these protests to make it short reflect widespread outrage over reddits decision to charge large fees for some thirdparty apps to continue accessing the platform many subs across the site starting today through the next few days including very large subs and much smaller ones are setting their content to private in protest which means only preapproved users can access the sub at all the decision to not participate in the blackouts has nothing to do with the protests themselves or what they stand for but instead the fact that this sub is a critical resource for people in very dangerous and traumatic situations and as such i do believe it would also be dangerous to restrict access to the sub for so long or at all thanks everyone,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

recently ive been having these incidents on average 45 times a day where for some seconds il have this intense feeling of loneliness and il feel it directly in my chest almost like a feeling of my heart sinking it usually lasts about 5 seconds around and almost always happens as im waking up or going to bed and maybe once or twice during the day it could just happen once when it happens and go away or happen 2 or 3 times in rapid succession the feeling is very defeating and usually results in me crying momentarily ive never felt this way exactly before only started happening around 2 months ago i guess its probably the result of being lonely for a while im 19 and never had a real gf or relationship so that probably has to do with it the feeling itself is pretty powerful i imagine its what heartbreak feels like i feel like if i were hugging somebody it would just go away when its happening if it gives anyone here an idea of what it feels like so yeah is this common for anyone else,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0

life has always been such an abstract concept to me and i never got over it one is supposed to grow up figure out how to provide for themselves maybe have kids and in the end die apart from the supposed joy and pleasure in between its ultimately a meaningless endeavor in the grand perspective of things its clear that most people just find a way to accept that premise without contemplating or really putting much thought into it because that is just the normal how its supposed to be and anything else is wrong but really that premise isnt any worse than the one im living right now ive just been stuck for so many years pushing away everyone and everything waiting for a tomorrow where i would feel better where id be free from anxiety and be able to do something with my life anything different but theres never consequence without action and the price for tomorrow is my own effort but why make effort when today isnt that bad maybe ill try after tomorrow or maybe ill get lucky,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1

so this is coming form a person with adhd and depression when i think of happiness i think of those moments that i sometimes get at night where i feel like im on top of the world and everything feels great the thing is when i look at people around me from the outside at least it seems like everyone is depressed i never hear anyone mention how great life is and i would think that if i would be happy i would at least it could be because of my adhd daydreams and fantasies where i think happiness is like living in some fantasy movieesque world to be honest its kind of depressing and makes me not want to get treatment because it doesnt seem like anyone is really happy and all adhd meds would do is make my motivation more consistent and flat sometimes i think everything is kind of fake and pointless and happiness is just a bunch of chemicals moving around in your brain maybe its just my depression making me feel hopeless im just hoping meds will just make me feel normal,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1

to me loneliness is when i am in a conversation to hide my feelings and talk about some shallow nonsense loneliness is when i am on my headphones 8 hours a day loneliness is when i know that i need to talk to people to get away from my loneliness but dont have the strength to do it instead loneliness is when i would rather talk to a dog that does not understand me loneliness is when i dont embrace the culture i was born into loneliness is when my therapist said disliking the desires of my own subconscious mind was basically denying the human condition not wanting to live and i thought that was spot on but i laughed instead and didnt say nothing loneliness is when i have masturbated to porn and admit that i have submitted to what schopenhauer calls will to life the primal force in everyone to procreate loneliness is when i realize that being with someone doesnt make you less lonely loneliness is when i realize that what i have been doing is essentially a distraction to my loneliness thank you for reading what is loneliness to you,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

as someone who is trying their hardest to recover and become clean from self harm its really hard when im being recommended videos of girls showing off their scars or having their scars in random videos with no trigger warning might i add and seeing comments of people saying same or the scars are such a mood it really hurts me i can tell that people that are young are currently being influenced by these dumbass trends thats not spreading awareness that is encouraging self harm it breaks my heart for people who see that assume that self harm is a normal coping mechanism and that its okay for them to start as harsh as this is coming from someone trying to fight the urges it is not normal to harm yourself to cope your brain is in an incredibly unhealthy state we should not be normalizing sh destigmatizing yes normalizing hell no,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1
