to begin with i am a 6ft hispanic tan skinned skinny male living in the states my whole life ive always had attraction from women but i always was too deathly afraid and timid to talk to any women i have talked to women before but if its a woman whose interested in me i become a mess i know my traits mean nothing unless i actually utilize them but ive had different types of women shown me interest my parents never cared about me and my mom would always harass me because i never got my girlfriend and even today when i asked her why her and my dad never taught me to talk to girls she said not my problem to make matters worse ive been dealing with a pornmasturbation addiction since i was 8 im 26 now soon to be 27 my porn addiction started out relatively tame then as time went on it spiraled out of control and lately i have been watching some very unhingeddangerous type of porn throughout highschool i had no girl show me interest apart from one which i really fumbled the bag with it it took me years for me to stop thinking about her started my second job after leaving highschool and things just went crazy a year after starting my job i had this one girl who was absolutely crazy about me and was the most beautiful woman i have ever met and throughout my time working there i was having a different girl show me romantic interest every few months i hope i dont sound like im exaggerating or bragging or whatever but i really did well fast forward to now and that beautiful woman i met who continued to show me interest the past 6 years i cut contact with her a few months ago i never was confident in myself and still am i was always picked on at school and my mom would yell at me whenever i told her i was being bullied instead of doing something life went on and all the girls who were interested in me flirting with me showing me signs moved on and left it wasnt until 2020 when we got this new girl in my store a very short tanskinned hispanic short hair tomboy at first our relationship was very strained as she was very nasty with me then later on her behavior with me changed i thought she was the cutest girl ever my coworker very much noticed how much she liked me she tried every trick to get my attention but i was too scared eventually i noticed her disappointment and felt bad about it then shortly after she left and when i realized she was gone i fell into a heavy depression as she was a one of a kind girl and i was never going to get an opportunity to meet someone like her again i had trouble sleeping each night and eventually the only way i found to sleep was to imagine scenarios with random women i have been doing this for about two years now well last year in the beginning of the year my neighbors youngest kidi live in a duplex house moved back in and brought his girlfriend with him and ended up being the absolute worse year of my life she would ramp up the volume of the tv almost every night i begged my parents to do something about it but my mom would get frustrated at me it went on with the kid and girl being total fucking assholes whenever they could intentionally ramping up the noise when i come home or my parents come home from work making noise until 2 or 3 in the morning other bunch of nonsense the noise however did stop around late december but because of all the noise i have anxiety and lately i have been hearing random high pitched noises from them and its been messing with me i hate everything about my life and wished i could just live a boring life in a boring body im sorry for this massive amount of text but for anyone who reads this thank you very much,post-pandemic,0.33979806,0.11336756,0.5332955,0.8518028,0.7572534,0.88033545,0.10015484,0.5348786

can someone explain why some scientists believe that somemany of depression cases are caused by inflammation whats the mechanism my understanding is that you can still feel bad and be anxious without being depressed but once inflammation messes up your critical brain regions responsible for energy motivation and impulse control thats when depression sets in am i thinking in the right direction because it makes a lot of sense personally because i remember years ago things were really bad even worse than right now and i was extremely anxious and had frequent panic attacks now i dont get panic attacks at all but im really feeling the depression ie i have no energy to do even the simplest tasks like brushing my teeth and thinking anything more complicated than 22 is extremely energy draining etc so it makes sense that for a long time my brain was bombarded by inflammation due to my anxieties but i still had energy because my brain was still more or less healthy but now that the damage has been done im like a zombie,post-pandemic,0.07234184,0.19810994,0.10892116,0.3863517,0.12693603,0.66229004,0.10828526,0.13854301
i am in high school and have a sister in 5th grade she has tried to commit before and has now been to therapy and is on antidepressants i have also struggled with depression but much less extreme i have only cut myself a few times when i have gotten very angry and i have never been suicidal i overall have learned to live with it as my family does not suspect anything and i will never be asking for help me and my sister get into arguments very often because while she is treated very carefully by my family and everyone is ok with her acting out when i do it people assume i am just doing it to antagonize in our fights she states that i am the reason she is the way she is even though when we get along she admits this is false and my mom will believe it and say i am manipulative like my dad i just got screamed at and grounded because me and my sister got in another fight when she was home and my mom without my sister even telling her this assumed i made fun of her for her hospitalization which i absolutely did not do whenever i get into fights with my mom i act out violently whether that is trying to hurt her if she provokes it breaking something or hurting myself i wish my family could know that i do not act out of malice but rather because i also share problems but i know if i told anyone they would say that my problems do not compare to my sisters even when i am having breakdowns in front of my mom she laughs i dont know what to do,post-pandemic,0.613687,0.18764004,0.04710371,0.4200577,0.055623207,0.5725614,0.21745107,0.21063124
tldr my mental health has gotten worse over the past few years to the point i had to drop out of university my friends have a hard time grasping the concept of depression and why i cannot keep up with them they are doing very well in life both socially and academically despite me being in treatment for my mental health i am not getting better therefor i cant even tell them that im making progress healthwise which feels very bad while they are hitting milestones in life i am stuck i now got invited to a party which i do not intend to attend im embarrassed because i feel like a failure in life x200b some background information the friends that im talking about in this post are friends from university i have other friends who struggle with depression themselves too but this particular situation concerns my friend group from uni ive struggled with depression for more than 10 years but it got really bad about 2 years ago since then i havent been able to keep up with university or my social life while my friends make progress in life academically as well as socially i fall behind more and more i cant even say what im doing wrong because i have tried so hard to improve my mental health ive been in therapy on meds even in the mental hospital and whilst my depression did improve periodically i always end up severly depressed again im currently still on meds last year it got so bad that i had to drop out of university i dont like my life im not interested in anything anymore i turn down friends who ask to hang out and barely go outside anymore basic tasks like doing the dishes going grocery shopping and taking out the trash are exhausting getting out of bed and eating something other than toast is a huge accomplishment for me nowadays i dread having to answer text messages and most of the time it takes me a couple of days or weeks to text back ive always been someone who hated it when people took so long to respond but now theres so much shame surrounding small talk and answering questions about my health that i procrastinate it about a week ago i got a text from a friend of mine who invited me to her party which is at the end of this month our friend group is going to be there and some people who i havent talked to since i fell behind in university i had to retake a bunch of classes and then took a break from uni due to my depression and social phobia getting worse which is why i now havent talked to these people in ages i instantly knew that i wouldnt be going but i couldnt bring myself to text back because what would i even reply last year i managed to go to two of my friends birthday parties which were very draining and awkward even though it was nice to see them again im super grateful that my friends still try to include me but i cant help but feel so stupid among them while everyone else shares pictures from their last vacation or talks about their new job or even the house that theyre starting to build i can just sit there and be happy for them while simultaneously hurting on the inside for being such a failure in life i have nothing to contribute nothing to tell them about me because nothing remotely exciting happens in my life and they dont understand that me not having a job or going to university doesnt mean i get to relax all day and have fun its like they cant grasp the concept of depression in the beginning when i was still able to socialize now and then my friends would show an interest in my life and ask me how im doing every now and then but they were never able to relate to my situation which is positive in itself because theyre not mentally ill and im grateful that they are healthy but it has also gotten me some comments and questions that kinda stung for instance when i had to take a break from university because my mental health was in such a poor condition that getting out of bed was my biggest challenge one of them straight up asked me so what are you doing now all day long implying that i had so much spare time now that i didnt attend classes im 100 aware that she had no ill intentions and merely asked out of curiosity but it still felt like such a punch in the gut and the worst thing is that i didnt even have a proper answer what do i do all day long i mostly lay in bed i cry i dissociate sometimes i spend hours doomscrolling on my phone or staring at the wall and if i have a good day i might be able to go grocery shopping or clean my flat ive tried explaining to them what i struggle with but i can tell they dont know how to respond ive gotten numerous hope you get well soons which they later followed up by asking if im feeling better yet obviously mental illnesses are not the same like a cold or a virus but i know that my friends had good intentions and tried to check in with me due to me not attending social events and being unable to do the things they like to do for fun clubbing going out to eat or grab drinks eventually we grew apart i hardly talk to them anymore which i think is mostly my fault but even if i wasnt depressed i wouldnt enjoy big gettogethers or sitting in a busy restaurant to update each other on ones latest achievements my adhd makes sensory processing very hard so bars clubs and restaurants are truly a nightmare for me and i stopped forcing myself to go there for other peoples sake all of them study full time while also holding down a parttime job yet they still find time for their pets hobbies andor relationships i have none of that im sure they have their own struggles as well they just cant relate to mine and as a result i feel like i have to defend myself for not keeping up ive noticed that the reason why i turned down their invitations lately is that i feel less than them and like an underachiever catching up with them leaves me drained and afraid that theyll talk about me behind my back seeing this written out feels so silly because they have always been kind to me and never activitely made me feel bad for missing out on parties etc when i got this text message with the invitation i instantly felt the urge to explain myself to prove that im not turning them down because i dont want to hang out with them but because im not well enough to socialize i guess a part of me is afraid that theyll stop reaching out and i want them to know that i appreciate them thinking of inviting me still which i always tell them anyway but i also dont want to give them this false illusion of me being able to attend parties in a few months or suddenly not being depressed anymore while i do think that i eventually might be interested in meeting friends 1 on 1 again i dont think ill ever go back to attending social events that make me uncomfortable due to their nature busy gettogethers with people talking all over each other lots of small talk alcohol loud music people i dont know but thats the kind of socializing this friend group enjoys im embarrassed because after all this time of being depressed and having gotten all kinds of help im still running in circles while my friends have actual lives and are hitting milestones my health is not improving and im afraid of being misunderstood or judged back when we were all going to university together i really enjoyed seeing them every day and loved hanging out with them after class i think the main difference is that back then we had stuff in common that we could talk about assignments papers sometimes we used to study together and other times we discussed relationship issues or plans for the weekend i dont know what to reply to the invitation other than im not coming should i explain myself again and say that im not doing well should i lie and pretend im busy on that day i have a hard time guessing whether they are even interested in hearing my excuses anymore x200b thank you for taking the time to read and respond all advice is

ive gone through i guess phases of depression for years right now im really not doing good i am really unhappy with pretty much everything in my life and feel like a burden to everyone around me it feels even worse because my parents provide me with a nice car and my own room while helping me get through college i know lots of people would love to have the life i have and im grateful for all the material things but im just still unhappy i woke up today and just felt off for no reason ive just been kinda zoned out and depressed all day and i really dont know why well when i came home the first thing my mom says to me is i look miserable and asks whats wrong with me this happens regularly and ive talked with both my parents about my feelings before i give the usual nothing im fine response but she kept saying im lying and pushing me to tell her but i honestly cant think of why im feeling the way i feel i kinda snapped back and said nothing is wrong and that i honestly dont have an answer well that wasnt good enough so i gave a break down of my day which was a normal day at school where nothing eventful happened she then got mad and said she is just concerned and has a right to ask i also have been struggling to find a job because no one around me is hiring right now this is one thing that has been weighing on me when my mom got mad she said the reason no one wants to hire me is because i just look miserable and depressed this really hurt i really dont mean to upset her i just honestly have no answer to that question today having someone just constantly tell me i look miserable depressed and sad and asking whats wrong with me doesnt feel good i have no idea how to answer that question when nothing bad happened sorry if this post is kinda ranty does anyone have a good way to handle this question,post-pandemic,0.08856211,0.19583665,0.49856848,0.8084391,0.46735713,0.89360034,0.14106414,0.4395825

i recently had an awakening and i realized that i have self sabotaged myself my whole life girls and people in general but mostly girls not giving me all their attention automatically meant i was worthless and every time i passed a girl on the street that didnt look my way it further reiterated and crystallized that concept into my head when im talking to a girl and something as small as her not texting back instantly happens it automatically means im worthless i never voice these feelings and i end up walking away but i always paint them as the villain i blame them and i genuinely suffer from pain but i make it all up all my heart breaks every single one was caused by me walking away and shutting them out and blaming them in my head they rejected me they betrayed me and i believe it but now i see its all fake but it felt so real how could the suffering i went thru for 5 years be fake how can this be fixed how do i stop how do i stop being an overly sensitive over reactive little b,post-pandemic,0.298991,0.11324596,0.6962051,0.920006,0.8008346,0.91983026,0.1501186,0.7293992

so im a guy 27 since couple o days i have been diagnosed with depression and anxiety at the age of 10 since then i tried i tried really hard did everything i was told and far beyond i can confidently confirm that nothing works and the harder i try the more i realized people around me despite caring maybe unknowingly but are all liars it doesnt ever get better you can suspend it but then you have it breathing on back of your neck all the time due to my mental state ive lost 23 jobs last year im now 3 months unemployed with debt on both of my accounts running on previously stacked potatos rice and ramen tap water is fine too if you boil it is that how homeless people are created cause im pretty sure im on a right path ive been happily engaged for 7 years and im in open relationship since january and i love them both and they do too its justa lot of weight on my shoulders cause if i die im not hurting one person im hurting two and i know both will follow me soon after so im kinda a hostage in my own little paradise funny to admit in such place that selfharm actually did help in a sad wicked way but they asked me to stop and i stopped looong ago problem is nothing brings relief such as this did right now i got another self destructive behavior that helps but i just feel i wont be able to run like that for much longer im abusing alcohol and weed since i stopped doing bad things to myself weirdly enough my problems feel like they exist only when im sober like i know its barely an escape let alone a good one but can we stop for a moment and just admit even if it works just for an hour or two still works better than doing nothing why not therapy again well i suppose much changed over those almost 20 years since the last time but i hold a heavy distrust and fear towards professional help first of all free one sucks paid one is designed to never truly help so you come back and leave more funds in the checkout second in my current state i without any psych education can assure you im fit for a temporary lockup thing is lock me up there and ill find a way to off myself there this is the highest risk place in my case once i go to hospital its game over for me i wont be able to handle the shame i cant survive couple a days without my loved ones near let alone month or longer at this point the only thing that is keeping me sane and alive are those two people and i know how saddening it may sound but they might not be enough to help i want to cry i want to leave without word of warning just disappear so i dont hurt em in the end they mean everything to me but lately life means nothing and i was ready to end it looooong time ago i absolutely have no idea what to do next other than yknow click clack bang please give me just a tiny bit of hope at least im going mad,post-pandemic,0.17310633,0.14583646,0.31343725,0.90852565,0.29169354,0.8973562,0.18324696,0.5781182

ive been on reddit for well over a decade but never posted or commented on anything apart from a song i uploaded on another now inactive account ive got to the point where i feel i need to reach out because there must be some one else who is going through a similar thing and im getting tired of feeling alone in this it seems impossible to control my emotions and i seem to get physiologically depressed at least once a month which leaves me feeling incredibly physically empty in my chest ill go through a period of being at the top of my game and feeling like a normal person for a few days and then that disappears and for most of the time i feel hollow and drinking seems to be the only fix i know its not good and im fully aware that when i dont drink im more balanced overall its hard to explain how much i feel it helps when there is a proper void in my chest and nothing else will fill it some counsellors get it and some dont ive also recently realised i have a lot of anger in me that i never got help with when i was a child my family dealt with tension by screaming and breaking shit and it felt like it was a daily occurrence i think this is still a huge part of me and its given me a real authority complex where im just always waiting for people i perceive as having more power than me to snap and destroy me it sounds dramatic but thats what it feels like im also admittedly quite sensitive but i have a hard time empathising with people unless they are obviously suffering i hate injustice and inequality and this occupies a lot of my day to day thoughts but i struggle to connect with people on a casual basis im a bit of an outsider but no one would see any of these things day to day i just keep ending up in this same position where i feel that everything is too much and i just want to escape sometimes this manifests as suicide attempts and ive often cut myself as a way of relieving the tension in me because i dont want to damage other things i thought it would get better when i got older but now im approaching my mid 30s and nothing has changed i feel like a nuisance and a burden to everyone and its often hard to justify my existence i have such low self esteem in the times where i feel low i also feel guilty because i dont think i would actually kill myself but sometimes it seems like the only way out and it distresses everyone around me i feel so trapped so much of the time and its more or less a weekly fight to right myself and assure myself that i shouldnt quit my job and just live on the streets because things would be so much more simple im confused and i dont have a lot of hope for the future im not particularly depressed right now but these thoughts dont seem to be exclusive to my deep depressive episodes its a constant undercurrent and a general dissatisfaction either with life existentially or with the expectations of 21st century life or both i often shun advice even though i know it will help im often just too tired i dont know what gives other people the drive to do what they do every day the monotonyof life has always seemed so pointless to me the only thing that seems to lift me up is being high on something and that was the cure i didnt try anything until i was 18 and it took a while for alcohol to become medication i was already dealing with this for years before i started with drugs i dont have any physiological addictions but i do drink too much im able to monitor it well and ive never had withdrawals but i am definitely an alcoholic in the last few years its become harder and harder to push through these feelings because it seems like ill be stuck with this for the rest of my life and now each time i have these thoughts i think about how once i get past it ill just end up in the same place again in a few weeks i dont know what to expect from this but i guess im looking forward to hearing other peoples experiences thanks,post-pandemic,0.10326406,0.17399801,0.8145971,0.75832254,0.91666466,0.81975657,0.093633115,0.4134461

depression doesnt end did you realise how bad the society treatsconcentrates on suicidal or mind broken people we always see in documentaries like this guy has this disease or this guy is gay and you should respect him but nothing about mind broken depressed people i am not saying we are in a higher position or should get treated better i am saying we should be at an equal position then they would probably use like they die or something like that as an excuse but most of us die to doing suicide not accepting this horrible fate and they mostly dont listen i heard so many people make jokes like ughh why would you do suicide they should be asking why not the reason we die is not us it is them and they dont care did you ever see one post saying that his psychiatrist cured his depression no you probably didnt they earn money by doing pretty much nothing and think they are doing hard work the little population that comes out of this horrible fate does it them selfs in a long process losing friends and maybe even family to clarify how hard it is to get out of depression let me tell people who dont have depression what is going on in this broken mind as we turn depressed we start seeing the world in its true colors the bad society people life itself everything is pain you start thinking philosophically and that is good that is the true nature of humans thinking philosophically not painted in the paint of society or medics the reason it is good and we are still depressed is that society doesnt think this is right and tries to paint is in that colorless color of it if everyon ewoild have this kind of mindset we wouldnt be depressed working towards equality of eveyone not just visible things that we think have to be fixed so we can see no differentiation between them and us we are also depressed cause so many people say depression should be cured but still make fun of people that have when i was a kid we had a really nostalgic guy that had suicidal thoughts and there were girls and boys everywhere making jokes about him i wanted to do something but what could i do i would get outcasted myself he started thinking a little bit more philosophically after that too the more we get depressed the more philosophically we think and that makes us realise how bad humanity is and the more depressed we get if you think you have depression because you are sad you arent you are just sad and nothing like us the longer you have depression the harder it is to get out and at one time almost impossible the thing you get depression from is the thing you concentrate most on with philosophy but everthing comes to humanity at the end it is all our fault making everthing like this painting our own colors to grey so people dont ask i have depression since i am 9 because of prejudice of my looks and thinking and many more things i wont tell how old i am i hope you understand i wish you keep on thinking philosophically or start thinking like that and i wish you a wonderful daynightnoonmorningevening,post-pandemic,0.45442185,0.15219992,0.06403094,0.6461052,0.058660723,0.7461868,0.2725819,0.36458924

venting out i 28f come from a nuclear family and my dad had been on work trips for most parts so i was raised majorly by my mom and i have no siblings my dad was one of the best people on earth and i lost him a few months ago my mom on the other hand is a good person but she was extremely verbally abusive towards everyone in the family and physically abusive to us and her parents so i always hated her growing up i saw my dad getting abused by her my whole life and never knew what i could do to help him so i ended up crying all the time but both of them loved me to death we have moved a lot geographically so i was never able to have stable group of friends finally i went to an all girls college and everyone hated me there as i was this extremely spoiled daddys princess who knew nothing in real world and i used to cry in my room all the time so my life was still pretty fucked up the only escape i ever had was jumping from one relationship to another i have been doing that since i was 14 so i continued doing that i threw all my anger at my boyfriends and then would change my relationship when things would get bad anyhow my college got over and i got a job and have been working since this is the only good thing i have i am financially independent i got into this relationship over 2 years ago and things were wonderful in the beginning except i messed things up by throwing my anger at him but he never left me and i thought hey now that all my anger is gone i can finally begin to be a healthy relationship but god had other plans he has started to take revenge and he insults me hurts me blames every chance he gets and i have lost every ounce of self respect i ever had he is a good guy and had made significant sacrifices to be with me does not have bad habits nothing questionable so i feel that if i let him go i wouldnt ever get a good guy so i digest all the hatred with a pinch of salt i do this because i think its my karma coming back and this is what i deserve i have lost my dad a few months ago then i had a surgery which has an extremely long recovery and one of my closest friends got married and rest of them are all married engaged pregnantmaking alot of money i am living with my family due to recovery and they love me but i think they dont like me as a person and that is true for everyone else in my life too i do not have friends to reach out to therapy is too expensive my boyfriend hates me cant share all this with my family as my mom is also processing grief overall i am completely alone and super lonely another thing to know about me is i am an extremely logical person thrive for perfection in every aspect of my life and generally dont give importance to emotions and now i am overwhelmed to point where i dont know what to do i know for a fact that this relationship is doomed to fail and i am not cut out to be a wifemother i lack empathy and emotional understanding plus i have too much baggage i had hobbies when i was a child but since we moved so much geographically i got out of touch and now i have no hobby my mom also made sure to feed me for my entire life that my friends are bad my relatives are bad everyone is out there to hurt me so as an adult i never know how to sustain any friendship and i also have no contact with my relatives because i wasnt allowed to for about 25 years i am a complete loner and all i want is to stay on my bed and use my phone which is really depressing but thats what i like however i do make a effort to do a few things during the day as a result of all of the above i feel like i am going to die alone,post-pandemic,0.29104602,0.080522366,0.20292403,0.64180475,0.37914628,0.8729982,0.10243601,0.2456095

throwaway account naturally lol partially just wanna vent cause i have no one to do that with so im relying on internet strangers and perhaps just at my wits end on what to do im 17m finals in 3 months and studying to be a doctor but i feel very empty and alone not diagnosed with depression and dont know if i have it but i dont know how to describe this feeling firstly i just feel terrible about feeling this way since i live a very privileged life and have been able to go private school my whole life not to say my rough hasnt had rough patches ive been bullied for being fat and appearances out of my control my older brother has a learning disability my dad also got into trouble with loan sharks when i was around grade 3 so my parents had to always work and were rarely home worry about my safety and never really being able to make friends outside of school since i was always at home with my grandparents because of this i always feel like im behind having to sacrifice everything to work hard and catch up for things i could never develop naturally through experiences like talking in my mother tongue and understanding my own culture i cant go to anyone either my parents always argued when i was a kid both about finances and my brother so i always had to act as the mediator while its better now they still argue and blame each other if i confront them about problems and convey any sembelance of struggle its always matched with i have to work as well even though i feel ive spent so much of my life and decisions for the sake of them i disappeared last summer for an evening just contemplating suicide and i got joking remarks about how suicide and cutting are serious issues for teenagers nowadays they also have more financial freedom and time now after spending so much of their time and energy just so my brother and i could continue attending private and seeing how stressed they were before i feel like all my problems are my own to bear which im trying my damn best to but now i genuinely dont know how to cope with this feeling of complete emptiness and weight in my chest its not like i dont have friends i have my close group of friends and have a decent amount of acquaintances just from all the projects and activities i partake it ive helped a lot of them with their struggles but part of me just doesnt feel like i can depend on them they just feel like mates but not people who could give genuine insight on how i feel and ive tried all the coping mechanisms i was fat so i started playing sports cut my calories to 1800 a day and got abs and now go to the gym and do cardio 4x a week ive selftaught 2 instruments starting from old rusty few decade old handmedowns because my parents could never afford lessons and got involved in productions and activities i worked hard at academics because i was always the dumb kid and bottom of the class in tests and grades and now climbed my way to trying to become a doctor i had cystic acne and tried every treatment now on accutane for a few months and its getting better despite the scars from 4 years of severe acne i volunteer and try my best to help people and repay people and be grateful so why do i feel so empty i feel like ive done so much in this short time frame and all the things people say will help im only limited by things i cant control such as genetics and time despite this in the past 25 years ive had bouts of suicide but was always too scared but in the past 2 years theyve been coming back more frequent and more vivid and more appealing and that scares me i had my fourth genuine episode recently how do i cope with this emptiness loneliness and just absolute lack of selfworth its starting to impede my studies and social life i either cant focus or the relief is temporary from any of the activities i do above ive both not pursued girls who showed interest in me and rejected a girl because i was too busy and also scared theyd be disappointed in who i really was vs who they thought i was and how terrible of a boyfriend id be i started cutting myself recently because i couldnt focus in class and was shaking even though i never had thoughts about it before i dont want to turn to alcohol or drugs cause i know how devastating it can be on my life i think i do everything for myself and all my goals are genuine so why do i still feel like this and do all these things if you made it to the end genuinely thank you for reading it all for the record i dont want any sympathy of pity as harsh as that sounds id appreciate if you could give honest input even if its harsh or just something healthy i could try to get rid of this burden,post-pandemic,0.16341887,0.14591873,0.84835523,0.8462985,0.9430148,0.86567795,0.11991713,0.5598777

i became disabled about two and half to three years ago ive pretty much always lived in poverty and thats what its gotten me i got with a girl when i was in my early 20s and got her pregnant i tried my best with things i rushed to buy a house that i really couldnt afford for her and that was a huge mistake not only did she end up just disappearing forever and leaving me with the kid and the house but the house she wanted ended up being a disaster it had many problems but the worst one has been the new roof which was installed incorrectly ive been here 12 years now and its leaked for most of those years despite multiple attempts to have it fixed a few years ago i thought i finally had the problem solved some guys came out and repaired it and all was good six months or so passed and it wasnt leaking anymore so i dumped a huge amount of money into remodeling the room the leak had been in since i had just graduated college and gotten a shiny new job big mistake again shortly after i finished the remodel the leak came back same place it was before nobody i called could take responsibility and wed been having some heavy rains i was scared of all the money and work i put into it being literally washed away so i stupidly climbed on the roof with a tarp and thought id just lay some plastic down over it and hopefully at least prevent further damage until i could afford to have someone come back again to fix it again i fell rolled down the roof and off the side of the house and ruined my life forever i destroyed my back and have nerve damage in my shoulder i guess im lucky i survived or at least thats what people tell me i can barely walk unassisted i have trouble lifting my right arm and im in constant pain obviously i havent been able to work since then i tried for a while but the pain was too much the lack of mobility made everything so much harder and my hand shakes too much to do the intricate electronics work that i went to college for so two years ago i applied for social security disability and i was denied i appealed and was denied again i requested a judge look at my case last september and two days ago she denied my appeal as well in spite of her own vocational specialist testifying during the hearing that i couldnt work based on my condition in these past two years with no income i lost my car that i stupidly bought when i got the shiny new job and ive sold almost all of my possessions just to keep the lights on i havent paid my mortgage in well over a year because i just have not had the income and as a result im in foreclosure on this shitty home thats been the source of all my pain and suffering you would think i wouldnt be too heartbroken about losing the house considering all the issues that have come of it but its still my home i bled for this home i ruined my life for this home its the only home my now 13 yo son has ever known and on the 27th of february its being auctioned off and ill lose the last material possession i have i dont really know where were going to go from here my parents would take us in and thats good for my son but my parents are controlling overbearing spiteful and i think i hate them im 34 years old and they still try to micromanage my life even though i havent lived with them in 12 years i dont know if ill survive living under their roof again all i do know is that ive lost almost everything im miserable and i hate my life i hate the world and ive become so angry and bitter over my situation that ive even begun hating everyone around me im even beginning to resent my son because deep down he just reminds me of that one stupid mistake i made almost 14 years ago that lead me to all of this and because despite that i still feel the responsibility of a parent towards him hes the only reason im still alive honestly i would have killed myself by now if it wasnt for the guilt and fear of what that would do to him im just stuck in this miserable existence where my life is devoid of all happiness and every waking moment is filled with pain both physical and emotional and im tired so very tired i wish it would end,post-pandemic,0.26183328,0.07956091,0.35573858,0.8583414,0.572368,0.88845396,0.11743724,0.5305885
attempting for a perfect moment and everything good in my life to be perfectly independent is driving me insane help idk what to do now my percectionism is opposite of most i have to be perfectly loserlike and alone and independent so when i do have a moment it is purely mine which is easy afffff when youre alone but driving me insane right now because im forced to be home since im a high schooler fuck idk plus i have to reset my school account and have a new toothbrush and school is getting remodeled and im ocd about these things happening and they have to happen now but i dont want imperfection of them however now due to missing the bus today and being driven they are imperfect and ughhhhh idk what to do like literally what do i do with myself do i give up on saving my first drink for a perfect moment and waste that on now idk what should i do give up and be in room forever what do i do bro idek if this is ocd since its only about one fucking thing but it has dragged on for like years and this specific version for months i havent showered for months or brushed teeth in months due to this one thing i cant stand the idea of my parents helping or contributing anything to me like its an extreme form of this ocd maybe idk but anyways theres this moment that ive been building up to for years life changing turn around and i had it i ran away because i lied about being with others to georgia and it was this whole thing i spent days on this and it was perfect i was like okay november first i go to gym daily never stop and do computer work and eat healthy and im no longer the same person and i can become sensitive now because im a new person and blah blah then 31st october i was taken home worrrrst thing ever like because i became sensitive and then it was the most painful car ride i mean i was seriously tweaking but anyways bro months and months of like trying to get a perfect moment again but not about improvement but just about accepting what happened and leaving this stupid in between state its been like 4 fucking months and every time something happens ive been taking it more extreme recently and havent showered or brushed because like oh my mom and dad interrupted me last time and i was trying to like erase that and act as tho it never happened so i wash hands for hours but idk anywyas today was the day i wore the perfect underwear perfect shirt perfect shorts that i was so fucking cautious to wear because i couldnt wear it on an imperfect day and imperfect is pretty much just a day that my parents have any influence over because i cant let my moment and shit have influence from them and it was perrrrrfeft i set alarm like 5 times to get the perfect wake up and set up my room perfectly the bottles on the floor the clothes and blanket everything perrrfect spent the whole week well really 3 months but my mom changed it a little prolly cause it doesnt seem important to me but it is a week ago so i spent the week on it too and ugh today things were sooooo perfect and loserlike and perfect that i missed the bus i went to the other stop but i went there for the first time the day after she did my laundry and kicked the bottles of water and i stayed up all night cause of that but anyways because of that if i went i wouldnt think hmm this is new which in turn is allowing my mom doing my laundry of the 3 shirts and 2 shorts i wore which were like perfect i wore on hood bad days and accumulated good germs on one and just omg it was so perfect and set up like seriously i have been planning that this week be the week like over weekend then monday and bam no longer ocd and shi cause like i have to time it with parents houses so like i have to plan 3 weeks ahead minimum for real but anyways i saw some other kid with a backpack and i was like ill follow him as to not allow mom doing my laundry that day affect me on my perfect day fucking bitch was a random dude smoking at 6am with a backpack and like 5 small animals around him not even a student i ran back to cut losses and make the other one but i missed that too called all my like 4 friendspeople i know with cars and ugh no one could drive me and i was literally like hyperventilating on the sidewalk or something and then my mom was texting tell me if you need me to pick you up and blah blah school is useless all my classes are either study hall or basic ass classes that lower my gpa for being standard classes and you just sleep in anyways cause its practically study hall too the only reason i go is because i have to for my perfect moment thats the only reason im not depressed its not even a perfect moment its just accepting how much of a loser i am moment not even life changing bs but i cant function in a positive way until i have it and now it will be a month maybe more because if they sign me up for therapy thats another bad week and weeks come in pairs so its another badimperfect 2 weeks my mom pulled over by me since she has my location and made me to get in her car after already ruining my perfect text conversation noise and soundnoise i hear from her tv and indirect sound which i spent hours exhaustingly making sure was perfect and loserlike and perfectly okay last night same with dad too but i dont see him today so its fine i hate them and i hate doing this ocd last words bullshit but i have to because last words before my loser moment is so important but she drove me and we were both like arguing and crying and it ruined my outfits perfect germs and energy and memory and ruined the day and therefor the weekends and therefor next week and possibly therefor my life idk and i only have like 4 outfits and this was the only grey and black perfect one and now that its ruined i dont have a perfect outfit and idek what to do because i cant have a perfect moment anymore why am i even in school today or for all of the past week if my moment was ruined like it was all and is currently all for nothing now i dont know how to deal with this it will now be like 3 more weeks without brushing and thats dangerous but i cant allow my first brush on the new toothbrush to be on a day my mom drove me to school or the week after that what the fuck am i doing now but also i dont even know if i want an answer because then its allowing something good to come from something good my mom did which i cant stand

ive been getting mental health support some of it has cause more harm than helped since before i can remember the reason for this is because i was a problem child undiagnosed autism and adhd for most of my childhood my dad would abuse me my sibling and my mom mostly verbally and emotionally with threats of violence and throwing things but he never really hit me or anyone else as far as i can remember and hes chill now but i dont really care at this point as i am kind of estranged from my family we never speak but its not like an official thing because of this i dont feel connected to my family and i also struggle to connect with others as well in life i have mostly related with depressive types who end up killings themselves the main abusive thing my father would do is threaten suicide whenever any of us would act out of line basically read his mind when hes in a bad mood and i think my way of coping with this is viewing it as an acceptable path for me too ive always wanted to leave because staying here is too unbearable im not really able to lead the kind of life i want to live due to factors outside of my control and i lack the intrinsic drive to make a facsimile happen i dont seem to get the positive rewards other people get from socializing or really any form of positive reinforcement at all no matter what happens in my life i still feel down i have a partner friends social network hobbies people compliment me in publici get attention this used to be a reason for me feeling bad like lack of attention so i thought fixing it would help me i dont have much financial troubles at least super serious ones i live a pretty stress free life but the only time i am at peace is when i am distracted or alone with low stimulation and not thinking about my current situation or future or past ive tried a lot of different treatments for depression in my life and nothing seems to help im also pretty healthy at the time of writing and have pretty much every biological marker taken care of like hormone or vitamin related is there a hail mary treatment out there for people who are really treatment resistant am i just going to be like this until i die,post-pandemic,0.37652534,0.13379511,0.122660235,0.6085164,0.23026553,0.747617,0.08052826,0.21294117

i know i cant take matters into my own hands because my dad mom and grandma would quickly follow so thats basically murder at that point then my friends who are mainly all longdistance at this point gasoline for the fire of my depression would blame themselves and be stuck with that trauma forever thats a life sentence of misery for people who love me in a healthier and more supportive way than my own parents do my boyfriend would also blame himself he hasnt been making much time for me whatsoever at all though so he is certainly not helping he doesnt know at all how bad my mental health is to be fair but man if i got terminal cancer thats nobodys fault everyone would grieve maybe in some capacity forever but they could only be angry at the chaos of the universe not themselves i know its sick to want that when countless families are tormented by it daily but if there was a way to give my health to someone who was terminally ill and take their sickness and die from it i wouldnt think twice im around 80k in debt all in collections because i was financially abused by my ex i have a boyfriend i adore but have only been seeing a few times a month he says it will get better when he gets a house and settles into his new job and doesnt have his family ordering him around but im running out of strength to withstand it my mom is extremely abusive because of her npd and always has been and thats confusing as hell because she loves me so much but its also as easy as breathing for her to be horrifically cruel to me her emotions dictate my entire life right now my dad is depressed and unable to leave his abusive girlfriend who hates my guts hes also in financial hardship im also fucking autistic and i spent the past two years caretaking for my cruel and psychotic morbidly obese aunt who hallucinated and shat herself in our shared bathroom just for my mom to kick her out a few months ago all i have going for me is my looks even my intelligence hasnt been of much use to me because my autism makes me nave and people just use me then my looks make people want to use me more i cant even count how many rapeattempts ive narrowly escaped my biggest fear is that next time i wont get away id rather just be killed one of my main ways to deal with the emotional pain is to go online and genuinely compliment people usually other women otherwise i will starve myself pull out my hair bash my head against the wall or furiously smack myself classic autistic meltdown style as a consequence of the first coping mechanism i now have a decent collection of online mutuals who adore me and check up on me daily i feel like i do things that make it impossible for me to off myself but i still fantasize about it constantly its madness i hate how most of my love is online i havent hugged my best friend in korea since the night before she left in august then i cried so hard i almost threw up on the train because she was the one friend in my city i saw regularly modern life is so fucking sad and im financially ruined so i cant even afford a few hundred dollars to go stay with my best friend in vancouver for a few days she tried to come here but i couldnt even get two days off work i try i try so hard to live a normal healthy life and i grasp and grasp and it all just turns to shit in my hands i know that subconsciously my bf sees me as a burden because i dont have friends i go out with after work like a normal 20something he doesnt care about the money thing but i know him being my main social life bothers him im friends with my colleagues but two of them have kids and the other one is like 21 and im 28 i see people going out in groups and doing things offline together and i feel so embarrassed and weird i have a lot of friends ive worked really hard on building those relationships but they are in vancouver and miami and incheon korea and goddamn sydney australia my daytoday is mainly walking on eggshells around my mom and even if i do everything right if shes due for a blowup she will blow up at me and it could happen at any time im going insane my heart starts racing when i hear her footsteps coming up the stairs and im fucking 28 its just like when i was a child again and the finances are keeping me trapped and she keeps asking for more money and i do owe her its hell im already in hell,post-pandemic,0.62503576,0.15239489,0.13482878,0.8723545,0.117232084,0.86244446,0.31926692,0.6000202

hey reddit i 30f wanted to share a story about my tumultuous journey through the suffocating darkness of depression and the unexpected beacon of light that appeared in the form of a friend named owen a few years ago i found myself submerged in a sea of relentless despair life had lost its vibrancy and each day felt like a relentless struggle against an invisible force pulling me deeper into an abyss of hopelessness one evening standing on the edge of a precipice i contemplated the void below the allure of oblivion seemed irresistible a seductive escape from the persistent pain in that desperate moment my friend owen sensing my struggle reached out owen had noticed the subtle changes in my demeanor the quiet cries for help masked by a faade of normalcy he refused to stand idly by and instead of judging or withdrawing he offered a lifeline in that crucial moment his unwavering support became a glimmer of hope in my darkest hour with owen by my side i sought therapy the first step in a long and arduous journey toward healing he became my confidant listening without judgment as i unraveled the tangled mess inside my mind his presence turned therapy into a shared experience a collaborative effort to navigate the labyrinth of my thoughts loneliness which had been my closest companion began to recede owen stayed by my side dispelling the isolation that had threatened to consume me his understanding and compassion bridged the gap between my internal struggles and the external world reminding me that i was not alone selfcare once an alien concept took on a new meaning with owens encouragement he gently nudged me toward small achievable steps helping me rediscover the joy in simple pleasures that depression had stolen from me the journey was far from linear filled with false dawns and crushing setbacks owens steadfast friendship served as a beacon guiding me through the treacherous terrain together we faced the challenges celebrated small victories and weathered the storms of relapse if you find yourself entangled in the same shadows remember that reaching out for help can make a world of difference owen showed me that true friendship is not just about shared laughter but also about standing together in the darkest corners the journey may be difficult but sometimes in the company of a friend we discover an unexpected strength that paves the way from darkness to dawn,post-pandemic,0.04832871,0.10779395,0.3413234,0.519239,0.6434311,0.76204205,0.115031354,0.16445376

i realized recently that the only people that talk to me are the ones that i talk to i stopped talking to some of my friends first recently and i stopped seeing them entirely unless i bump into them in public i introduced my entire friend group with the exclusion of 2 or 3 who knows each other before but out of almost 10 people i am the reason they know each other and now that they do they talk without me they each have their own smaller groupchats that exclude me and have smaller sets of the group they frequently make plans that dont involve me unless i ask them to be somewhere i recently tried to express this to them because i dont think that moping around until they notice will make me feel any better but when i told them how they felt they didnt seem to care with all of the empty promises and excuses they didnt even notice that it had been that long they would have invited me but this or that well make an effort to make sure you dont feel left out im just sick of it why am i the one who has to make all of the effort why am i the one who has to care about the friendship why am i the one who has to start all over because theyre done with me why am i so goddamn worthless i tried to be more positive for a bit i tried to be less negative all of the time i tried to be more proactive in my friendships and all of the sudden when im not a risk of being miserable they fucking leave me behind like i never mattered in the first place why dont i fucking matter why do i have to be the one who has to fucking beg and beg and beg for them to be my friends when not that long ago we actually were friends i feel like some dumb fucking abused animal that cant get it through their skull that the person whos abandoned them doesnt fucking love them i just want it all to be over i dont want new friends i dont want this to happen over and over and over again i just want the noise to stop i want someone to look me in the eye and be happy that im in the room i just want my friends to be my friends,post-pandemic,0.13561082,0.15579131,0.5746284,0.51245004,0.82853854,0.6959165,0.073981464,0.20274276

i dont really have a point to this reddit other then the fact that i need to vent and treating this like a journal entry but breaking the third wall by having people read it and maybe respond and or relate bare with me it takes me a long time to write my thoughts out and if i reread or look at something for too long i start to second guess want to add or reword the perfectionist in me takes a life time to fucking do shit so imma just type it in one go and hope i makes sense my punctuation will be absolutely abysmal my vents are word vomit and i dont got time for grammar check lmaooo i also tend to wonder and have side tangent thoughts and internal monologue that spits out when i write or try to speak my mind basically it just feels like ive had to continuously come to terms with the fact that i may possibly be suicidal depressed forever and i dont say that to feed the narrative of like i dont think it will get better this is coming from a place of ive experienced bliss harmony peace unity and genuine joy to breath to live once in my entire life and i mean this so genuinely and it lasted for about 8months a year i know this because well i lived it and i have an annoyingly hyper vigilant mind adhd with anxiety along with depression and i over analyze every moment and whos ruminating thoughts is constantly self aware of the emotions that arrive in my body and also i have been journaling since 7 and i have always had suicidal ideation i thought more about ways to die then what i would do with my life i contribute it to just seeing everything for what it is and yes that means even the beautiful i have always been a sensitive person i felt everything especially the negative emotions tantrum kid guilty and its not like i dont try i have healed a lot of things a lot of time and life is always about continues healing but like i feel like thats a practical joke that the universe is playing on us like not only did i not get to decide if i wanted to be a dog or a goat or a dolphin like a human like the species that has to do the absolute fucking most to just function well and not die fromdeseases like humans are just weak as fuck as a species like ur telling me my own body can take me out if i cut myself and get an infection ur telling me i have to cleanse myself or i will stinkkkkk and fungus with start attacking my body and all my teeth will decay if i dont brush my damn teeth when was the last time a dolphin had to bath do laundry had to take a test and go to school and straight from one prison to the next one called work where u will sell ur mind and body and time to pay to live where every other species gets to live on the same planet humans do rent free like dead ass i wake up roll my eyes and sigh like shit another day of playing this game called life on earth its like jumanji except u cant beat the game and send all the bad things away and return to normal the bad things are there forever and more keep coming and dont get me wrong the earth is beautiful like traveling and hiking is some of my favorite things to do i dont think this world lacks in ways to be enjoyed ex i love roads trips camping zip lining etc raving more then anything im a musician i have hobbies and sports like i have tried to lead a life i would i should care for or be at least semi content with but i cant everything that is negative about my existence overshadows and out ways what ever temporary bits of bliss i obtained but also i just genuinely feel being born america let alone in new york city your already what so many people would consider a dream of a place to be in with so many opportunities like ur entire future is being though up of before ur even born gratitude is something im very present of and have to remind myself regularly but why is it that i have to remind myself constantly of what its like to feel happy yet constantly feel sadness despair hopeless ness and rage there are only so many ways u can go in life when you feel like this either find a way to force urself essentially to find ways to feel baseline but finding something that can even surpass baseline doesnt come ever so often but drugs is definitely one of them i genuinely could have been a drug addict well i have dealt with some battles in that area as well but have consistently fight for my sobriety i smoke weed but am trying the work on minimizing or quitting all together but smokeing for 15 years with the exception of times ive taken breaks some short some up to 68 month but for the same reason i dont submit to my addictive tendencies and succumb to continues substance use and taking my life away slowly or even dieing from accidental overdose is the same reason i havent attempted suicide i wouldnt want to put that on my little sister my mother family and friends and yes its in those moments u care more about the emotional damage u will cause others but not even drugs could get me to wanna be alive epically when high without a single worry athough in an ideal world if i could do acid everyday without it having any negative or long term side effects i sure fucking would that being said i have great people around me and although depression is a lonely feeling i know of so many people dealing with it in their own way and have been open about my good and bad with friends and family i saw a post that a friend sent me and the caption read this caption heres why you procrastinate the things youre supposed to care about procrastinating is not the avoidance of a task its the avoidance of pain triggered by a task if you do not find a way to minimize the pain you will keep avoiding it and my response although i did not send it was what if the pain is simply that u dont care if u succeed or fail because u dont care to live or at least live in the continues state of misery the kind that has only been lifted by very few things in life but that just serves as temporary distraction even if its something you love doing but only for the time being the procrastination isnt just about avoidable pain its putting off disappointment but also the fear of trying to define and persue what you think u desire just to realize that you still continue to feel the same its like every happy moment has underlining sadness and even if i get what i think i want or live authentically trying to find peace before i know it i realize there is nothing i can achieve that will make me care to live and thats suicidal ideation in a nut shell i rather know that i am going to die in the next few days then to know weather i continuously live in misery or force myself to pretend i dont we all just want to die a little right that is the lens ive lived with most if not all of my life but trust me when i say i still choose to keep going ive never brought myself to attempt taking my own life only have thoughts of all the ways i could ive list all the whys and why nots and also play out the scenarios as we all have done about the after math or even questioning and wanting to understand your beliefs faiths religion etc thats a whole other subreddit tho my point is sometimes we just want to know if taking our own lives would really result in going to hell or will it actually release us from the pain and also allow our soul to heal in the spirit realm the thing is all i know is that i know nothing socrates i would like to hope its not hell but i would also already be going there because im a lesbian or so some regions catholic is how i was raised believe but meee not so much and before anyone comments go to therapy or take an ssri or other medication and adhd meds ive been in and out of therapy since i was 7 and took adhd meds for 11 years and then stopped for 6 and am trying again ive also taken a pleathera of different medications for anxiety as well have tried anti depressants which doesnt give u a reason to live its just another bandaid i feel like an absolute fraud like let me pretend to give a fuck

24 years old no love life whatsoever kissless virgin socially inept insecure suicidal on and off but i was working hard on myself and felt i had made tremendous improvements over the past few months and believed i was on the road to recovery by myself thought i was finally in a good spot met this girl off tinder well call her jenny for privacy sake have been on plenty of tinder dates in the past so wasnt expecting much i have never clicked with a girl like i did this one down to earth funny unique flirty cute checked boxes i didnt even know i had i struggled the entire date with being awkward and nervous and she was still so cool about it towards the end when i was sure she was going to leave and ghost me she said she was still waiting for a kiss i was on cloud 9 after the date then the insecurities and mental illness i thought i was working past returned in overdrive over the next few days i made stuff up lied trying to figure some stuff out for insecurities gas lit her was an absolute horrible human being lied some more and chased her away assumed she was talking to other dudes which even if she was it would have been none of my business thought the energy between us changed after the date even though texting habits never changed and we were still talking got immediately unhealthily attached and ruined everything caused by my own insecure insanity and actions all of that work i thought i did to help myself was a ruse this gave me the rude awakening that i was never okay and that i needed help i was in the best mental spot id been at in years and a single date with a one of a kind girl that i single handedly ruined afterwards due to my own undiscovered traumas was enough to bring me from the top of the mountain i recently climbed back down to near suicide at the drop of a dime it gave me the insight and fortitude to reach out to ones i thought no longer loved me for help and with their support and professional help i am doing what i once thought was impossible and could never do it is getting better the feeling this girl gave me regardless of how my mental illnesses ruined it afterwards inspired me that there is hope there are things worth living for but you just might not be in the right state to find them it is extremely pathetic to let something so small such a short relationship with someone i barely knew impact me so heavily but i will use this experience to learn from my mistakes and make my life worth living thank you jenny,post-pandemic,0.10648575,0.1097896,0.39441755,0.43289715,0.7794706,0.70905477,0.0927094,0.162269

it would be nice to have the unconditional kind of love and care you offer to others but we all know that life will never work that way reality sucks we all know better to expect any one person or any group of people to be there for you when you really need itonly works for a short period of time they will only offer help temporarily but they also all have their own lives to work om and deal with so in the end youre expected to just get over it or to find help elsewhere never expect someone to be there for you expectations create hope and unanswered hope always means pain and suffering and being alone again when no one bothers to show up for you like you would for them its a strange thing when society tells you to reach outyet reaching out and becoming a burden to others is part of the problem reaching out causes dependence which only leads to disappointment i dont want to disrupt other peoples lives by reaching out and becoming even more of a burden i want everyone to go on with their happy lives i wish i could just crawl into a hole somewhere and sleep forever and for everyone to forget about me it would be better this way for everyone i feel so incredibly exhausted i just want to sleep there was a time earlier last year when i had made all the plans to distance myself from everyone and unalive my existence i was told by people around me at the time that i seemed the most happiest and relaxed ive ever beenbut plans fell through i missed my timing and now i feel stuck there is so much pain and anger inside me i recently had an outburst of this anger but was told to apologise for acting out on my feelings my feelings never matter how i feel will never be a priority it hurt a lot to realise that neither family or people who i though were my friends but only ever used me for their convenience ever considered how hurt i feel i turn 30 this year 30 years of being worthless i had hoped that i wouldnt be exisiting to this age i almost died a few years ago unintentionally it was the most peaceful feeling ive ever had tooi crave that feeling if i cant unalive myself the best way is to disassociate and become numb to everything to isolate myself from the world people rarely give a thought about me anyways im tired of reaching out only to have silence as my response heres to hoping i can quietly isolate myself forever for the good of society and for the happiness and lives of everyone around me,post-pandemic,0.15434209,0.0810497,0.63336074,0.7174263,0.89748275,0.8342159,0.10956272,0.41796795

hi rdepression my 39f spouse has battled depression for most of her life and it has slowly gotten worse over time shes been in weekly therapy her entire life and has been seeing a therapist that she likes and trusts weekly or sometimes twiceweekly for the past 4 years she went a long time unmedicated and only a few years ago went on a popular ssri for the first time that was prescribed by her pcm its worked pretty well to stabilize her and give her that buffer to make the lows less low but over time shes still getting worse what she wants and i agree is to see a psychiatrist to get onto an actual medically endorsed path to improve her situation and control her ssri while were grateful we got her on an ssri and it has made a difference i think its kind of crazy that we can mess with her brain chemistry by just getting a script from someone completely unqualified and without an actual medical program or systematic profile to give her an onramp to improvement here just take these pills youll feel better is kind of how it seems to be treated heres the issue our pcm retired and its not a 6mo wait to see a new pcm just for an introductory meeting we need the intro meeting in order to get a referral to a psychiatrist what are our options to shortcircuit this process a little bit should we just offer to pay cash out of pocket just to get an initial consult with a psychiatrist i feel like her situation has gotten a lot worse recently and dont want to wait another 6mo just to see a pcm just to get a referral to go onto another waitlist for a psychiatrist for 612mo from nowit could literally be years before she sees someone granted part of this is our fault we should have tried to get the referral in while we still had a pcm for her previously looking for advice on getting her to a psychiatrist as quickly as possible tia,post-pandemic,0.09580485,0.17435646,0.08621609,0.23198615,0.12447008,0.56864387,0.1294049,0.0935018

im 28 and ive struggled with social anxiety all my life and i would say through the years my self esteem has dipped into the point of a negative spiral where in 2019 i began seeing a therapist and taking antedepressants over the years ive had no real growth in dealing with my social anxiety and now i feel emotionally numb constantly laying in bed all day not ever wanting to go out to see friends wishing i was home doing something else when i am with friends overall just feeling like i exist but im not living i cant develop hobbies or atleast ive tried and nothing sticks and it feels like im faking it to try to like it recently ive tried to have a burst of motivation through thinking to my self i feel like i get in my own way and i cant accomplish anything besides school as that was straightforward and understandable for me i know who i want to be then i should be able to become that person maybe i am just so down because ive let myself down im looking for a therapist again and came across a place that offers tms therapy along with counseling psych and other therapies i learned all about it from a free visit and i have heard of tms before on the radio i decided to talk to my siblings about it but my culturefamily are not too understanding of mental health the obvious concern is that tms works on your neuronsbrain and that sounds scary but also they wonder if i even need it that its really down to me just getting up and getting out there and i know thats definetly part of the process but i feel like ive been trying i dont know if ive been trying my hardest but i have tried like to them they seem to think i am unhappy but how can i be chronically unhappy when the past 6 years have been nothing but financial gains for me i am in a great position in life but emotionally and socially i am not so where does the goal post end am i depressed or am i unhappy we can dig this hole as deep as we want but at a certain point it has to be one or the other right tms therapy isnt guaranteed and its not a shock therapy and it seems to be pretty safe yet i think to myself maybe i dont need all that maybe i just really have to give it my all this year or im not suicidal so maybe im not really depressed i just want to feel and enjoy life and grow as a person but i cant even decide if im sick or not in 2019 i did see a cbt therapist who i think did diagnose me with major depression but also this same therapist when she had to stop seeing me said i think youre a great person and that theres nothing wrong sure she can say that to cheer me up but its confusing tldr not sure if i am depressed or just not trying hard enough,post-pandemic,0.11265637,0.26846832,0.76145923,0.9168139,0.7425873,0.89117897,0.14586444,0.6374191

tw i talk about how i havent ever done sh i wont or attempted to take my life idk if i did that right but i dont want to make anyone uncomfortable currently there is little to keep me going every morning i wonder what my life would be like if i just didnt breathe anymore i oftentimes find myself wanting that alternate universe where my parents find me dead which sounds awful but i dont know how to word it without sounding worse i have a lot of friends and an amazing boyfriend so loneliness isnt really the problem i do at times find myself feeling lonely but thats never really the main issue its more so my self esteem and the fact that im not getting better im actually getting worse anytime i mention this to my parents my mom specifically they just tell me that this is how being a teenager goes which i get but this has been happening since before i even started puberty more on that later so i know that its not just hormones when i told my mom i wanted to go to therapy she said that she would look into it and she never did which would be fine if i didnt ask to get a therapist multiple times i told her a while ago that nothing has been getting better and that i wanted to explore more options rather than exercising doing yoga and using coloring books for reference i also have insomnia and she thinks that if i exercisemake my body tired or make my brain tired by coloring that my insomnia will get better and she started yelling at me about how my only other option is taking pills which she is completely against i am to a certain point but i truly have tried just about everything to make the insomnia better and nothing has helped my aunt is currently on pills for either anxiety or depression maybe both idk and i guess its a larger amount because my mom told me do you want to be hooked on pills huh they get you on a small dosage and then make it bigger and bigger you do not want that and so on now on the biggest issue my self esteem my self esteem has always been low to be honest i didnt have many friends growing up and so i always feel insecure about myself being ugly being annoying etc ive grown up hating myself because thats what the environment i grew up in when i went to school it used to be my clothes i never had cute clothes then it was if i was annoying or not then if i was smart enough now its my looks i have had problems with acne in the past and im still struggling with it but i recently got these spots on my face that are red circular and itchy i learned that it was eczema and i started taking medication for it for about a week and then i put creams on it it was getting better and then i woke up this morning and saw that theyre back this really bummed me out like really bad i cried this morning and since ive been home today ive been crying a lot i tried calming myself down with my comfort movie and that didnt work ive never done self harm and i wont as im afraid of pain and i wont kill myself for the same reason ive thought about it but never acted on it there isnt anything wrong with my life to be honest outside of myselfesteem i have a great family and friends my boyfriend is the best but i find that the only reason why im alive is because i dont want anyone to be sad about it im hanging on by a thread please give me advice,post-pandemic,0.11405482,0.12124922,0.7895584,0.7216387,0.9468438,0.8080276,0.11816765,0.3944474

hey so i have been struggling with depression for at least 10 years now i had a very hard time years back when i was taking medication and tried therapy it kinda ended when i came together with my now ex we were together for 7 years and i ended it last november just was not working out anymore i struggle a lot again lately obviously due to the breakup as well some things about me i try to maintain a few friends in my life i am really shy self esteem is basically non existent whatever i try to achieve i always think i will fail in the back of my head to feel at least a bit comfortable in groups of people i would have to drink alcohol the only time i am in groups of people would be the weekend i dont drink on weekdays on the other hand the alcohol makes me feel mentally even worse on the next day after a night out if i have the time i will just lay in darkness in my bed for 2 days barely eating or doing anything i am basically feeling like i am barely keeping my head over the water most of the times of course there are rare occasions where i feel better but 90 of the time i just dont enjoy life i would say i am a very sensitive person and every little inconvenience just totally knocks me off my feet and i cant deal with life very efficiently i just dont know what i am doing all this for why do i have to do this whats the point i just have nothing to look forward to and feel like a useless piece of shit i dont get how other people can just be happy in life with this being said suicidal thoughts are there as well every now and then it just feels calming knowing to have the option to end it i have not tried anything yet tho this didnt all start with the breakup it just got worse i am currently trying to finish my bachelors degree and it is just super hard for me to focus on anything related to it i also started going to the gym on a regular basis which i really enjoy i already talked to my doctor about my mental state lately and she said i dont lack any nutrients or anything which would benefit my bad mental state so do you guys have any ideas what could help me maybe you have been in a similar situation and broke out of it of course the most reasonable next step would probably be to get therapy i will try to do that but it takes a very long time where i live sorry for the long post feel free to ask me anything,post-pandemic,0.05112379,0.13667873,0.3264273,0.4565779,0.6145297,0.77066064,0.0762692,0.1391105

and pen pals i lived in new jersey and she lived in iowa in 2017 she decided to visit me and traveled on a bus for 18 hours across the country to visit me in my hometown and we met for the first time after multiple nights talking endlessly on the phone sending letters and listening to music together on the bedroom floor i never thought i would be capable of finding love especially online i remember that night like yesterday i met her behind a hotel underneath a streetlamp in the shadows we stood there like two silhouettes beneath the moon i didnt tell my family about her arrival and i left my house in the middle of night to go see her and walked across town we kissed and danced in the hotel room listening to smokey robinson and the miracles as i cried on her shoulder we had sex and it was so romantic nothing lustful at all our love was pure and innocent i have to admit she was far more innocent than i was and i felt so blessed to have her in my life she was perfect and i knew she was the one i wanted to marry one day she stayed for three days and then last day she cried and we said goodbye and i gave her poem i wrote and she left on the bus back to iowa that day i cried helplessly and wandered my town because i couldnt believe she was gone fast forward a year later i planned to see her and i traveled to her small hometown in sioux city iowa i remember the time we spent ice skating together and falling on the ground and ignoring everyone else while we were being watched and judged i remember wandering through ghost industrial town at night during the winter and dancing under the stars in a park where there was a statue of virgin mary above us covered in snow we listened to an our favorite album and drove through the winter night and explored ghost town i spent a summer with her swimming in lakes and picnic dates and sleeping in the woods and dancing in our rooms and reading books and writing songs together and watching movies and falling asleep by a tree it was wonderful it all ended unfortunately its tragic her brother died of an alcohol overdose and i had gone through severe mental health issues while being back at home and school etc i wanted to change my life around and move out there with her but it was impossible financially during that time she secretly fell in love with another man who was pen pal who happened to be in prison the last time i saw her i left her apartment in iowa and drove back home to new jersey with my belongings and said goodbye on her doorstep all i know is that she is planning to move out of her town and spend her life with her pen pal she found her true love that hotel we first met in my town has been redecorated and changed so all my memories have gone with it father son and brother ghost story my dad was never actively part of my life he is like a ghost just recently hes attempted to enter my life and he invited me to meet him at a restaurant and shared how my mom tore us apart which is not true he then offered me to go to a music store and look at keyboards together since my dad is a pianist and its probably where i get my love of music from i didnt want a piano or any gifts from him i just wanted his attention and experience a normal father and son relationshipi also got to meet my halfbrother for the first time through my dad due to trauma and estranged relationship the three of us will never be able to come together and be family of brothers my halfbrother showed me a video of my dad playing piano on his phone and made me sob because i wish i could have learned how to play piano like my dad and three of us can bond together he said we would hang out again ive called him and hes never answered his phone for months i asked him to meet me in new york as a restaurant as planned and called me and made up an excuse to ghost me i drove two hours for nothing i stood there restlessly across an empty table and spoke to random strangers and couples and pretended i was waiting for someone special and lied to them about him showing up several months later i was admitted to the hospital and i told him i was suicidal and i called and he answered he never said happy birthday or happy new years or thanksgiving one thanksgiving as i was cutting the spine of a turkey i had a revelation and said to myself the worst thing a father can do to his son is take his spine out i felt that symbolic relationship with the turkey like take his pride or dignity out i feel like my father did that to me and left me hollow and paralyzed that thanksgiving i was with my step dad and his family and i was so depressed because for one time in my life i wanted to spend a thanksgiving with my halfbrother and real dad and feel that connection i never had what was the point of him trying to enter my life weirdly the same thing with my halfbrother all contact stopped for a year what was the point of meeting him at his apartment what was the point of any of this i never heard from them that night when my dad ghosted me at that restaurant i sat at the table surrounded by crowds of happy people couples and families i stormed out of there and tears running down my face i shouted and kicked things in the street while people looked at me like i was crazy and didnt understand why i was so upset i drove all the way back home down the dark pitched highway to my hometown my lost city tales i spent two summers in new york roaming around aimlessly and trying to find friends and develop new connections during these summers i tried a dating app and i wont get into it too heavily but i was ghosted and lied to by two women on the app one particular girl lived in baltimore maryland and ghosted me after several dates and played with my emotions and simply returned to her previous husband i was heartbroken and i took some pills my antipsychotic medication and passed out in my car on the highway during this time i often traveled to new york and i had made one friend there from this record store who involved in this music scene in brooklyn this friend had invited me to go see him perform as a dj at this club and for a while i helped him drive him to his sets with my cars one night i was invited to meet him at this club and he completely ignored me around his friends on the dance floor i was also experiencing a depressive episode at the time wrong time and place of course i stormed out of the club and found a street corner and sat on a milk crate and pile of trash and cried helplessly nobody called me and i had no friend to talk to the last part of this story is that one morning fast forward i decided to go to the city for the weekend to enjoy myself at this club in brooklyn and i wanted to enjoy myself for once and have fun and meet people i arrive there and before i go inside i cry behind my driving seat and drink some alcohol to loosen myself up and calm my anxiety i couldnt stop shivering and a woman and her friends pass my car window and she asked if i was okay i didnt know what to say and so i shook my head and smiled as if everything was okay moments later i am not lying about this shit at all as i am locking my car door and i asked politely for a man in his car for a lighter to light up a cigarette two guys come rushing behind and one guy hits me the back of the head with something idk what it was some object and i was stunned momentarily i heard some screaming and i couldnt remember the rest i thought they were trying to rob me and they ran

it absolutely scares me that my medication simply has no effect i dont feel any different ever it started being bad in early 2020 and i got a diagnosis for depression in late 2021 had 8 months of therapy even double hours and long courses on autogenic training stress management how to deal with emotions journaling etc during this i was put on mirtazapine but nothing improved my doc changed it to sertraline nothing improved i was referred to a psychiatrist who increased my sertraline dose up to 200mg nothing improved got quetiapin for nights where i cant deal with it only took it two times got slightly tired but still no effect on the general sadness and hopelessness etc all i experience is just horrible now beginning of 2024 i was switched to bupropion because even my psychiatrist is in disbelief that nothing worked almost 6 weeks on it again absolutely nothing improved no change whatsoever i feel like i took nothing meanwhile i underwent all sorts of tests breathing gas analysis bloodwork especially tsh to check my tyroid and they cant find any deficiencies of anything off i feel absolutely zero positive effect from any of this and that worries me so much i feel doomed i dont know what to expect i just need to get this off my chest because the thoughts choke me it took me so much effort overcoming mental blockades and cost to reach out for professional advice and so far all help has failed this summer i will use my vacation to seek out a clinic where they can hopefully investigate wtf is up with me it makes no sense i live in a city with only like 10k people not in the us and all the medical practices of psychiatry and even a neurogogist here knows me by now been everywhere no change i feel so lost i wish i could cry forever and just rot away,post-pandemic,0.13110307,0.2460319,0.1904108,0.78408796,0.116046704,0.8358364,0.13428225,0.3897342

when i was younger i knew of a classmate whose parents were separated or has issues w each other i didnt know her well back then in primary school from all i know she was a terrible sly friend to me throughout as i grew up and thought of divorce i felt sad and sorry all over i thought it was such a horrible and unfortunate thing to experience putting aside social conventions of how its looked down upon in my country i felt very sad for the kids who in my mind would have to endure it and choose in the divorce watching two people you love separate two people whom you thought loved each other this is still true to an extent today no way am i supporting divorce for any difficult relationship by the way but now when i think of a person my age telling me their parents are divorced i feel jealous i wish my parents were divorced i wish i lived w my mum and my mum only im jealous of these kids whose parent were able to take them away to safety build a life for them and hopefully recreate a possibility of positive connections between themselves and with others i understand that not every divorce is amicable and divorce leads to many consequences but staying together for the kids never work and never will ive been brought down a stroll through memory lane gaslighted and guilttripped into explaining that i dont want them to divorce when i realized yesterday that it was my biggest regret of not enabling i should have made them divorced on my life they might have been in love once but now they hate each other so very much the nostalgia remains for me its the most bitter part but the incompatibility and intolerance leading to emotional physical and financial abuse from my dad a lack of decisiveness and refusal to separate from my mum i guess leads to them fucking my life up thats why ive been repeating i hate you mouthing it to the ceiling while spilling tears as i lay on my bed for 30 mins now this is hell on earth i could be 40 i am 19 presently and they would go on forever like this until their last breath when the word divorce started to appear in my mind between their fights and arguments i thought it was scary and ugly i loved them and i didnt want them to break up but it would actually be the most freeing thing ever i swear it would free me forever,post-pandemic,0.13814296,0.09503944,0.25553307,0.4570818,0.46968186,0.8379061,0.091675274,0.20133102

this holiday got my fucked up thinking about all this shit tragic romance i found my first girlfriend on an online chatroom in 2014 while i was at college during my freshman year we started as friends and pen pals i lived in new jersey and she lived in iowa in 2017 she decided to visit me and traveled on a bus for 18 hours across the country to visit me in my hometown and we met for the first time after multiple nights talking endlessly on the phone sending letters and listening to music together on the bedroom floor i never thought i would be capable of finding love especially online i remember that night like yesterday i met her behind a hotel underneath a streetlamp in the shadows we stood there like two silhouettes beneath the moon i didnt tell my family about her arrival and i left my house in the middle of night to go see her and walked across town we kissed and danced in the hotel room listening to smokey robinson and the miracles as i cried on her shoulder we had sex and it was so romantic nothing lustful at all our love was pure and innocent i have to admit she was far more innocent than i was and i felt so blessed to have her in my life she was perfect and i knew she was the one i wanted to marry one day she stayed for three days and then last day she cried and we said goodbye and i gave her poem i wrote and she left on the bus back to iowa that day i cried helplessly and wandered my town because i couldnt believe she was gone fast forward a year later i planned to see her and i traveled to her small hometown in sioux city iowa i remember the time we spent ice skating together and falling on the ground and ignoring everyone else while we were being watched and judged i remember wandering through ghost industrial town at night during the winter and dancing under the stars in a park where there was a statue of virgin mary above us covered in snow we listened to an our favorite album and drove through the winter night and explored ghost town i spent a summer with her swimming in lakes and picnic dates and sleeping in the woods and dancing in our rooms and reading books and writing songs together and watching movies and falling asleep by a tree it was wonderful it all ended unfortunately its tragic her brother died of an alcohol overdose and i had gone through severe mental health issues while being back at home and school etc i wanted to change my life around and move out there with her but it was impossible financially during that time she secretly fell in love with another man who was pen pal who happened to be in prison the last time i saw her i left her apartment in iowa and drove back home to new jersey with my belongings and said goodbye on her doorstep all i know is that she is planning to move out of her town and spend her life with her pen pal she found her true love that hotel we first met in my town has been redecorated and changed so all my memories have gone with it father son and brother ghost story my dad was never actively part of my life he is like a ghost just recently hes attempted to enter my life and he invited me to meet him at a restaurant and shared how my mom tore us apart which is not true he then offered me to go to a music store and look at keyboards together since my dad is a pianist and its probably where i get my love of music from i didnt want a piano or any gifts from him i just wanted his attention and experience a normal father and son relationshipi also got to meet my halfbrother for the first time through my dad due to trauma and estranged relationship the three of us will never be able to come together and be family of brothers my halfbrother showed me a video of my dad playing piano on his phone and made me sob because i wish i could have learned how to play piano like my dad and three of us can bond together he said we would hang out again ive called him and hes never answered his phone for months i asked him to meet me in new york as a restaurant as planned and called me and made up an excuse to ghost me i drove two hours for nothing i stood there restlessly across an empty table and spoke to random strangers and couples and pretended i was waiting for someone special and lied to them about him showing up several months later i was admitted to the hospital and i told him i was suicidal and i called and he answered he never said happy birthday or happy new years or thanksgiving one thanksgiving as i was cutting the spine of a turkey i had a revelation and said to myself the worst thing a father can do to his son is take his spine out i felt that symbolic relationship with the turkey like take his pride or dignity out i feel like my father did that to me and left me hollow and paralyzed that thanksgiving i was with my step dad and his family and i was so depressed because for one time in my life i wanted to spend a thanksgiving with my halfbrother and real dad and feel that connection i never had what was the point of him trying to enter my life weirdly the same thing with my halfbrother all contact stopped for a year what was the point of meeting him at his apartment what was the point of any of this i never heard from them that night when my dad ghosted me at that restaurant i sat at the table surrounded by crowds of happy people couples and families i stormed out of there and tears running down my face i shouted and kicked things in the street while people looked at me like i was crazy and didnt understand why i was so upset i drove all the way back home down the dark pitched highway to my hometown my lost city tales i spent two summers in new york roaming around aimlessly and trying to find friends and develop new connections during these summers i tried a dating app and i wont get into it too heavily but i was ghosted and lied to by two women on the app one particular girl lived in baltimore maryland and ghosted me after several dates and played with my emotions and simply returned to her previous husband i was heartbroken and i took some pills my antipsychotic medication and passed out in my car on the highway during this time i often traveled to new york and i had made one friend there from this record store who involved in this music scene in brooklyn this friend had invited me to go see him perform as a dj at this club and for a while i helped him drive him to his sets with my cars one night i was invited to meet him at this club and he completely ignored me around his friends on the dance floor i was also experiencing a depressive episode at the time wrong time and place of course i stormed out of the club and found a street corner and sat on a milk crate and pile of trash and cried helplessly nobody called me and i had no friend to talk to the last part of this story is that one morning fast forward i decided to go to the city for the weekend to enjoy myself at this club in brooklyn and i wanted to enjoy myself for once and have fun and meet people i arrive there and before i go inside i cry behind my driving seat and drink some alcohol to loosen myself up and calm my anxiety i couldnt stop shivering and a woman and her friends pass my car window and she asked if i was okay i didnt know what to say and so i shook my head and smiled as if everything was okay moments later i am not lying about this shit at all as i am locking my car door and i asked politely for a man in his car for a lighter to light up a cigarette two guys come rushing behind and one guy hits me the back of the head with something idk what it was some object and i was stunned momentarily i heard some screaming and i couldnt remember the rest i thought they were trying to rob me and they ran

is change inevitable and why is it that i am not satisfied with the change that has happened never like never have i been happy about something that has happened to me maybe temporarily but it wasnt from the heart if i have one at this point i know i am selfish but i didnt know i could ruin myself to the extent i have done yesterday i fought with my mom and made her cry and didnt feel anything wrong about what i was doing i know its disgusting and writing about all of this is pointless but what do i do its my only escape and the only thing that is keeping me sane cuz even the thought of dying cuz my parents would feel miserable doesnt bother me anymore yes it has gone to that point i sought for help and somehow it got worse the meds make me numb anxious restless empty irritated and even more depressed thats all i had a emotional trauma as the doctor told me and not a panic attack during lecture yeterday and i was about about to jump from the third floor of the building cuz thats all i can think about the people who understood me and supported me are taken away from me and i dont have the escape i used to have when they were with me cigarettes i am partially content with them but just smoking is not the only thing i crave i crave it when i wanna talk to those who told me affirmative words even though i denied them i am selfish i know i am hypocritical i want that the attention i used to get i know when my parents will leave i will selfharm again cuz thats the only escape to my pain and i cant do that now as i was the one who sought for help not them who came to me as well wishers or something and someday not now obviously i have been like this for six years now i will kill myself cuz thats how you get the kind of peace i want when i am 25 i am sure i would atone for all my sins before that by being independent cuz thats all my parents care about and then give care and love to them so that they dont have to bother about me anymore and then i will cut everyone away from my life like i did in 11th grade and jump from the roof of the building which has 20 floors i live in and experience that fresh air for a few fraction of seconds before gaining the eternal peace i beg for now or maybe i can just hang myself in the lonely flat that i own cuz thats how i wanna be and i dont wanna be noticed or found dead unless people smell the rotting body of mine cuz thats what i deserve yeah i wish they never find me cuz even my soul would be ashamed of the mind flesh and bones i own right now like other people do thats the only thing i own honestly i dont have anything else thats how i imagine it its just so dreamy and a beautiful idea isnt it even divine i will say this i feel like i dont deserve that also cuz its too much to ask but i will do everything in my power to end this endless suffering i have to go through to gain that peace,post-pandemic,0.6319382,0.21963179,0.466574,0.9582951,0.30066785,0.9157891,0.56127715,0.842842

why be happy and defeat depression with no afterlife with no afterlife or reason for being here we are left with life as it lies before us preceding the opportunity we get to choose to interpret its results the possibility for any event to occur is best described by a system of mathmatics that is nearimpossible for both the layman and the genius to comprehend the metaphysical reasons for these mathmatics is a debate that while philosophically enjoyable is ultimately unawnserable but the impossibility of the existence of an answer is why we should be content with our reason for existing in the first place the likelihood of you existing your history and even the event of you reading this text are so improbable that the existence of it alone should be celebrated it may be that there is no definitive answer to the why and comprehension of this concept will always be a struggle as this introspective odyssey has plagued us for millennia but the fact that it is even being questioned is a testament to human greatness our ability to quest for truth evidences the beautiful luck we have to be the ones on the very journey we find ourselves contending to begin with no matter how desperate life becomes the fact that we can call it as such is so immeasurably preferable to nothingness that it exemplifies why true appreciation of the fact of existence is not only a reality but is conducive and paramount to discovering an undefinable yet veraciously concluded unanimous happiness because of our ability to reason only we as humans on this earth have the opportunity to experience this kind of contentment and while human societies around the globe waste this life and destroy the opportunities we are afforded you as an individual still have the ability to be joyfully purposeful be free of the moral chains that our societies cast you in for you are real so you are true you are that truth we forever attempt to seek you are what is beautiful in this temporal realm that is fortunate to be you should do nothing but rejoice you need not the metaphysical realities put forward by the potentially destructive socially created philosophies of religious entities to simply love the experience of our stunning preexistence they are inherently a misunderstanding of the beauty of being because to survive is optional but to live is to succeed regardless of what may come after death if i provide anyone reading this with anything it would be this use the capacities you are given as a living being as best as you can because the best luck youll ever ascertain is to live in the first place i hope i contribute happiness to all those i meet ultimately the words i have written before you is the opus i hope to leave behind to describe why i believe all of us deserve and are able to achieve ultimate happiness hate is therefore the enemy of this existential discovery and for that love should forever be the ubiquitous retort gaz ps i struggled with mental health disorders due to losing my boyfriend and suffering severe physical health disorders rendering me partdisabled i have plenty reason to recede into a emotionally destructive pit but i am forever happy now as a result of this here described eventual moral epiphany and i write this so that others may defeat the horrific realities we can be forced to suffer that is i think the only reason i survived i promise only one thing as a result you are human and so you are beautiful thank you for reading,post-pandemic,0.11096694,0.14163171,0.0817726,0.27899405,0.13585077,0.5485421,0.17582168,0.12497742

my depression doesnt make me sad or feel worthless if someone was to ask me do you feel worthless my answer would be no im not worthless but i know that im worthless and it doesnt make me feel sad just neutral i dont feel like the world is against me or trying to drag me down or wants me to fail in fact i feel like the world wants me to win i have an amazing family good friends and an incredibly caring girlfriend its this feeling of knowing that i have the potential to do good and be someone successful and its not even out of reach i know that if i just put in effort and tried i could do it but i cant i dont know if its because somewhere deep down i dont want to succeed or what like right now the thought of dying is so peaceful but i know thats not an option yet its like if someone were to ask me if i wanted to die i would answer no being alive is a gift and im happy that im alive but im not at the same time its hard being alive knowing that people believe in me and want me to succeed it would be so much easier if everyone thought i wouldnt ever accomplish anything and gave me reasons to quit i have only positive and happy people surrounding me and i love it and i hate it at the same time stop believing in me and let me fail but at the same time keep believing in me because i want to succeed and i know that i can i love that you believe in me and i hate it at the same time its this feeling of i dont deserve the blessed life i was given and i wish i could give it to someone who deserves it more than me but i know that i can live up to my potential i think that its mostly anger really im mad that i know that i can do it if i apply myself but im holding myself back and i know it why try so hard its difficult stop in fact lets just not try at all its easier that way and i hate that i think like that and i dont at the same time i agree with thoughts like that but again i know its not true and i can do it if i applied myself so i dont agree with them its like the cartoon devil and angel i have the angel on my left shoulder telling me i can do it and that everyone i know believes in me while the devil on the right tells me that i dont have to because its hard and everyone will understand if i dont i agree and believe in the left while i also agree and believe what the right tells me its like the left says you got this man all you gotta do it apply yourself and youll go so far i know that you will and everyone else does too while the right says ah but do you really want to we could also not do that i dunno maybe im making excuses for myself maybe im just lazy its like im drowing and im begging myself to swim but no matter how much i beg i cant,post-pandemic,0.16627702,0.06362981,0.44607168,0.75205684,0.69448537,0.838963,0.15611903,0.42445222

to feel so hallow to feel nothing but the feeling of nothing is the most painful of all its like the dark after being in the blazing sun in the desert stranded without water you want to stay in the dark to not feel the dryness of the sun so you stay its comfortable so you stay you eventually you loose your light and your ability to find the door or the ladder to climb out you have ideas of what you want to do outside in the sun but you cant seem to find your way to the door because its too dark you are lost in the darkness and feel that emptiness is consuming you so you hide in the dark not knowing you are further and further away from the door out but you dont care because you know the dark its predictable it cant change it cant hurt your feelings it cant lead to disappointment because it is safe eventually you start to feel hallow and numb its a relief for a while until you remember what its like in the sun you want to have both but are so lost and alone so you take solitude in the dark alone and thats you strength for the moment until you start to feel again feeling what its become what emptiness is truly feels like feeling alone in a crowed room then to feel the pain from feeling nothing for so long is the worst you know you are so far from finding the door that leads to the light you are alone at this point from staying in the darkness for too long you cant see a path to the door so you feel hopeless you feel disgraceful in your self for getting this far away from the light you just want to crumble from self disappointment from what you have become and how far away you have gotten from the light this realization can be seen as a turing point for some but to others its painful and scary to get on the path and pick yourself up to fight to find the door in the darkness it hurts and its going to hurt so some may slip further into the darkness at this point instead of finding the door they can just get so sick and tired of going thru this because they have been here too many times and i cant tell you its tiring as all hell you just get so sick of trying so tired of fighting so hard to keep bumping around in the darkness trying to find the door and the hollowness that come then the pain of feeling so empty its tiring and you just want to curle up in the corner in the darkness to just feel numb without the pain of it this is what it feels like to fight depression everyday you wake up you wake up sometimes thinking maybe ill feel different or you just wake up feeling numb or the need to turtle and hide because the path to coming out of it is lonely painful and frightening not having someone who actually gets it can be even harder the only way to truly get it is to have been there your self,post-pandemic,0.15120462,0.1339581,0.82039785,0.85507274,0.9302217,0.86602366,0.13527733,0.5974934

i 17f have found a picture of myself from when i was 12 and i literally look exactly the same most people are shocked when i tell them my age because everyone assumes that im 12 or 13 max i have never been bothered by looking young actually i prefer it even my mum thinks i look exactly the same on that photo like it could have even been taken on the same day however later on in the day i told my dad how ive not changed since the photo and i kind of said it as a throwaway comment but my dad replied with saying that i dont really look the same because i now have crows feet i am shocked but im not at the same time because of a previous conversation with my dad but im shocked because i definitely dont have crows feet a couple of months back when i was at a bus stop with my dad he looked like he was examining my face especially my eyes and then he just said that im getting crows feet i was quite offended since his tone was serious so i questioned him why he said that he brushed it off by saying that it was a joke and when i questioned him again he would say honestly it was just a joke to see your reaction i mostly believed him but the seriousness of his initial tone made part of me think he was just covering up what he meant he then said it a second time but i dont remember how it came up but he brushed it off as a joke again but today he confirmed my suspicion of him thinking this when he told me that he meant it and that its normal for 17 year olds to have crows feet to be honest i have never associated crows feet with 17 year olds and i can confirm that i dont have crows feet even though my dad said that wrinkles start to develop at this age it has made me feel very hurt since for some strange reason i already feel like an old woman my dad also told me to use moisturiser which i already do but it upsets me that hes taking to me like i need skincare for mature skin i know that this really does sound like a first world problem but i already lack confidence and my dads treatment of me not just this instance makes me think that he honestly views me as a middle aged woman do you think my dad could be jealous of my youth hes 53 btw,post-pandemic,0.40030617,0.1516174,0.12211328,0.4946538,0.18291506,0.7267189,0.10623836,0.22956209

i think its a common defense mechanism to convince ourselves we dont need something we actually really want whether its a relationship friends attention recognition forgiveness or even the simplest thing we tell ourselves we dont need or even want these things that they are unnecessary and we are better off without if we push them away before they can push us away we will be safe from the pain that in the end its perfectly fine to live a life dependent on only ourselves yet in our minds we feel deep down we desperately need these things we want them so bad it keeps us up at night and we search for them in secret but rarely do we reach out or speak up to obtain them always safer to feel empty than to feel hurt often people dont mean to use these things against us they promise there is hope or that they will give them to us but they get bored leave and even just forget and after you let your walls down only to be hurt again it hurts ten times worse there are so many things i want but have forced myself to suppress people think im always happy strong and capable of being there for others but inside it hurts all the time problem with making our walls stronger and taller is people never seem to understand we can just overcome them overnight,post-pandemic,0.11985579,0.09552104,0.10205828,0.39513683,0.2759538,0.6638965,0.104135565,0.1434262
ive never spoken about this issue before but i feel that its necessary because i need help ive been a depressed person for over 10 years previously i used to believe in rightwing talking points i did hold racist views the thing is it made me feel awful about myself when i held them although i never expressed these views to anyone i knew inside that i believed in it that guilt ate me up i believed that minorities were a threat to me even after i started to come out the other side i still held on to the guilt hatred is a poisonous pill to swallow its so toxic i started to act differently around my family and those i knew im still struggling with the notion that some people are just hateful for the sake of being hateful it makes me feel sick i only developed the opinions i did because i genuinely believed that i was under threat i cant fathom why someone would want to just be horrid for the sake of it i didnt believe that people like that even existed like it sounds like a fictional character or something im slowly coming to the realisation that those people most likely really exist i didnt believe it was even possible for someone to be hateful without reason i guess it shows how naive i was edit i have since read up on everything the farright has done and i feel so much guilt i never donated money or attended marches or anything but i still feel like i helped these people by watching videos talking about strongly conservative subjects its like i helped their ideas gain more traction in the algorithm by just viewing them i dont know i feel a lot of pain not nearly as much as some people whove suffered under the farright but pain nonetheless,post-pandemic,0.445968,0.14752051,0.054513834,0.49346668,0.07480513,0.72655046,0.14246641,0.24337578

m 21 i came out of a 3 year relationship in october that was far from healthy i loved her like i never loved anyone else tho once i stepped back after the relationship and it really opened my eyes to who i really was as a person and how i act in relationships and with people in general and so much shame and self hatred has come from that to the point its just unbearable ive been researching different anti social personalities for months now and find it very hard not to compare my every move to one of these throughout the days and it has just made it seem like life isnt worth living if this is who i am like i dont see myself having a healthy relationship in the future i dont see myself ever changing because even the idea of trying to change is sending me mad with confusion because ive tried to change be happier look after myself save money be more responsible act like an adult and its just like a fake version of me that im putting up to hide the ugly side of me i spend everyday telling people close to me my doctor and my therapist that all this self help stuff im going to do and that im going to help myself and get back on track but really i dont give a fuck if im honest with myself i dont want to get better i spend everyday doing the same shit even tho i know its so self destructive im told over and over its about the mindset and the only person that can save me is me like i know this i just dont give a fuck and go and make the same mistake of not looking after myself resulting in missed shifts at work annoying my parents with my poor hygiene and lack of help around the house im so sick and tired of going for help and being told the same shit over and over like yea some days i want to die i dont wanna be here but i always come to the conclusion that i dont want to kill my self i just really wouldnt care if i died,post-pandemic,0.5451017,0.13271974,0.14654812,0.80148745,0.15033023,0.8507198,0.16597807,0.50877315

hi guys i have been struggling with depression for the last year and i am not sure if i want to keep going the cause of my depression is that i have long been unable to find a romantic partner whenever i love someone they never love me back it is hard to move on but when i do it all just gets repeated i currently am in love with a girl from my class and i dont know what i should do knowing that she would probably not love me back i just sit in class and cry silently when i am on the bus i cry when i get home i cry again and its just a never ending cycle of torment whenever someone talks to her i feel really jealous and start crying again thinking that i am less of a desirable person for whatever relationshipfriendly or not i commit self harm very often by puncturing my arm with a pen in class or slicing my arm with a knife when i get home i think that is what i deserve because i am a nuisance to society and no one probably loves me i get to the class room earlier than anybody else and sometimes i open a window and sit ot the edge hoping that this all ends the second reason for my depression is that i think i am bad at mathematicsi love it even though people and teachers tell me that i am good at it but i still feel that i will fail i know that this might sound dumb and stupid and lightheaded but that is how i feel i was bullied when i was a child and i guess that made me more sensitive i am need help,post-pandemic,0.103458114,0.14932425,0.5558386,0.83961856,0.70622945,0.9212129,0.115188055,0.45294517

im 27m 5 7 and 175180lbs with those stats im officially overweight and i have reason to believe its giving me mild sleep apnea and making me chronically fatigued during the day read my post on rsleep for me details on that i would like to ideally weigh no more than 150lbs but taking the proper steps to lose even 2530lbs seems impossible for me because my life sucks so fucking much and food has become a source of pleasure when my life is otherwise unremitted misery also the thought of reducing my caloric intake gives me anxiety as well because i fear not getting enough calories will exacerbate my fatigue andor cause the feeling of weakness that you get with low blood sugar this causes me to eat larger portions of food than i really need and now here i am at 180lbs heavier than ive ever been in my life i hate it so much,post-pandemic,0.28532314,0.21309964,0.08235648,0.591938,0.052092854,0.71246684,0.15866414,0.31029937

im writing this post not about me but about my borther for the past 2 years hes been in and out of psychiatric hospitals 4 times with 2 suicide attempts on record and at this point i really dont know what i can do to help him his biggest reasons for wanting to commit suicide is that he feels his life unfulfilling and that he has no friends or girlfriend but also he doesnt want to commit to a life of work i think his problem is also rooted in the years of abuse that he suffered under my mothers roof and the lack of psychiatric attention he got as a child as the psychiatrists themselves have said my mother is still a problem because shes not well equipped to help my brother at all being the root of the issue she is toxic and still somewhat abusive and our family is definitely not in a position to help him im not sure where else he could go i dont really know whether we have any family saner than us that can welcome him he cant go to his fathers or his cousins place because of religious differences and at this point im not sure what we can do to help him theres not really that much mental hospitals can do either especially considering he doesnt have the will unlike i do to want to change which makes it even harder since he declines all psychiatric help and refuses to talk to the psychiatrists from the mental hospital we know whats causing all his issues now but we still pretty much cant do anything about it i think the biggest problem is his environment if he werent with us it would be so much easier for him to get back on his feet also the screwed up sites he frequents on the internet but yknow what could we possibly do to help him here,post-pandemic,0.14562827,0.08462455,0.34372762,0.8717128,0.55897206,0.8851729,0.22158043,0.44099006

currently my partner is in the process of getting diagnosed a combination of depression and being overworked for years finally made her seek help we also suspect some anxiety like causes might play into this but thats for the professionals to figure out i myself have dealt with some mental health problems so i understand how hard it can be to seek help so for doing so i am incredibly proud of her even though she hates it when i say that she as called in sick from work for about two weeks now and has been home now the last days i have noticed her slowly sliding deeper in mainly i have noticed how she is selfsabotaging more and more and how shes rejecting help from me more and more and distancing herself from me for example shes laying on the couch wants to go out for a walk but is unable to get off the couch any offer of help or unrelated form of interaction from me is met with comments like i dont want to deal with you or i dont want to explain myself for the record i dont take this personally i can take the offensive comments yada yada i am also sure i did not do anything wrong to upset her she voiced herself that her mood just slid away and now she feels like this i know that she would benefit from a little movementactivity and sunlight but i dont see how i can help her break this selfsabotaging cycle please help,post-pandemic,0.1287393,0.15427415,0.07691929,0.22198893,0.10310024,0.5739934,0.10743467,0.090334944

ive always struggled with a depression of sorts but this past year has been almost overwhelming there has been an internal change in how i process difficulties and im not sure its entirely for the better my depression and stress used to be a permanent malaise kind of like a filter over everything it was mellow in a way sort of like having a consistent weight on you all day everyday its different now i dont feel the weight as much anymore in many ways im coping better than i ever did i adopted new philosophies that was necessary for me to be more consistent with productivity related to me trying to turn something creative into a business everyday i do something productive no matter how small and that in turn leads to something else eventually i gain a bit of momentum from a standstill its good stuff really and i try to pull as much positivity from that as i can which isnt much however my depression has changed instead of being mellow and reliably static its now entirely absent until its there and raging i have these days now where im so completely overwhelmed by despair that i just feel like crying im not a man that cries readily the familiar weight is entirely gone until its present and absolutely crushing my depression has become way more acute and its as exhausting as it is unpredictable today is one such day i know what triggered it i have vivid dreams and those dreams were of semirecent loss it used to be that knowing the source of a thing at least alleviated some of the symptoms but it doesnt work anymore before i would shrug it off and sink into my cloak of familiar gloom now i just panic its stupid because theres nothing to panic about i cant change any of it it just feels so sharp and poignant and i hate it i hate it because im someone who has always been in relative control of all aspects of myself and now i have this thing that pops up suddenly every now and again that is completely debilitating i am struggling and i dont really have a fix other than to keep going on i am strong im not successful and i probably never will be but i have been dealt a bad hand and im doing the best with what i have despite my willpower i have moments now that i feel like im just collapsing in on myself i dont want to and i am resisting but it seems so difficult in these moments of acute despair i have very few positives in my life to balance everything out im pretty much always stressed and i have a mountain of grief from a recent death to work through the world feels so hostile people feel so selfish and so shitty i wouldnt care so much but i have to participate with society specifically social media to promote my work i have to pitch my hard work to a faceless audience of people just looking for a quick story or a 10second fix its all so exhausting i feel like im drowning in an ocean most of the time my life has been a constant struggle to overcome rock bottom and now at 35 im still spinning my damn wheels in my 20s talking to people helped a bit there was a kind of emergent relief that came from just talking through events i dont feel that relief anymore to the point that i dont really see the benefit of speaking my thoughts most of the time ive more or less given up on mental health avenues in society they just dont work for me anymore im not sure if its because im a man or im too old or im too jaded but it really feels like a waste of time at best and frustrating at worst i cant really express myself as i want to even this small rant isnt a representation of how i feel because if i was to say exactly how i am inside it would just be pure anger and vitriol im not allowed to be angry or resentful yet i feel it all the same i feel like i need a month long break in the middle of nowhere that just isnt possible for a number of reasons chiefly financial reasons anyway i just wanted to stand on a soapbox for a bit in a vain effort to try to take some of the pressure off thats all,post-pandemic,0.09984756,0.17602092,0.09823259,0.19569683,0.13281646,0.5114567,0.12482079,0.088034794

i always feel im out of place since primary school i never find myself trying to be friends with any of the people in the class i wasnt interested in any of them i was teased a lot because of my name i used to bring a lunch box to school and my friends find it weird they kept calling me names forward to high school i am a part of a small friend group but i wasnt happy im usually someone who get good marks at school i enjoyed learning and doing homework wasnt burdening me but gradually i lost all motivation sometimes i pass my exams and sometimes i dont i just dont try to achieve high marks anymore i realised i was just a downer since child i never liked to hang around and chat with people i dont mind spending everyday on my own people would scold me for it and tell me that i should spend time with other people i dont think that im antisocial or somebody who does harm to myself or others i just dont get most of people their ways and lifestyle its the opposite of the life i want for myself what people dont understand is that im trying to build a life for my own not for my parents and definitely not for aunts uncles and neighbours living in jakarta as a chinese descendant is a curse i honestly believe that they took away most of my freedom during my teens by forcing me to study 9 hours a day and set me up for failure because i lack the social skills that most people should naturally have at my age because i spent most of my life memorising books and learn calculations the education system is so messed up and i know this is just my opinion since i know some other people who get most out of school however i also believe that there are people out there who thinks just like me now i really wished that i can have my time back because after graduating university people are expecting me to work 8 hours a day and patiently commute from home to work in the traffic just for me to earn a minimum wage something is just not fair and i know that many people would disagree with this i just really dont get the point i wished that teachers and adults would be more transparent and honest with us about how life works and dont just say work hard get high grades and get a good job i feel like i wasted a period of my life where i should be having fun doing stupid things and enjoy the moment but society is not making it possible i understand that you can benefit from having a job family and raising kids and it is much achievable because living in jakarta is relatively cheap compared to other countries for somebody who prioritises family first i think theyll enjoy the social life that jakarta has to offer i just feel like people here dont value passion and mental health is definitely still a taboo subject i tired of people expecting me to be cheerful and humorous all the time its really dehumanizing me although im moving away in 4 months and i cant stand being here anymore i cant help but to feel bad that im feeling like this a part of me wished i could have stayed be nice and friendly with everyone but im tired of dealing with parents cousins and neighbours who wants my time and help when theyre in need but not having a care in the world when im in a crisis,post-pandemic,0.11515034,0.1623678,0.70635825,0.83344924,0.8031034,0.86796397,0.073736414,0.4650191

hey i am lurking here since january when i was diagnosed with severe depression suicide ideation with a date and the whole package but i dont want to talk about that today today i realized that i am not the priority of my friends friend1 promised that he would visit me if i moved with my parents to treat my depression he never came to visit me said that his mothers car had some problems its been a month friend2 is my best friend and im her best friend her words last friday morning i asked if she could talk to me on phone she said yes but she went to the gym after work she goes everyday and only called me at 2200 i didnt think too much about that we talked about going out to eat some food we are both free this week she is on paid leave and i took some time from work since january today is monday we could go any day any hour and she choose friday afternoon tuesday she is going out with her husband wednesday her cousin will visit her lives on the same city thursday she will have a massage and i dont know why she couldnt go today she can cancel any of these appointment she could choose morning or just skip one night at the gym i understand that they have their lives their priorities and maybe they dont understand what im going through but i helped them a lot with carreer and life they would receive half of my money if i died before things got worse i was studying with my best friend 24 times a week 2 hours each day so she could get a less stressful and better job i always say that i dont expect anything from them but this is too much for me i am going back to my city i want to be far away from them so i wont have to go through situations like that i read our chats history and i feel that everything was a lie now i know that i cant count on them when im on my worse i think that people are only willing to help or give attention when its convenient or easy i am on my thirties i feel childish writing this post but its the first time since i started taking meds that i feel i am right i am alone i want stronger meds to feel numb again no one deserves to go through this if you have a friend going through any mental disorder i ask you to go visit them or just call them you dont have to ask for permission in my mental state i dont want to bother anyone but i wish my friends would care and give more attention i dont want to beg sorry about the mess on this post i blame the meds the depression and my bad english,post-pandemic,0.065309,0.13312504,0.3771058,0.62380075,0.52377945,0.8677242,0.090495184,0.21185386

i was diagnosed with depression about 3 and a half years ago and have been treated ever since i got better i could say i was even happy sometimes but things just ended up getting worse 2023 was the most stressful year of my life as it was the last year before college i studied as hard as i could bc i knew that despite the toll it would take on me i would be approved for sure and i was kinda i didnt pass for the university i wanted for 2 points on a test worth about 1000 so im currently in the waiting list i was in the 47th place out of 45 i was able to pass for another but not the one i wanted at least not yet i got sloppy after the test started to see my routine crumble i felt slightly more depressed and constantly took my meds at the wrong time twice as i should in a day or not at all since december ive been feeling even more stressed than i was last year constantly getting angry at my girlfriend family and friends for silly reasons feeling hollow on the inside and many other negative feelings many of you are probably familiar with i noticed these symptoms a couple of weeks ago but i didnt exactly tell no one not even my therapist i feel like its an unconscious tendency of not wanting people to worry about me and be a burden i feel my mind getting more cynical each week not being able to feel happiness in my mothers embrace for a while now feeling constantly unhappy with my relationship and wondering how my life would be if i was single even though my gf is the person i love the most in my entire life one might say right person wrong time feeling out of place everytime i hang out with my friends etc today made me want to post this and probably talk to my therapist i was supposed to go have a sleepover with a bunch of my friends after getting there and playing some games i got annoyed at about some misunderstandings in one of them then i got angry and one of my friends too we argued and then i walked away to another room talked a bit to everyone after including that one friend but the damage was done the mood was as heavy as it gets i stuck for a while longer and decided to go back home instead of sleeping there on my way back i reflected upon my current mental state and realized im fully capable of killing myself at any moment if anything goes a bit beyond my stress tolerance level i think ill just find a way i realised i didnt care about the pain anymore even if i had a gun id probably shoot my heart first just so i could feel something before dying im lucky my building isnt high enough to ensure id die if i threw myself i dont know how much of this is the depression speaking for me idk if i actually dont feel connected to my gf and friends anymore or if im just depressed idk if its even worth it to stick around here or to just let go and i still feel bad for taking your time with this long monologue when you could be helping someone in a worst state than me i just feel miserable i think ill talk to my therapist on thursday i probably wont be as straightforward as i was here bc i dont to make him or my loved ones worry ill just comment that ive been feeling extremely unwell with my social circle and myself for the last couple of months and that i might have thought about suicide again as im writing this i already feel inclined to not do so but ill try i just wanted to get this out im sorry if it ended up taking your time for nothing im sorry,post-pandemic,0.092619374,0.14264806,0.09187555,0.44033512,0.12990652,0.7526404,0.15289131,0.17088571

like everything i want or am working on something opposite happens to ruin it or on rare occassion something better happens when im dealing with something negative its why i can never be constantly in a good mood i try to understand that life is not the best especially as an ugly person but the negative just happens too much that i cant force myself to be happy for long since something bad will come up sooner or later ill give a few examples i can be applying to a job for example and alot of them will straight up ghost me as soon as i make good progress with one then some of the ghosted ones now want to reach out to me coincidentally around the exact same time which also puts more pressure and i end up picking the wrong choice most time i could be having the worst day being in public and then someone randomly decides to make good small talk with me conveinently on that exact same day i could be called really ugly and badmouthed by random women outside and then other women will end up being overtly and extra kind and warm to me or vice versa theres way more stuff like this but these three came to my head immediately shit like that its like some type of invisible balance scale hovers above me made just to ruin or temporarily cheer up my mood the opposite is true as well when im happy i have people try to tear me down or a situation arises i cant even go a month without any type of situation happening i still try and try to be kind i do not even cause any trouble but i think it attracts the opposite i watch as all these bad people get blessed by the shallow world but if an ugly person like me were to even make so much as a mistake its a problem not allowed to be mad when im happy something happens to make it come to an abrupt stop whether it be a situation society etc,post-pandemic,0.2947604,0.101660356,0.0960095,0.41073546,0.19313674,0.73646975,0.082751215,0.17870587
i have become increasingly withdrawn and isolated over time due to the unkindness of others being around people provokes intense anxiety within me to the point where even ordinary errands such as grocery shopping feels incredibly stressful i break out in a sweat and my hands tend to tremble when i walk into any shop i try to breathe deep and exhale slowly so that i do not have a fullon panic attack i was raised in an angry environment where i never had any safe place away from negativity home was a nightmare my parents did not have a harmonious marriage they would often fight and sometimes asked me to choose sides i have a younger sister we no longer speak who was a constant bully in my life my ugliness embarrassed her in front of her peers as she was so pretty and people could not believe i was related to her school was the worst place on earth from preschool to college my little sister would join in on the insults and jokes the clique she is still in at 32 years old felt to me like an angry mob with pitchforks and torches they sought me out to punish me for my face and body do you know what it feels like to be a monster i never made any lasting friendships people just did not like me for whatever reason they chose i remember being in preschool when i found out that kids were mean to me because im uglyi further remember thinking thats it that is the reason it was just so ridiculous to me because i felt i could be unliked for a much better reason for something like i was a jerk or a liar or a bully or just mean for no reasonand i was none of those things this trend continued forever you really know what discrimination is when you experience it from nearly every facet of your life for decades once you feel it you never want to impose it on others trust me it is miserable ive never felt a part of the world more like an outsider how does one even feel like that i feel alien sometimes like ive been waiting for my whole life to either start or hurry up and be over so that i can restart and maybe in a more positive place i hardly see empathy tolerance or humility in the modern world anymore people just live in the microcosm of their own minds maybe i do toomy experience of the world lacks but my knowledge of it does not i feel like im always on the outside looking in seeing life from a completely different angle than everyone else who cannot see any of it,post-pandemic,0.28017226,0.13980892,0.104246,0.6010464,0.21779926,0.73940283,0.088332005,0.20605421

im a 17m and have been struggling with depression for about two years up until recently ive kept this to myself but i decided it was finally time to get help as i was going in a downward spiral so fast i told my mom and i ended up making an appointment to speak with my doctor the issue is im attempting to become a pilot its my only dream and im even graduating a year early from high school which has required so much effort i have a scholarship lined up thats worth quite a bit i have to use this scholarship within a 3 months after receiving it the big issue is the fact that any declaration of depression by a doctor psychiatrist or even a therapist requires a year of treatment regardless of who you are this includes therapy or medication this would kill all my dreams and i think itd make me more depressed fuck even my doctor didnt know what do to im just so stuck and i want help so bad its so hard to do this alone any advice would be appreciated i know people have it worse i just want help,post-pandemic,0.10105221,0.15294488,0.079128675,0.22165428,0.14859138,0.56624323,0.15990478,0.08998455

i just realised i internalised every you should love yourself first and you should work on yourself first bits to the point of firmly believing i am not deserving of love until i fix myself that love can only be only something that my future self gets as a treat for doing all the hard work on myself and being my perfect version which might never be achievable i know other people and love wont change me i am not expecting that to happen i also dont want to be a burden to anyone so i am not getting involved in close relationships but at times it feels like such a sad and unfair idea we are social creatures and i think being loved could be beneficial on a way to getting better and having some kind of motivation or purpose,post-pandemic,0.11876569,0.0777813,0.22015342,0.5457488,0.46332058,0.8189103,0.10874049,0.25738952

20m i feel alone not because i am not loved or because i have nobody around its because nobody truly understands or offer a real solution i feel like i am talking to myself all day trying to figure something out but nothing makes sense everyone uses those cliche phrases like you are not alone there is someone there for you you are loved you are important jesus loves you just hold on one more day but there is no actual help because it doesnt exist probably it feels so empty right now it is as if i am talking to the void and the reason i am posting this is so my primitive biological side gets a reward out of it i dont really think it can get better i just feel fucked up and end up blaming myself but then i think blaming yourself is stupid you are just a result of your surroundings but still blaming your surroundings wont change anything so then i get mad and just want to off myself there is always the phrase you need to let people help you if you want to get better ok and how am i supposed to do that how do i let other people help me it is not like i am choosing to be depressed and fucked up i really need some help or solution but it doesnt seem to exist i just feel like there is no hope everything is lost for me i cannot rationally find a reason why this life is worth living i wake up everyday i am not joking and the first thing in my mind is why i wake up and want to leave this existence i really need help i cant take the suffering i just dont know what to do to make it stop i am so desperate it is embarassing,post-pandemic,0.37761524,0.20167689,0.9087801,0.936746,0.9422729,0.8974166,0.24843876,0.82896334

i lost my father when i was 16 at that time i wasnt feeling strong emotions i even didnt know why maybe because ive already lost so many important people and gone through so much at that age i just considered numbness as a selfprotection mechanism i remember the flashbacks of his funeral where everyone of his colleagues friends and other relatives are crying their heart out while i was just standing there watching like i was on another planet and everything happened was not even true till this day i still havent figured out whether it was due to i was just too weak to face the truth or i already lost the ability to grieve because i just couldnt afford the emotional outburst once again so i hide everything inside instead my father is the role model and a big hero to me when i was a kid i was born with orthopedic disease that i went through several major surgeries to be able to stand up and walk like normal children the memories are blurred but i knew it was there the scenery in the hospital every check ups with my doctor every steps i made forward he was always there when i fought my demons when i face discrimination and my bullies at school because of my physical conditions as a kid when i just feel sad because i couldnt do some of the activities others kid can normally do when my mom got breast cancer he was always there he was the backbone of my family he sheltered me from those sad memories but i lost him just one year after i lost my grandparents who also loved me so much just one year after my mom survived from cancer i lost him that year and everything changedno one helps me to fight my demons anymore that i pretend everything is ok looking back at my life when i am 21 now i finally realized i have to cultivate the courage to admit that i never really recovered from my loss and it haunts me like ghosts my mom is a strong woman so optimistic also a cancer survivor i just kept my mouth shut because she also gone through so much and i didnt want her to worry i developed severe social anxiety because i am afraid of losing someone again so i just isolate myself and never let my walls down i dont have confidence in myselfhave guilt towards myself and hatred towards myself because i thought part of me my fathers death was because of mehe began smoking when i was badly ill as a kid and the stress on his shoulder to provide finnancially for my family and especially me caused it so he got lung cancer the sadness and pain is actually there and it becomes more prominent each time as i grow order and it is never properly cured i feel drowned in emptiness worthlessness with no more motivation to find peace and reconciliation with myself everyday is a struggle to just wake up and look around and maintain myself functioning no one is aware of my pain but i share all of them here as i thought it might be a safe space i hope i will win my demon as i am officially starting to get help with trauma therapist at my universitys wellness hub this friday,post-pandemic,0.07933183,0.19862562,0.43498108,0.75891715,0.5137266,0.885503,0.11360018,0.31804746

where to start about a year ago me and my ex girlfriend broke up she was my first real love i though wed end up getting married someday we had at that point been together in a long distance relationship for almost 3 years for the first time in my life i felt loved and understood i felt home but as often happened with unconditional love i abused it for a reason i didnt understand i allowed myself to be the worst ive ever been to anyone to the person who absolutely deserved it the least in the world its like a flip would switch in my head i would go from love to no empathy for her what so ever i want to make the disclaimer that although i was very verbally abusive i never paid a hand on her not said i would do anything of the kind felt like it needed to be said to tell you the truth it came to a point where id just been so horrible to her that i ended up not wanting to see her while there were multiple reasons for us breaking up i think a big part was the fact that i wouldnt have been able to look myself in the mirror had i continued to see her i do however feel extremely guilty for abandoning her to her alcoholic family but i felt it would be better with me out of the picture around the same time i had through the prior year become extremely close friends with two guys i wasnt popular as a kid so this was the first time id had friends where we were closer than to our family fast forward about half a year and we were drinking at one the guys house long story short i end up blacking out and apparently starting threatening and being extremely horrible to the guy out of the too that i was the closest to i felt horrible and didnt understand it why was i once again doing this in the following time period i started feeling the same almost bipolar feelings i had to my ex to my best friend it would switch between love and hate over small things it was like because we were so close i wouldnt accept any sort of small things that annoyed me because i believed it was done purposely a few days ago it happened once again i ruined an evening that was a birthday celebration because i felt so much hate for my best friend in the world he didnt even do anything bad to me he had just disagreed on which bar we should go to after the restaurant and i suddenly felt hed betrayed me and tried to turn everyone on me and so now i sit here a few days ago i would have said my life had never been better a job i love my own apartment the best friends i could imagine and on top im dating a wonderful girl and actually felt i was moving on but suddenly yesterday it hit me every time ive gotten for life close to someone i would allow this horrible behaviour i reflected a bit on why this is my relationship with my family has always been rocky my parents were divorced at a young age and not like most parents where things are sort of working out for the kids sake no my parents would actively try to sabotage the respective relationships with the other parents i would be told a horrible secret about the other parent and hate them until they told something worse about the first parent and it would go on like that i felt torn inside like two sides of me was trying to kill each other my relationship with my dad was the worst by far he would go from loving to extremely verbally abusive in seconds over the smallest things maybe i hadnt washed i dish i was supposed and he would get insanely angry over what he assumed was my thought process through not washing the dish he would become a different person he would get all up in my face and looked like he wanted to kill me but because i was being a bad son to my mother in a sort of similar vein to what happened to my ex and best friend i decided to move in with my dad i think maybe because with my father the only person i really needed to be kind and understanding had the capacity to be what he became im afraid that other people i hold close also does which ironically in turn makes me that same as my dad its weird because the more i care about someone the more it means i have to stay away from them i dont really have anyone i can tell these things to so if you read all this i truly appreciate it im not sure if i need help or if its for the better that im not i realise im not clinically depressed anymore but i need help so i dont fall back,post-pandemic,0.3893534,0.08819252,0.3222358,0.803563,0.4596576,0.8886099,0.12360046,0.49097902

i know that there is something wrong inside my head but i have no idea what it is my symptoms manifest in so many different ways its hard to pin down i have variously theorized its depression anxiety or adhd at different times every week i have days where i just feel so awful and find it impossible to do anything trying to put it into words makes me feel so tense and stressed that i feel like hurting myself its like i am just curling up into myself tensing all my muscles and putting every ounce of energy i have into trying to come up with the words to describe whats wrong but just nothing is coming to me and i get so frustrated that i just take it out on myself i yell or pound my feet or fists or i start to hit or hurt myself in some way this makes it almost impossible to function and is usually followed by a bout of severe depression where i can barely get myself to move at all i have no motivation to do anything no interest in anything and then i also feel guilty and anxious that im not doing anything and i get anxious about not getting any work done and afraid and upset and angry because i know theres no escape from this im just gonna wake up tomorrow and have to do it all again and then there are days where i feel pretty normal i dont feel fantastic i still struggle with focusing and motivation but i am able to get stuff done without issue and i can relax and unwind and go for a run or read a book or make myself a meal or go on a walk or anything and feel pretty okay overall this has all been getting worse over the last couple of months today it was triggered by over 24 hours of stress and anxiety over diabetes management it just boiled over to a point where i couldnt deal with it anymore i felt like there was nothing i could do to make myself feel better and i felt like there was no escape i am just going to have to deal with feeling this way forever i feel like i need professional help but i struggle to even describe what is wrong with me because i feel so different depending on the day and time and it doesnt help that there are so many things i need to do to get help the first part being to have a short precise and coherent description of what im feeling is wrong and then finding the right kind of provider to see i have to find a doctor to prescribe medication if i need it and i have to find a good therapist to help me work through my issues but i dont even know what my issue is and no doctor or therapist has been able to help me figure it out and it takes months to get appointments with doctors and therapists and to try to figure out whats wrong with me i feel helpless and so i have no motivation to even try to get help it has been 2 years since i first saw a doctor for mental health issues and i feel no closer to having an accurate understanding of what my mental health issues are than when i started in that time i have been on zoloft wellbutrin and strattera i am currently not on any medications because i never felt like any of the ones i have tried did anything for me i have also been to different doctors psychiatrists and therapists over the last 2 years currently not seeing any therapist this is really long and im sorry for that i dont really have a question but i am just hoping maybe someone here can give me some advice or guidance i am really in need of it right now,post-pandemic,0.10026681,0.2578418,0.20956172,0.7767584,0.14790441,0.8148341,0.11901164,0.35358238

i 22f have known my closest friend 23m for almost five years we met at uni and weve essentially shared a braincell since then there was even some romantic interest there once on his end but weve continued our friendship platonically and have functioned just fine through navigating all that as a result were both very open about how we feel and he knows whenever im not doing well and vice versa a few days ago i had a mental health scare and thought about doing it ive struggled with it before in my teenage years and have been struggling with my mental health these last few months but never that bad i actually felt relief when i thought about it which is so unlike me as im desperately working to fall in love with life again im safe i wont ever do it but it scared the shit out of me and all i wanted was someone to talk to i do often feel like hes never the one to ask how i am first and whenever he does ask its a shallow question that doesnt expect an answer and usually to act as a segue into traumadumping on me were like two peas in a pod and our sense of humour keeps me going i look forward to talking to him but i really want to start asking for more from him and yet i feel like i shouldnt have to ask a good friend to check in on me the definition of a good friend to me is one who at least checks in occasionally out of genuine interest which he does not and i do expect this after i outright told him the day after my scare what was happening and he just tried to offer me mutual therapy ie shared venting but i really just wanted him to listen and hold space for me he then blanked me the whole weekend and tonight until i just texted him weve had a few back and forths just now and ive asked him how he is etc and the conversation has moved on but ive yet to hear him ask how ive been since my episode how do i tell him i need him to ask how i am more i feel selfish for even asking as i dont yet know if hes even in the mood to ask how i am but what i do know is that even if i was not feeling 100 if a friend told me that they were feeling that way i would be there for them in any way they needed me to be and its making me super anxious in the aftermath of that scare knowing that hes not shown much empathy or care for my safety right now i know friends arent meant to be solely responsible for each other but they should be there for each other when they know times are rough i never ask for anything from him which is probs my issue lol and im really in need of a friend to confide in if you havent guessed i dont have any other options right now any advice for this longass vent would be appreciated if you made it this far x,post-pandemic,0.100521885,0.13248686,0.117938675,0.16917753,0.2533933,0.5877978,0.091774344,0.062353212

this isnt supposed to be a negative post its simply something that i observed after getting through a point in my life where i was suicidal and hell i might just sound stupid since im only really a 15 yo not some wise old man on a mountain or anything it never really goes away like people always say its not necessarily a bad thing that it doesnt go away its just human emotion depression is always sort of there when it comes it can get worse or it can get better but having days where you crash into a state of depression is just human emotion in general is human and whos to say a brief version of worse sadness isnt normal my point is when it comes to suicidal depression obviously go get help because therapy can genuinely help most definitely helped for me but dont expect it to immediately poof out of existence doing better is always something to be proud of you got this,post-pandemic,0.121526234,0.17122446,0.08250648,0.46206352,0.09173472,0.7316169,0.1572031,0.1885014

me 28f and my boyfriend of 4 years 29m are in a bit of a slump regarding forward progress with our lives graduating grad school in the middle of covid zapped our opportunities and our motivation and its been really hard to get unstuck were working on it together but he has anxiety and depression and some selfesteem issues from childhood trauma as you do and his confidence is pretty low which breaks my heart im always working hard to build him up hes my pride and joy you know i think the world of him hes so good from his insides out a mench i love him he often catastrophizes imagines the worst case scenario which is me leaving him and sometimes his depression really takes hold and hell need to go lay in bed for an hour or so before he can readjust and levelout i admit i coddle him when this happens i will neglect to tell him the details or caliber of a particular situation or the depth of my personal feelings to avoid making his bad feelings even bigger i need help breaking this cycle i dont know how sometimes he tells me his worst fears that one day his depression will become too much for me to bear and that ill leave him because of it when hes in this headspace he has suicidal thoughts he reassures me that he doesnt want to take action but the thoughts are definitely there that my life would be easier if he just didnt exist he wants to give me the world a painfree life and i love him for it but i dont want a world without him in it by my side and pain is necessary i dont want a painfree life anyway obviously in these situations i tell him its ok dont worry were gonna figure this out together im so sorry you have to carry this weight no one should have to feel these things something along those lines when he tells me his worst fear is his depression becoming too much for me and i respond with the above i feel like im not telling him the full extent of my feelings which is that hes totally right if this continues it will absolutely become too much for me one day and as much as it would hurt me to leave him ill do it and ill be ok i think that may sound kind of savage but i know what i can and cant tolerate and thats just the truth but if i ever told him that it would be an utterly devastating blow honestly he would likely end the relationship solely to spare me from having to carry his weight he would dump me out of compassion which i of course dont want i love this man and i want to be with him but its taking a toll on me his depression and the energy it takes to console him help him be ok and the energy it takes to remain ok myself so he can have space to feels these feelings its a lot my personal trauma is around caretaking which makes this a million times harder i had to parent one of my parents as a child so taking care of people is massively restimulating for me i have a hard time even bringing someone a tylenol and a glass of water without a little flicker of resentment sparking up in my chest much less caring for someone with serious depression and anxiety which i dont have and cant empathize with because ive never felt those things its important to note the unusual perspective here that this element introduces for me his very exhausting depression is probably average if not slightly better than average compared to what i imagine the typically depressed person experiences i have a very small tolerance for caretaking so all of his likely average feelings and actions are amplified for me it feels much bigger to me than it probably is or maybe it isnt im not really sure all i know is my tolerance is low and i get exhausted very quickly im starting to feel really out of alignment with myself when i placate him to make sure the bad feelings dont get even bigger im frequently bottling my feelings in favor of simmering his down i never tell him that his depression frustrates and scares me that i dont know how to help though sometimes thats evident on its own or that im tired if i did these realities would crush him how do i help us both hes on medication for his a and d and does therapy every other week which i am very proud of him for and wont push him to do more at this time its already kind of a lot for him i think and i dont want to jinx it though i dont think he makes as good use of the time as he could he kind of talks about superficial issues instead of the deeprooted childhood trauma that would really fix these relationship issues we have if addressed hes afraid of the pain of facing it all which i understand i am too im in my own therapy probably 4ish hours a week im tryina work on my stuff so i can do my part in making myself as strong as possible which will in turn benefit the relationship ultimately my question is what do i do do i stop coddling him and smack him with the truth sometimes is there grey area between those two things that i dont see would that even be helpful what behavior of mine should i modify what variable can i change to create different results help thank you 3,post-pandemic,0.08196517,0.11003126,0.11462979,0.22466348,0.2400973,0.6871198,0.10087761,0.07829533

i get paid 13hr to deliver blood to hospitals hours away from me and i hear doctors talking about how they get paid 25hr and it makes me feel shitty like i feel so unimportant even though i deliver blood to dying people at 12 in the morning when i get a call i guess its cause im more expendable or soemthing cause this job isnt hard to learn its basically just driving but it makes me feel so crappy that im getting paid so little but at the same time the nurses at my old job got paid 25hr and i was getting paid 16 to be a phlebotomist and stick almost a hundred people a day and sweating and dying and all the nurses did was decide if people get to donate based off a list of things they never really did any actual nurse stuff just sat in their office and only had to deal with donors when they got sent over to them by the people who actually screen the donors taking their blood weight pulse and blood pressure and all other information who also get paid 14hr im so confused by this who decides what someones job is worth like the doctors are talented but theyd be useless if there wasnt anybody to bring them the blood or screen their donors and i doubt theyd even do it themselves cause they are so snobby about us bringing them blood exactly when they want it and get pissed when noone is around to bring it i wish i was talented and not depressed,post-pandemic,0.44538286,0.12234752,0.4025068,0.8947641,0.37737215,0.89365107,0.18027596,0.7571899
im 24f and i think i never had a good year in my life i dont remember much of my childhood and the small i can remember is just trauma or how my mother threatened to kill me i quickly became during middle school a mother to my youngest siblings and as life goes on it just gets worse and worse my parents are and always were abusive distant manipulative and alcoholic i was practically locked down in my house until my 20 so my social skills are rusty to not say catastrophic even if i got two degrees i still cant find a job and the small amount of money i have my parents use it and not for good reasons im trying to get another degree while working for the next year in a better field i hope because being occupied previously worked to not overthinking my situation but it doesnt anymore and now i just cant do anything and its freaking me out im too depressed to even speak with friends and given my lack of social skills i dont have a really good bond with anyone anyway i dont have the strength to even think of my hobbies sleep isnt even good because im still having panic attacks insomnia and sleep paralysis the only reason im still alive is because my youngest siblings need me and i have to be there for them but i dont even know how i find the force to wake up in the morning and even if my mental state is getting better which i doubt the world is just garbage how the hell im supposed to keep going sorry for the bad english,post-pandemic,0.34651172,0.12890027,0.4478163,0.9269062,0.568827,0.91387415,0.20921351,0.6024233
not sure if this post fits here maybe a little background about me i have been depressed on and off since i was 1314 my last major episode started not long before covid pandemic happened then i had smaller ones but i have been handling them better and better i think i can safely say now that i fought it and came on the other side victorious i am 31 now i think for the last 2 years i have finally got the hang of life i have a great job i am almost out of debt i racked up while depressed literally should pay all of it by september i have hope for tomorrow and i am able to take care of my basic needs without a glitch i can say i am happy with my life 99 of the time but every now and then i get reminded of that dark period in my life like i am having some hiccup i am still seeing consequences of my actions when i was in a deep hole or consequences of my lack of action healthrelated financial personal do you guys have experiences like that what do you do so those consequences dont bring you back down i am off my meds at the moment and had to move so i am not seeing any therapist but i also at this point when i was going to see my last one we had very little to talk about now i guess we would have a little,post-pandemic,0.118341506,0.15731543,0.08234985,0.23620176,0.11376662,0.5954127,0.1645999,0.098755285

tldr i want to kill myself to end the toxic cycle of abuse and have an intense fear of becoming abusive like my mother was i have hurt people emotionally and feel guilt and want to die title might sound confusing but hear me out i am a very toxic individual but i never use to until around age 9 thats when i decided to try to commit suicide ive been struggling with depression from 9 years old to 25 and it hasnt gotten any better years of neglect abuse rpe has formed me into someone i longer want to be please do not convince me i do not deserve to die because frankly you have no idea the things i have done i have cheated on partners just to end the relationship i self sabotage i hurt people just to keep them away from me i am a monster and the only way to stop all of this is just to end it now you are probably thinking why not get help well i have therapy has done nothing for me its all the same clich advice therapy is great for identifying problems not really solving them and to be honest i know what my problems are its solving them thats the issue thats all up to me and well i dont know how medication yeah tried that many times ive been in and out of psychiatrist hospitals since i was 9 and here i am still in the same situation i want to end the toxic cycle i dont want to end it up like my mother who was an abusive drug addict thats my biggest fear but sadly ive caused so much damage i have no idea how to be a good person or friend or partner all i feel is hatred towards love or happiness anyone that cares about me i get so mad at them how can they i dont care about them im horrible im mean im cold hearted hate is all i know it makes me depressed but i cant help it its all i was taught i never had positive enforcement i remember when i came out as a vegetarian and my mother hated it and forced me to eat meat with nothing but salt it was awful i remember crying and begging her to stop but she slapped me and told me it didnt make me special for being different and why am i so difficult why cant i be like everyone else dont even get me started when i simply wanted to dye my hair a different color i was called and ugly freak she also knew i was molested at the age of 6 and did nothing by one of her male friends oh and my dad he died when i was 7 drug overdose by accident i dont remember him much sadly oh and school it was no different i was bullied when i was younger for being overweight due to medication and having bad acne but in high school everyone wanted to be my friend because of my glow up but i was a bitch to them i didnt speak to anyone everyone thought i was a psycho they werent wrong if anyone even looked at me the wrong way i would go swinging now i wasnt a bully but if someone said something to me that was an insult i wouldnt hesitate i pushed a girl downstairs for calling me a bitch now as an adult it eats me up inside i feel nothing but guilt and disgust i wish i could apologies but it wouldnt matter anyway i dont deserve her forgiveness after that incident i was kicked out of school and put into an alternative school which the same kind of stuff happened i would get into fights and at this point my mother wasnt around she abandoned me and left out of state i was 16 at the time i didnt know where she was for two weeks i was forced to move with my grandmother in ny things were fine until i got into a my first serious relationship i got pregnant at 17 i was not prepared and was scared i didnt know or how to raise a child and didnt want to repeat the cycle i pushed them away i felt i deserved to be alone so that child ended up living with them i did my best to care of the baby i spent time with the baby on my days but i felt like i wouldnt be a good mother i am sorry i failed my child and my partner at that the time i love my child but they deserved 100 times better i am a worthless parent another reason not to feel sorry for me now fast forward to 2021 i had someone break into my apartment and sexual assault me and threaten me with a gun sadly he only got five year probation because i didnt report the assault or the break in due to me thinking i deserve it its my karma i lost my apartment was homeless living here and living there now i finally have an apartment but i never leave my apartment i just stay in here until i have to work i dont want any friends nor family to talk too i would rather be alone than to make anyone suffer anymore,post-pandemic,0.414686,0.14362384,0.0955986,0.7807406,0.08760871,0.80715424,0.300001,0.44391945

i f26 had some issuesfights at home around 3 months ago since then things have changed drastically with respect to my mental health initially i had really bad anxiety i took therapy to reduce that i thought with time ill start feeling better my anxiety has reduced but it has been replaced with sadness i feel sad most of the time like during the week sometimes i am all happy and engrossed in my work and then suddenly i get hit with this feeling of sadness i have started to zone out quite often and become forgetful i am getting more irritable by the day and insecure and extremely sensitive i get teary and overwhelmed very easily and rush to the washroom in the middle of the work to cry my lungs out to feel better this happens in random episodes i used to enjoy the company of my friends but recently i feel very distant and lonely around them i have lost contact with school and college friends so i feel more so lonely and incapable of making new friends something that is very confusing is that sometimes i am very motivated and other times i feel very hopeless and feel like nothing is going to change to the extent that it feels like a burden to keep living like this most of the time i feel this unsaid societal pressure like time is moving very fast and i am not able to catch up i feel little to no control over my life this might because of how i have seen woman have very little contribution into decisions regarding their lives in the past within the family and around sometimes it feels like i should leave everything here home city been living here since birth and move to a new city for a fresh start maybe that will make me feel better i am not sure why i feel this way neither do i remember the old me or how i used to feel before,post-pandemic,0.06323265,0.19595188,0.18211885,0.38422248,0.2524207,0.70181984,0.075875424,0.14079766

so ive been heavily depressed for the better part of a decade my mood has been with certain semi periodic exceptions stabilised to the point where im not self harming or attempting and i feel fine everything is fine not good not horrendous like it was for a long time but fine i still dont find joy in pretty much anything i cannot either motivate myself nor focus on nor remember to do the very basics like cleaning eating personal hygiene uni work anything but rotting in my room doing whatever im on 3 antidepressants at a moderate to high dose and on anxiety medication and hormone therapy it feels like the joy im supposed to feel is not there now hasnt been for a long time and perhaps never was there i struggle with many things both in the grander sense of the metaphorical demons i face as well as the simple actions that would constitute any sort of traditional normalcy i dont know how i go on i just exist its fine its all just the same monotonous drag of semi acceptable persistent existence its all such a slog and i dont know anymore why i do it as i said im fine and nobody needs to worry that im gonna do something to myself but just existing is still such a fucking pain the memory and concentration issues are getting to such a degree and have been there for a while that i had to switch universities because i didnt manage to do any work and failed 90 percent of my exams almost lost my health insurance because of this when i started at the new uni i had another episode that sent me to the mental hospital for two weeks until i felt good enough to leave i missed my therapy appointment today for i think the third time in a row because i forgot i havent been able to remember to brush my teeth for a while i cant focus on uni work or studying at all and have just been coasting on my existing knowledge with the dread of not being able to continue this very soon looming in the back of my head my brain feels fried to the point where i have trouble speaking sometimes im sorry for making you read this but i needed to get the feelings out to someone i know that theres others that need your support far more urgently ive been there and im glad im not at the moment,post-pandemic,0.074409716,0.21860157,0.29712552,0.72195405,0.21596657,0.84356105,0.15971273,0.33572504

hey guys so basically im looking for advice from either men with depression or those who have loved and supported men through depression i have anxiety myself my mum has bipolar and i have supported friends through mental illness and suicide losses this is not unknown territory for me at all but men are so hard to support my boyfriend of four years who i live with has clinical depression the first time he had a major episode in our relationship he almost became catatonic it was severe and i ended up breaking up with him because i was having a bad endometriosis flare at the time and i just couldnt cope with him not talking and refusing to get help we got back together 2 months later because he was mostly better and he made a commitment to me to get help ifwhen it came back it came back late 2022 and he was amazing he saw our gp got on a low dose of fluoxetine and has been pretty much good since then but its come back the last month again in him it typically presents as severe fatigue flatness numbness etc he becomes closed off with less and less emotion i believe its what you would class as typical clinical depression hes only recently admitted to me hes has this episodes his whole life but never got help until he met me ive been begging him to see our gp again before it spirals out of control like a few years ago but hes being really resistant i think hes worried about increasing his meds and having effects on his libido etc he will never try therapy trust me ive tried i hate seeing im like this hes like a shadow of himself do you have any ideas or has anyone gone through this or loved one like this i struggle so hard with it because im a talker and im the one who all my friends come to for support and advice i really am at a loss when someone is so closed off and distant like this i love him so much and i wont leave him again but i dont know how much longer i can deal with someone refusing to address it further i hate saying this out loud but being around this for long periods starts really getting me down myself as well,post-pandemic,0.09727262,0.12777583,0.12117251,0.46080294,0.19713382,0.77513325,0.084563546,0.12394573

hello everyone im looking for your advice here because im at my wits end i am m26 and have recently started dating my partner w26 we met a year ago at her workplace and then in october i had the courage to ask her if we could do something 1 month later we got together so far so good at first of course we were on cloud nine together we addressed every conflict and every problem immediately and were actually very harmonious with each other towards the end of december the time had come and she had what she calls quite a down she hardly ever got in touch was very distant etc at first i was convinced that this was just her way of being she is also taking a progestogen pill for medical reasons which can result in things such as a breakdown down phases and emotional unavailability after about 2 weeks we sat down together talked about everything and then everything was fine again but about 2 weeks ago the whole issue started all over again only this time it was worse nevertheless we went on a little trip to another city with my sister she gets on very well with her on this trip she behaved as she always does with me holding hands here kissing there everything was normal when we dropped my sister off after the trip and we were in the car i naturally asked her about the current situation she told me that everything was simply too much for her at the moment and that she was overwhelmed with everything according to her this should affect the relationship she is no longer at peace with herself and is completely dissatisfied with herself and doesnt know what to do but she definitely has feelings for me her job is currently so demanding and stressful that i dont think it will take much for her to burn out in addition she has a stressful family relationship and had to learn to cope on her own at an early age she spends a lot of time alone and isolates herself we then agreed to give her a week to just get her head back on straight but as is sometimes the case this uncertainty really gets you down you hardly have any contact during this time and are super distant so i came up with the super clever idea of writing to her about 12 times a day without success however she kept in touch with my sister only sporadically but still 15 weeks went by and we met up to talk to each other of course i apologized for my spamming at first she accepted that too after a bit of small talk and laughter we got down to business she was visibly nervous and barely managed to form a sentence she told me that she could see how much this distance was getting me down but she knows that in her current phase shes barely able to have a relationship and cant give me what i deserve or what im trying to give her she doesnt want to be a burden and doesnt want to get in the way of my life she doesnt know how she feels at the moment everything is uncertain for her at the moment she gets up in the morning goes to work comes home eats and goes back to sleep she has no energy or strength for anything she feels tired and exhausted and overwhelmed by everything accordingly she would suggest that we temporarily separate from each other so that when shes feeling better we can get back together i immediately blocked this and said that this was out of the question together to the end or not at all according to the motto i assured her that i had started to come to terms with this distance and that i would be there for her no matter what and that she could contact me at any time if anything happened she then said that she just didnt know when she would feel better again and what the result would be for our relationship and whether i would really be able to stand it we agreed on this in limbo but still together we hugged outside and said goodbye i kissed her on the forehead and said that we could do it lets move on to the present i hardly get any signs of life from her my sister and she are actually still in active contact according to my sister she comes home from work watches tv and then goes to sleep she behaves very isolated as i said she is overwhelmed by everything doesnt talk to me doesnt do anything and just keeps to herself she seems very emotionally numb she doesnt have a real support network either she is an emotionally cold mother who only demands and doesnt give but who has never seen her daughter as her favorite child she has a few friends but she rarely if ever talks to them about such issues now my question is in my eyes these are signs of depression and i no longer know how i should behave towards her or how i can help her we currently have no contact because she doesnt answer me do any of you have any ideas tldr i think my girlfriend is depressive she isolates herself and hardly talks to me i dont know what to do anymore she keeps in touch with my sister but thats it she seems emotionally dull and exhausted by life,post-pandemic,0.10348221,0.101982296,0.15961614,0.17965569,0.45554987,0.59888256,0.07634606,0.06565964

tw selfharm im a huge anime lover and one of my favorites is hell girl basically a cursed girl goes around exacting revenge upon people in exchange for the soul of the one seeking revenge ive been struggling a little lately with my depression but seemed to be on an upward trend however i got a little annoyed today over something incredibly minor and when my boyfriend asked me if i was okay it was line the floodgates opened up and i had a major depressive meltdown it felt like all of the hard work id put into improving and doing better didnt matter not a single bit none of my coping skills that is worked on mattered none of my soothing actions helped breathing techniques were worthless then when i remembered the one thing that helps me since i get a strong urge to throw and break things i like to break ice cubes to help myself calm down i was not able to carry it out because we didnt have any ice cubes which made me even more upset we havent had any arguments in close to 8 months and this was one of the worst ones weve ever had partially due to the fact that since im in panic mode my brain and mouth dont sync up and i just cant shut myself up i didnt just say things that i didnt really mean but i said how i actually felt about things too which since im autistic and my brain is incredibly hyperbolic can be rather extreme for context i mentioned how i wanted a lobotomy and how i feel like i should drink bleach so i could never talk again since i couldnt stop myself from talking im not going to do anything to harm myself since my boyfriend told me that he would break up with me if i ever did so i am not planning to selfharm i had a therapy appointment earlier in the day during which i had brought up being anxious about asking for anything my therapist obviously have me advice and tips but i told her that its a lot easier to just blame myself because not only am i used to being the one to blame but it also hurts less however in doing so im selfsabotaging because im just setting myself up to be hurt a lot of the time however i find myself not really being able to find a situation where someone hurt me where i wasnt to blame it could be because i have a guilt complex but when i think about the one who has hurt me the most the one to blame for all my pain it does just come back to myself and im not supposed to hate myself for that im supposed to love myself for that im supposed to see the good in myself for that ive just proven that the better i do the worse the fall will be over the tiniest of things and im not supposed to hate myself,post-pandemic,0.78393245,0.20560886,0.06032221,0.6466791,0.052453607,0.67486596,0.22164617,0.37954456

my psychiatrist recently upped my dose from 10mg to 15mg i had noticed my irritability and sadness was returning so she decided to increase it but now i cannot contain my suicidal thoughts i nearly jumped out of a moving car on friday and now as i sit here in my house alone all i can think about is how much of a burden i am to those around me how my emotions only cause problems not just for me but for everyone i exhaust the people i care most about and i dont even mean to my parents were never in the picture i have little family my siblings live out of state my close friends live hours away i have no children of my own and my husband thinks i am too much i truly feel as if i dont belong here i am currently in my externship for ma school i just turned 30 and i feel so lost i keep thinking about what it would be like if i just wandered off one day and just disappeared into the world or how easy it would be to just make a wrong turn i even started thinking about getting life insurance because if i do go through with anything at least maybe my husband will be okay financially i truly dont know what else to do other than check myself into a hospital,post-pandemic,0.2158492,0.1883721,0.7411428,0.9350455,0.82424456,0.91364604,0.24567312,0.7215849
hello im sorry if i break any rule in advance i cant think that clearly now i 17f have a sister whom i adore with all my heart 21f and share rooms with her due to lack of space in our household but we manage it i really dont know what exactly she has the only thing i know is that she tends to have what i can best describe as depressive episodes not wanting to get up not speaking much not coming out of the room much well she has a habit of being messy overall messy room messy car messy bathroom etc and my problem comes with the messy room and bathroom we have a bathroom for the two of us but most of the times is absolutely disgusting she has bulimia too if im not mistaken another thing i dont know how to process i understand that she has a problem and it is not her fault but sometimes i do get frustrated she also doesnt have the best aim when throwing toilet papers on the trash which is absolutely disgusting to me because we have the clothes next to it with the clothes she has a tendency to leave clothes in the floor too and thus most often than not there is clothing that its clean but i do not have a mean to know if it is or not besides doing a smell check i dont like doing the smell test if it isnt on something that i wore you may be asking yourself why do i in the first place have to do those on clothing that isnt mine and thats because she almost never cleans up her own messes and its up to me to clean it every time and that brings us to the room as i said earlier most of the times is extremely messy i consider myself as someone who likes having their room clean it gives me a sense of control in my surroundings but not to the point of ocd i like knowing where my things are seeing everything at least where i can see it having a room that smells nicely not having to walk in from school and see clothes scattered everywhere but every time i clean up the mess comes back in at most five days and its honestly demoralizing i used to do this without complaining and routinely because that was the only way of showing her my support but i cant do it anymore i cant stand watching as every time i clean up its basically useless even when i tell her to at least to pick up her clothes and put it where they belong its come to the point of me even having some episodes of not wanting to pick up something because i know it will be useless i have been sharing room with her since i was a child i know better than anyone what it is to endure her messes changes of behaviour sudden arguments it has been difficult i felt like i was her maid a lot of times and told my mom a lot of the times we moved some time ago but in out last house i couldnt take it and moved to my deceased grandmas room it terrified me because she died there because i couldnt deal with it anymore when we moved to the this house there were a room for each of us and i was so happy that period of time i had my messes too but i could control it and have my own space when i wanted due to some circunstances i had to move in to her room and since then i have missed my room dearly i cant talk it out with her because she will most probably either a tell me she is going to do it and to stop pestering her about it b say that im messy too and that it isnt entirely her fault or c block herself from me and vent to my mom its a loselose situation and my surrounding do play a big part on my mood overall proof of it being that the years that i was in my own bedroom i was one of the top of the class sorry if this is most venting but i do want to help my sister i do but i dont know how lately she has gotten more prone to getting mad and i know that there are a lot of times that she doesnt want me there but its not my fault i didnt have a choice but to give up my room thank you for reading if you have any tips please do post them,post-pandemic,0.17712858,0.1359766,0.1503135,0.4156517,0.25525227,0.67185,0.0699445,0.16421449

life was so much easier when i was still a student it had structure in a way stability that i felt like i didnt have when i graduated around 2 years ago and started working when i was a student all i had to worry about was doing well in school even if i barely passed there was no problem no real consequences but now that im out into the real world i feel like im floating in an endless sea its so large with no end in sight my only options are to sink or swim i want to swim but i feel like my fear is weighing me down and i end up sinking instead drowning in these awful feelings i dont know where im going with my life and that scares me i should be grateful that i have a job in this economy but these past few months the thought of resigning is eating me up inside i want to resign i want to drop everything leave and get rid of these responsibilities maybe then i wont spend my sundays crying and venting my feelings online im still doing it now crying venting but never actually doing anything for myself maybe im still a kid whos scared of everything and i wont ever change i fantasize a lot about what i should do with my life i want to draw i want to write i want to learn from my mom and manage the family business in her stead i want to learn how to play the piano and the flute i want to take commissions and earn money to at least sustain myself doing what i love but then i think of reality and everything just comes crashing down what about health care having a stable income to pay the bills stability insurance will i even catch peoples attention with the things i make when theres so many people much more skilled and have more experience than me what about my mother shes getting older she wont be here forever to support me what can i do to help what can i do so that she can live her older years comfortably when i was a kid lots of adults say that you can be anything you want to be when you grow up they dont say that you need money to do that lots of money to just live with s roof over your head you want freedom to do the things you want get some money first lots of it the worst thing about this is that i dont know what to do but to wallow in self pity its so easy to write motivational speeches its so easy to tell someone to endure it be grateful think about why youre doing this and use that as motivation if youre a strong person you can do that and im so jealous but to me negative thoughts seem louder and it feels nice to just cry my eyes out maybe one day i wont be able to cry anymore i want that day to come as soon as possible maybe i can finally get up not care about negative thoughts and just do what i want free of worry but its not today today ill just cry a little more and hope i can figure out how to dissociate in my current job and make my body move on auto pilot,post-pandemic,0.1386934,0.14553703,0.3545083,0.8780082,0.41434383,0.8571338,0.26639855,0.5306223

i am currently 19 years of age going to be 20 on march the 22nd and i want to die when i was young i was already unhappy and scared of being alone i was isolated by my family and i had no one to talk to at home so i would talk to myself as a means of making myself think im not alone while i was playing i mean could you imagine what a 5 year old imagines while hes alone in a dark room monsters scary ones which have haunted me till i was 12 used to be the class clown by making myself look bad so they laugh and then realized how being popular didnt mean you had friends i spent many days eating alone at primary even cried during a lesson cause i was scared of being alone my parents seeing that i was scared of being alone at home bought me a computer so i could be able to take my mind of things instead i ended up isolating myself even more from others i didnt need to talk to anyone anyways what i thought nobody could hurt me while i was playing but real people do even though i was playing on my computer i was still insulted for not being good enough when i would go to school i would hear the words fat here and there and i started working out on the treadmill everyday 9 years old as time passed i had friends which i talked to for years and just ignore me like they dont know me and then when they see me talk to me like nothing ever happened i tried to talk back to them as i didnt want to lose anyone even though i barely see them anymore having being alone even in secondary i started feeling major solitude eating alone at lunches talking to nobody as i think that they are going to make fun of me its funny how i thrived when they were laughing at me but now laughter haunts me i was even called strange for being the quiet kid which felt weird as i was the popular kid once i met a kid my age and we talked we joked and had fun could he be the one to cure my solitude he was a chill dude it was just us but then he started talking to others he was the first person to ask me to go out 13 years old he started acting differently and started deserting me like the others but he even made fun of me with his friends spreading rumors and making me feel like total shit but since he was the popular kid i couldnt really stop being his friend since i couldnt do group work and since i didnt have any other friends i stuck to him for 3 more years listening to him degrading me to utter shit while i put a fake mask taking it all while in high school i aimed to continue to lose weight and get a six pack someday my parents bought me a dog since i begged them for a sibling werent able to reproduce again i loved that dog and treated him like my brother ever since he has slept with me while i was crying and cheered me up but i was still lonely and had dark thoughts i started planning on finding a day to kill my self my mum forced me to go to place for teens and there was a drama section so i went there it was cool since i love movies i met a group of girl teens which opened up to me i thought to myself that i will give it another chance and delay the date to kms they texted me back and even planned on going out i was skeptical of them and thought they would leave like the others but they stuck for a while in the mean time i was asked by a girl if she wanted a relationship i didnt really like her but i wanted to feel loved after a few months i broke up with her it was painful but a big relief i then found out that another girl from our group liked me so i asked her if she wanted to be my gf and lasted but i lost feelings and we broke up i missed her and we got back together we did this for 3 more times until we decided to stop before i told her wanted to break up on the last break up i held it in for 6 months and started smoking after work cause i didnt have the courage to tell a nice girl that i lost feelings even though she treated me well i finally told her we talked it out and stayed as friends in the meantime i worked out very hard after a sudden question came to my mind are you satisfied with yourselfstarted aiming at having a strong and muscular physique then a fight broke down and the group separated in 2 and i went with a side even though i wanted both i kept the smoking habit my friends kept distancing themselves from me little by little as they met new friends they then introduced me to their new friends what i saw was people who enjoyed smoking cigarettes weed and drinking but i wanted to fit in so i smoked even more then usual and got drunk once then i met a girl who was very beautiful and i just scuffed her as a friend as i knew i was out of her league and thought of her as a friend even though i had thoughts about her at night one day she flirted with me and i was really happy the next day she asked me if i was coming to the usual place and i said yes happy to see her i spot her with another dude while the others tell her to kiss him and etc i was heartbroken like seriously i drank a lot that day and smoked the whole packet and told them i was going home due to a family emergency she called me later that day and she asked me if i was drunk because of her i denied it at first then i told her the truth she said that she didnt really like him but they kind of forced both of them to be together then she said she liked me i was so happy that day she was perfect from top to bottom we argued a lot but it was fun then i get a call while im in my car driving home after finishing from the gym its her i greet her happily and i hear her crying angerly saying i wasnt doing enough i begged her to stay but she left i was so broken i wanted to crash my car and die that day but i loved my car as if it was a part of me i went home put a fake mask so my parents dont ask and cried in my room the day after i drank and smoked 2 packets of cigarettes i was so drunk i could barely walk straight crying while i was walking in the middle of the roads my friends saw me and took me home i yelled screamed cried and even laughed at myself then i went quiet all on the way home the next day came and i shut myself to everyone for a week and decided to stop smoking after some time i went out with my friends i met her again i saw her beautiful face and i just wanted to burst in tears but i just tried to talk normally after months we became friends again like nothing ever happened then she invited me to go to a luna park i never went to anything like this before i only went were my friends went besides the cinema i knew she planned on trying to take me back so i kissed her and we got back together and i couldnt be happier we have done a lot together and i was happy for our memories then even though i tried my hardest to keep my end of the bargain on my side she seemed to be more distant and barely talked to me when she was out with her friends i locked myself in the restroom and cried at work knowing she was losing interest i told her after a while that she couldnt keep doing this but she said that she couldnt change i then decided to break up with her i felt a slight sense of relief at the time later on i had a few glimpses of our memories on some days which made me start smoking from time to time my friends had been gossiping and making fun of certain people on the group i also felt like i was becoming distant i was focused on the gym and if i had extra time i would maybe go out with them then they started distancing themselves to me and i still kept thinking about my ex then one day my dad had the thought of ending his life because of work issues it really hurt me since he didnt think of our memories that we had and all we did together i have retained the same feeling of when i wanted to kill my self that day from loneliness if not worse the gym has helped me in many ways

ive always suffered from depression ever since i was 10 years old the reason i say 10 specifically is because that was the year my mom had me and my siblings move to a different state away from all of my friends and family socially i never recovered i was immediately the target of bullying from the fifth grade onward four of them tried to drown me in the school swimming pool and school faculty did nothing about it was made fun of for finding comfort in reading about animals and then found comfort in manga where i could pretend decent people in public schools actually exist from grade seven to ten i was then bullied by a couple of teachers one made it a point to make fun of my acne skinny frame and high cheek bones another teacher had constantly verbally abused her students for asking for clarificationsimple questions i also got sexually assaulted multiple times and school board did nothingmy parents didnt believe me continued on until graduation flunked out of college worked for a few years on a sheep farm and was subjected to the employer playing a ton of mind games with me gaslighting me into thinking that i didnt water the sheep only to find out that she was knocking troughs over among other nonsense then when i quit she doxed me and my spouse then defamed us on the internet so whenever i google my name i see her insane lies thrown at me im tired of explaining that situation to people especially because webmasters wont remove the offending posts then a few years ago my father was murdered by a homeless guy and ive been subjected to having my grief be minimized by people telling me i should forgive the homeless guy for being schizophrenic tbh i hope the homeless guy steps on legos and thumbtacks in prison for the rest of his life i want to die but i dont want to try suicide because i already tried three times and fucked up horribly each time my liver got fucked up last time i tried it so i guess ill just wait eagerly for my time to arrive,post-pandemic,0.25925717,0.13036786,0.0779167,0.594624,0.103170395,0.77913636,0.10729458,0.22323203
