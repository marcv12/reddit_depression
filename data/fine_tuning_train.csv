heres to being lonely i say that because despite its crushing feeling at the best of times it makes me aware of what others may be suffering through it makes us go the extra effort to make sure that our peers always know theyre loved and wanted we are there when people need us gone if they dont very few remember we exist other than when they see us out or at the things we may or may not attend we love more hug tighter cherish a persons attention and time cause we know what its like to feel abandoned alone and miserable in silence being lonely may suck big time but it gives great insight on how to care for others as few may do it for us,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1

i go to a large university and am graduating after 4 years in just a few days i have no new truly meaningful relationships to show for it i never made any close friends of my own either through classes work or the extracurricular group i was heavily involved in it seemed so easy for everyone else but i always feel like an outsider i really have no one yet ive heard it only gets harder i think my introversion and social awkwardness has damned me to a life of loneliness it seems as though im offputting to people sometimes or just not viewed as approachable but in reality im just shy and assume no one is interested in getting to know me to begin with so i dont often engage first which is probably a selfesteem issue but anyways im just reflecting i miss the feeling of close friendship 3,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1

i started seeing a therapist about 2 months ago ive never had a therapist and i kinda was hoping it might help me but the guys a dick he makes me feel like shit he talks at me for about a hour repeating the exact same thing every time trying to explain what mindfulness is he barely lets me get a word in and refuses to acknowledge that this minefulness stuff isnt working for me he also likes to dismiss all my morals and has told me multiple times to stop caring about stuff and if i try and explain why i care he changes the subject to mindfulness also he only ever talks about shit from that netflix series called headspace its like he watched the first episode and all he knows about anything i cant even get a new therapist as i cant get another due to multiple reasons so im either stuck with a dick who makes me feel crap or i give up with therapy and then get kicked out as im only allowed to live at home aslong as im talking to a therapist that also kinda sucks,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1
ok so ive been heavily depressed for the good part of 6 years now and last year i started getting suicidal when my dad found out he sat me down and told me to buck the fuck up he said that my life is too good for this what could i possibly want more of and that his own life is much harder than mine so i need to man up and appreciate what i have i understand where hes coming from gratitude can be very helpful to people who are feeling depressed but i already know and am thankful for what i have this whole situation is made worse when i cant tell him that hes probably the reason for the depression and suicidal thoughts as a result of his relentless psychological physical and mental abuse everyday since i was 2 16m im not quite sure what to do as i want therapy but he not only doesnt want me to get it but he also used to be a psychologist for 10 years so he cant be persuaded that hes wrong if anybody has any ideas let me know,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0

it frustrates me that people who dont suffer from mental health issues dont understand that it is a 24 hours a day 7 days a week deal you cant just turn it off and its not as simple as talking to a therapist a few times and feeling better it isnt that easy they all say oh ive been there but have you do you really being honest with yourself know what its like to suffer all day every day and have people blame you for something you cannot help and make assumptions about you because of it if you had been there id hope youd be more understanding at least but you arent because you havent been there and you dont get it stop fooling yourself and maybe listen rather than taking over the conversation and silencing those who actually suffer in favour of presenting theories on what you think its like,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

hey everyone i have a question that has been on my mind lately im curious about how single and unmarried individuals without family spend their time we all know that having a support system and loved ones around can make a significant difference in our lives but there are also those who navigate life on their own if you fall into this category or know someone who does id love to hear about how you spend your time and make the most of your independence do you have any unique hobbies activities or routines that keep you engaged and fulfilled are there any challenges you face as a result of not having immediate family members to rely on i believe that hearing about your experiences can provide valuable insights and inspiration to others in similar situations so please feel free to share your thoughts and suggestions lets create a supportive space where we can learn from each other and celebrate the diverse ways in which we lead fulfilling lives even without a traditional family structure looking forward to reading your stories and tips,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

i find it ironic that the world says anyone thats struggling with mental health problems should speak out but when we try to talk to someone seek help were labelled as liars attention seekers ive struggled with depression anxiety since i was 12 but wasnt diagnosed until i was 19 because if i tried to open up about how i was feeling i was instantly dismissed doctors said its probably just puberty friends family said i was just being a typical moody teenager so i just kept everything bottled up pushed it down which only made it all worse no one seemed to listen or give a shit until one day i accidentally rolled up my hoodie sleeves in front of my mum she saw the cuts scars covering both of my forearms i had been doing that for 2 years without it being noticed by anyone she asked why i didnt come to her i simply ecplained that i had tried but no one listened or seemed to care so please try check up on people and listen to how they are feeling before it gets to that point or even worse,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

i have no idea why i got married i guess it makes a certain amount of sense if you are going to have kids but still my ex and i bought a house together before we got married and life was great it just makes so much sense to have separate finances and share expenses as decided the whole marriage aspect opens up a lot of problems if there are inequalities in the marriage if one person works 80 hours and makes 400000 and the other person decides to smoke weed all day they suddenly feel super entitled to half of the 400000 even after a divorce i dont ever want to get married ever again people change and you never really now what you are signing up for on top of that the risk that you could end up paying someone after a divorce is real and ridiculous getting on your feet money excluded i know it is for the kids but im going to have to pay my ex child support which if course i do but if he just tried he could easily make what i make so frustrating,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1

so i am currently in high school going into junior year ive been dealing with loneliness all my life at first in freshman year i thought that i needed to find a group to be a part of and felt like being lonely was a bad thing but then my mental health went down the drain and for sophomore year i was sent to a residential facility in provo utah i was there from august early april at that place i met a lot of cool people and it was the most friends i ever had but after i got out my loneliness came back because most of them live in la and i live in the south bay areasix hour drive after that i kinda just accepted loneliness because its not worth messing yourself up just for friends in high school which youll probably never talk to again once high school finishes it gave me a lot of time to focus on my goals in life and make myself a better person so for all those people that feel like crap for being lonely know that there are plus sides to loneliness as well,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

for whoever needs to hear this today you are valid and you are valuable do not let yourself be defined by your diagnosis you are more than just a collection of the things that are wrong with you you are a person and you are who you are in spite of these things not because of them never let anyone belittle you because of your struggles you are stronger than the people who grit their teeth and bear it because they have not had to jump the same hurdles as you to get where you are it is never shameful or weak to ask for help anyone who tells you otherwise has forgotten that they once had to be spoon fed as a child or has forgotten how many times theyve had to ask their grandchildren to fix their computer stay the path it may be long it may come with unexpected turns but eventually there is light at the end you are valid you are valuable,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
