my mum had a boyfriend when i was around 6 or 7 she met him while she was volunteering at a prison he was incarcerated for 15 years following a spate of armed robberies when he was released she promptly moved him in with us i found out that the only reason he was released is because she told the parole board that he could move in with us what kind of a parent does that a few years later after we escaped from him he ended up shooting a guy 4 times in the kneecaps in a mcdonalds parking lot and was sentenced to another decade or so in prison guns arent easy to come by in australia,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0

i often see interest in discord servers for loneliness but how about a podcast i have experience in creating shows so it would be a highquality one but would also be authentic and noncorporate there are a few such podcasts already but they are kind of corporate and limited series my idea for the show would be 13 monologue shows with me covering different topics about loneliness 13 interviews with experts or personalities 13 interviews with average people who are lonely i would not just focus on potential solutions to loneliness but also just produce with the goal of providing solidarity in mind another option is to do a youtube channel but it would have to be less indepth please let me know your thoughts because im stretched pretty thin but would like to do it if theres interest i think there would be nothing sadder than a podcast about loneliness that no one listens to so id like to gauge interest before i proceed,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0

they say people who commit suicide are selfish for not caring about everyone around them being sad when you commit suicide usually you believe with all your heart that everyone in the world would be better off without you or that they dont care it is the most unselfish thing i can think of not saying its a good idea but being able to give up your own life just to make everyone a little happier even if it doesnt actually but just in the persons head is not selfish its horrible tragic but not selfish x200b edit im not suicidal by the way and dudes stop insinuating suicide is okay when you have a mental illness suicide is never ok but we need to not guilt people into not committing suicide,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0

so i am currently in high school going into junior year ive been dealing with loneliness all my life at first in freshman year i thought that i needed to find a group to be a part of and felt like being lonely was a bad thing but then my mental health went down the drain and for sophomore year i was sent to a residential facility in provo utah i was there from august early april at that place i met a lot of cool people and it was the most friends i ever had but after i got out my loneliness came back because most of them live in la and i live in the south bay areasix hour drive after that i kinda just accepted loneliness because its not worth messing yourself up just for friends in high school which youll probably never talk to again once high school finishes it gave me a lot of time to focus on my goals in life and make myself a better person so for all those people that feel like crap for being lonely know that there are plus sides to loneliness as well,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

when my only diagnosis was depression and anxiety i was easily pitied and white knighted either by boys who thought being suicidal and helpless was sexy or with half assed attempts from mental health workers volunteers well my bpd symptoms got worse instead of sulking when i am feeling self doubt or low self esteem i immediately project and lash out this comes from a place of extreme pain and years of trauma but because it is a stark contrast to the inwardness of depression i rarely get the same attitude i did when i didnt mention bpd symptoms i see it constantly no regard for anger as a mental health symptom in support communities pointing fingers and calling the aggressive psychopathic etc people will advocate when youre all cute and quiet and tiny and not making any noise once your mental illness becomes external and your pain manifests into outbursts and aggression its completely dismissed and the person is disregarded and abandoned this is why i am so afraid of having bpd but thats beside the point i was wondering if you guys had any experience with this phenomenon,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

so since april 2022 im seeing my first therapist because of social phobia and depression i really like him and im very glad i ended up with him and that i feel comfortable but know im questioning myself if hes just nice or actually helpful do you know what i mean like he is a great person and all but what if he isnt actually helping me the only odd thing i can point out is that he often tells me that my social phobia could get better if im getting more independent moving out getting a job etc which is very hard to impossible for me why do i find this odd because ofc this should be a goal for me but to reach this goal i need to overcome my social phobia and depress its not possible to solve an issue with the goal itself he also believes that i dont need medical treatment although i do believe that and am taking however can u explain how i spot if hes a nice or a helpful therapist,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

i realized that no matter how painful life is you can only depend on yourself in the end maybe some people will care and will give you some time but nobody will try to hold your hand when you will fall life is painful yes and people will ghost and leave you when you need them the most for them it doesnt matter what happens to you sometimes in the end you deal with your own problems so stop waiting for someone to help you someone to stop you from being lonely looking for a partner is not a solution for your depression you can trust people but never 100 even if it does sound harsh you have no idea when that person will leave you this is what i had to face and its my opinion just be strong and dont always depend on someone for your happiness,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0

heres to being lonely i say that because despite its crushing feeling at the best of times it makes me aware of what others may be suffering through it makes us go the extra effort to make sure that our peers always know theyre loved and wanted we are there when people need us gone if they dont very few remember we exist other than when they see us out or at the things we may or may not attend we love more hug tighter cherish a persons attention and time cause we know what its like to feel abandoned alone and miserable in silence being lonely may suck big time but it gives great insight on how to care for others as few may do it for us,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1

no dad until i guess quite recently my abusive mother would make me hug her post beatings just for her own selfish justifications so feeling safe in a hug is a huge thing for me im convinced my lack of affection is what causes most of my anxiety because being left alone with no attention and feeling forgotten about was a huge thing when i was a child so i guess i feel the same now which is why its bringing back all the memories of being locked in the corridor for hours on end weeks at a time it definitely sounds sad and pathetic to people who havent been through this type of trauma but i definitely believe the lack of affection ive received is sending me into a state of alarm because im scared to be forgotten about again idek why i typed this but i guess it helps to organise my thoughts,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0

depression is a void that eats at you slowly something that creeps up on you the second youre not distracted a numbness feelings dont stick around no matter how enjoyable they are and the gaps between them feel immeasurable its a constant regret of the past and dread of the coming you want everyone and nothing you want to be happy and yet you also just want it to all go away and stay away the worst part is when you still manage to function you get up and eat and drink and work and chat but at night you feel that numbness the craving for something other than this emptiness slowly carving away from the inside out too slow to notice by eye without a timelapse more people would realize they have depression and less people would misuse the word depression and less people would be harsh to depressed people because they view it as just being a little sad if only,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0

its like a recipe for disaster its like one moment you were somebody they cared deeply about and appreciated the next minute a episode hits and they tell you that you deserve better they progressively get colder and more distant they begin to criticize you project their feeling on to you and make you seem like the bad guy meanwhile friends see a completey masked happy version of them you feel alienated further and further and eventually want out then you get push and pull behaviors which just add more damage eventually so much resentment has built that you escape and they lash out for abandoning them you end up carrying the emotional pain of feeling like you abandoned someone in their time of need its like you completely forget that their behavior caused this whether purposely or subconsciously they did this doesnt matter depression will distort the sufferers thinking and view your actions as selfish when you have tried your hardest to be empathetic and understanding,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1

can i take constructive criticism generally yes however getting criticized many times over little things gives me anxiety that makes me angry because 1 i often times cant escape the feeling of anxiety when criticized 2 i try to be pretty agreeable to avoid displeasing people so when that expectation isnt met and people still criticize me i get angry and resentful because it feels like there is nothing i can do to please them which makes me feel like there is no way to get away from my anxiety i also end up feeling like a victim which makes me feel weak and disempowered which i hate this also makes me angry lol so my question is can i choose to not feel anxiety in situations like this and how if i cant just choose not to feel it how do i deal with it what is the healthy end goal that i should have if ending the feeling of anxiety isnt possible thanks everyone,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

so as it turns out you can do all the cooking all the cleaning do all the errands take care of the kids let him sleep in every weekend work a full time career making decent money support his hopes goals and dreams wholeheartedly be his unpaid therapist make all of his doctors appointments pay all the bills on time do all the laundry and your spouse will still ask you for a divorce because youre too btchy and miserable this came after i wrote him a letter asking him for help and expressing some grievances about his behavior that i heavily sugar coated so he wouldnt feel completely attacked im emotionally fragile and going through all the stages of grief it seems i didnt want a divorce i just wanted him to be a team player idk how im just so disposable he doesnt even seem upset meanwhile ive been crying on and off the last 24 hours,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1
i have finally recognized that a dynamic that i am in is toxic and i want to end it we are just friends as of now but im not sure if i should tell him specifically that i no longer want to be a part of his life or if i should just slowly let it die out since hes in the ignoring me phase and only giving me breadcrumbs every now and again so that i dont leave im not sure i can deal with the subtle guilt trip in the form of him finally taking responsibility for his actions to keep me hooked its kind of a performance that he does that echoes the way that i apologize but with more excuses and then emphasizes how much he has enjoyed being friends with me in a sullen way that makes me question whether im overreacting or not and makes me feel guilty but ultimately does not inform how he acts in the future in the slightest,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0

something that often comes to mind its common for a lot of people suffering with depression to feel that life is pointless and a waste of time when i think about it the only logical purpose to our existence is to procreate which arguably could be seen as pointless as its ultimately unfulfillable this train of thought always leads me to the same answer which is that my depression isnt caused by some sort of chemical imbalance or poor circumstances but the understanding that my life is in fact pointless is this shared and if so how do you overcome or bypass these thoughts to allow a productive life,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1

so my severely depressed ex came back into my life and i can tell he really is trying his hardest to do better and to have open communications with me whenever he is feeling down or needing space weve been together for about 3 years in the past and even had a few on and offs in this relationship but i love him and even with the time apart we had i never once stopped and i do believe him but how can you get past the fact that at any moment they can revert back to their depressed self that pushes everyone away thats my biggest fear is that while we are taking things slow and both doing our best to understand and learn from each other him as the one needing support and me being the one to show support how we can best explain ourselves and make ourselves feel understood with each other x200b any success stories to share could use some hope today just to help lessen my anxiety,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

i know this is fucked up but i feel like no one cares about me no matter what i do or say no one ever worries about me no one ever notices my cries for help i just feel like the only way to make them notice how shitty im actually doing is by doing something drastic like this but then again would anyone even care,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1

i have a really hard time connecting with people but i absolutely adore cats i have been struggling a lot with how lonely i am these days and am currently trying to adopt a cat well it isnt going very well because almost every shelter requires personal references and specifies besides family and i literally dont have any friends just now i found this one cat that i think could be perfect but the application requires not one but three personal references it seems like this keeps happening i literally cant think of anybody id be comfortable with asking i know how to take care of cats really well i think but apparently my loneliness is a disqualifier i thought a cat could be a balm to how alone i am but ironically this process feels like its just rubbing it in,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0
well so my wifes best friend came over and after my wife said something about our divorce said friend let her have it well i am not gonna stay silent any more i really believed that this was a temporary thing and that you would be able to work things out with him i believe this is the most stupid thing you ever did and that you are going to regret it there may have been some small issues but nothing that couldnt been resolved if only you would have been willing to put in the effort i know he is he is a good man and has done so much for you and your children some times you will only realize what you had when you lost it and i think that is where you are headed or something close to it i felt great wife not so much by the look on her face it will change nothing probably but it still felt great to hear from someone that i am not that close to,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

ever since me and my wife separated its been a rather traumatic experience for me having to leave my kids behind ive been going to several support groups for many different reasons and taking psych meds for my depression and anxiety and they seem to be slowly helping but i still find myself feeling stuck or slowly descending back into that pit of despair i do my best to keep from falling but i still do fromm time to time when my thoughts start to become chaotic and crazy usually when im alone which is most of the time to help me cope with these feelings i go for a walk or try to find something to do to keep my mind occupied and busy but it doesnt always work but im still depressed and become anxious at times and i can feel alone even in a crowd of people which triggers my anxiety very high i cant stand large groups of people especially in confined spaces it freaks me out but oddly i also get anxious when im alone so im anxious almost all the time except when around just a few people at a time then i feel pretty comfortable,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0

you are worthy of love and friendship no matter what we think of ourselves no matter what causes your sadness and loneliness life can still be ok it doesnt need to be be amazing like how the shows portray them i realized that shows and movies have given lots of people hyper realistic but not real expectations of love and friendship nobody in general have love stories like the disney or hallmark movies or even expectacular friendships where you have these group of friends where you can talk about anything like the big bang theory maybe thats why it drives our longing and want for such feelings and belongings this might be a phase or a long term suffering but i hope that you can weave through life and finally find someone nice a significant other or just a friend who will listen the journey will be tough treacherous and full of uncertainties but you can figure it out if you try your best think of it as a quest i see you and wish you the best,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0
